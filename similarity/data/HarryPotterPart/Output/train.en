Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 
CHAPTER ONE : THE BOY WHO LIVED 
Mr . and Mrs . Dursley , of number four , Privet Drive , were proud to say that they were perfectly normal , thank you very much . 
Mr . Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings , which made drills . 
He was a big , beefy man with hardly any neck , although he did have a very large mustache . 
Mrs . Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck , which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences , spying on the neighbors . 
The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it . 
Mrs . Potter was Mrs . Dursley's sister , but they hadn't met for several years
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street . 
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son , too , but they had never even seen him . 
When Mr . and Mrs . Dursley woke up on the dull , gray Tuesday our story starts , there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country . 
None of them noticed a large , tawny owl flutter past the window . 
At half past eight , Mr . Dursley picked up his briefcase , pecked Mrs . Dursley on the cheek , and tried to kiss Dudley good - bye but missed , because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls . 
He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive . 
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map . 
Then he jerked his head around to look again . 
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive , but there wasn't a map in sight . 
Mr . Dursley blinked and stared at the cat . 
It stared back . 
As Mr . Dursley drove around the corner and up the road , he watched the cat in his mirror . 
It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no , looking at the sign ; cats couldn't read maps or signs . 
Mr . Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind . 
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day . 
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by . 
They were whispering excitedly together . 
The nerve of him ! 
But then it struck Mr . Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something ... yes , that would be it . 
The traffic moved on and a few minutes later , Mr . Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot , his mind back on drills . 
Mr . Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor . 
He yelled at five different people . 
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more . 
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime , when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery . 
He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's . 
He eyed them angrily as he passed . 
He didn't know why , but they made him uneasy . 
It was on his way back past them , clutching a large doughnut in a bag , that he caught a few words of what they were saying . 
" The Potters , that's right , that's what I heard yes , their son , Harry " 
Mr . Dursley stopped dead . 
He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them , but thought better of it . 
He dashed back across the road , hurried up to his office , snapped at his secretary not to disturb him , seized his telephone , and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind . 
He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache , thinking ... no , he was being stupid . 
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry . 
He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that ... but all the same , those people in cloaks ... 
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o ' clock , he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door . 
It was a few seconds before Mr . Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak . 
He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground . 
On the contrary , his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare , " Don't be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! 
Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! " 
And the old man hugged Mr . Dursley around the middle and walked off . 
Mr . Dursley stood rooted to the spot . 
He was rattled . 
As he pulled into the driveway of number four , the first thing he saw - and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning . 
It was now sitting on his garden wall . 
He was sure it was the same one ; it had the same markings around its eyes . 
" Shoo ! " said Mr . Dursley loudly . 
It just gave him a stern look . 
Mr . Dursley wondered . 
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife . 
Mr . Dursley tried to act normally . 
When Dudley had been put to bed , he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news : " And finally , bird - watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today . 
" Most mysterious . 
And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . 
Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? " 
" Well , Ted , " said the weatherman , " I don't know about that , but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . 
Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they ' ve had a downpour of shooting stars ! 
But I can promise a wet night tonight . " 
Mr . Dursley sat frozen in his armchair . 
Mrs . Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea . 
It was no good . 
He'd have to say something to her . 
He cleared his throat nervously . 
As he had expected , Mrs . Dursley looked shocked and angry . 
" No , " she said sharply . 
" Why ? " 
" Funny stuff on the news , " Mr . Dursley mumbled . 
" So ? " snapped Mrs . Dursley . 
" Well , I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... her crowd . " 
Mrs . Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips . 
Mr . Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name " Potter . " 
Instead he said , as casually as he could , " Their son - he'd be about Dudley's age now , wouldn't he ? " 
" What's his name again ? 
" Harry . 
" Oh , yes , " said Mr . Dursley , his heart sinking horribly . 
" Yes , I quite agree . " 
He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed . 
While Mrs . Dursley was in the bathroom , Mr . Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden . 
The cat was still there . 
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something . 
If it did ... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well , he didn't think he could bear it . 
Mrs . Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr . Dursley lay awake , turning it all over in his mind . 
The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind .... 
How very wrong he was . 
Mr . Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep , but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness . 
In fact , it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all . 
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching , appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground . 
The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed . 
He was wearing long robes , a purple cloak that swept the ground , and high - heeled , buckled boots . 
This man's name was Albus Dumbledore . 
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome . 
He was busy rummaging in his cloak , looking for something . 
But he did seem to realize he was being watched , because he looked up suddenly at the cat , which was still staring at him from the other end of the street . 
For some reason , the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him . 
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket . 
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter . 
He flicked it open , held it up in the air , and clicked it . 
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop . 
Twelve times he clicked the Put - Outer , until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance , which were the eyes of the cat watching him . 
Dumbledore slipped the Put - Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four , where he sat down on the wall next to the cat . 
He didn't look at it , but after a moment he spoke to it . 
" Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . " 
He turned to smile at the tabby , but it had gone . 
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe - looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes . 
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun . 
" How did you know it was me ? " she asked . 
" My dear Professor , I ' ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly . " 
" All day ? 
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily . 
" You'd think they'd be a bit more careful , but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on . 
She jerked her head back at the Dursleys'dark living - room window . 
" I heard it . 
Flocks of owls ... shooting stars .... Well , they ' re not completely stupid . 
" You can't blame them , " said Dumbledore gently . 
" I know that , " said Professor McGonagall irritably . 
She threw a sharp , sideways glance at Dumbledore here , as though hoping he was going to tell her something , but he didn't , so she went on . 
" A what ? " 
" A lemon drop . 
" As I say , even if You - Know - Who has gone - " 
" My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? 
All this ' You - Know - Who ' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort . " 
" But you ' re different . 
" You flatter me , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" Voldemort had powers I will never have . " 
" It's lucky it's dark . 
You know what everyone's saying ? 
About what finally stopped him ? " 
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss , the real reason she had been waiting on a cold , hard wall all day , for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now . 
It was plain that whatever " everyone " was saying , she was not going to believe it until 
Dumbledore told her it was true . 
Dumbledore , however , was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer . 
He went to find the Potters . 
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they ' re -- dead . 
Dumbledore bowed his head . 
Professor McGonagall gasped . 
I can't believe it ... 
I didn't want to believe it ... Oh , Albus ... " 
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder . 
" I know ... 
I know ... " he said heavily . 
Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on . 
" That's not all . 
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son , Harry . 
But -- he couldn't . 
No one knows why , or how , but they ' re saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter , Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone . 
Dumbledore nodded glumly . 
" It's -- it's true ? " faltered Professor McGonagall . 
" After all he's done ... all the people he's killed ... he couldn't kill a little boy ? 
It's just astounding ... of all the things to stop him ... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? " 
" We can only guess , " said Dumbledore . " We may never know . " 
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles . 
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it . 
It was a very odd watch . 
It had twelve hands but no numbers ; instead , little planets were moving around the edge . 
It must have made sense to Dumbledore , though , because he put it back in his pocket and said , " Hagrid's late . 
I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here , by the way ? " 
" Yes , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" I ' ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . 
" Dumbledore -- you can't . 
I ' ve been watching them all day . 
And they ' ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . 
Harry Potter come and live here ! " 
" It's the best place for him , " said Dumbledore firmly . 
" His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older . 
I ' ve written them a letter . " 
" A letter ? " repeated Professor McGonagall faintly , sitting back down on the wall . 
" Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? 
These people will never understand him ! 
He ' ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name ! " 
" It would be enough to turn any boy's head . 
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth , changed her mind , swallowed , and then said , " Yes -- yes , you ' re right , of course . 
But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? " 
" Hagrid's bringing him . " 
I would trust Hagrid with my life , " said Dumbledore . 
He does tend to -- what was that ? " 
It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight ; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them . 
If the motorcycle was huge , it was nothing to the man sitting astride it . 
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide . 
He looked simply too big to be allowed , and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face , he had hands the size of trash can lids , and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins . 
In his vast , muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets . 
" Hagrid , " said Dumbledore , sounding relieved . 
And where did you get that motorcycle ? " 
" No problems , were there ? " 
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets . 
Under a tuft of jet - black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut , like a bolt of lightning . 
" Is that where - ? " whispered Professor McGonagall . 
" Yes , " said Dumbledore . " He ' ll have that scar forever . " 
" Even if I could , I wouldn't . 
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . 
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys ' house . 
" Could I -- could I say good - bye to him , sir ? " asked Hagrid . 
Then , suddenly , Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog . 
" Shhh ! " hissed Professor McGonagall , " you ' ll wake the Muggles ! " 
" Yes , yes , it's all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we ' ll be found , " Professor McGonagall whispered , patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door . 
He laid Harry gently on the doorstep , took a letter out of his cloak , tucked it inside Harry's blankets , and then came back to the other two . 
For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle ; Hagrid's shoulders shook , Professor McGonagall blinked furiously , and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out . 
" Well , " said Dumbledore finally , " that's that . 
G ' night , Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore , sir . " 
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve , Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life ; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night . 
" I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall , " said Dumbledore , nodding to her . 
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply . 
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street . 
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put - Outer . 
He clicked it once , and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street . 
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four . 
" Good luck , Harry , " he murmured . 
He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak , he was gone . 
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive , which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky , the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen . 
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up . 
One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on , not knowing he was special , not knowing he was famous , not knowing he would be woken in a few hours ' time by Mrs . Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles , nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley ... 
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step , but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all . 
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys ' front door ; it crept into their living room , which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr . Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls . 
Ten years ago , there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different - colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby , and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle , on a carousel at the fair , playing a computer game with his father , being hugged and kissed by his mother . 
Yet Harry Potter was still there , asleep at the moment , but not for long . 
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day . 
" Up ! Get up ! Now ! " 
Harry woke with a start . 
His aunt rapped on the door again . 
Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove . 
He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having . 
It had been a good one . 
He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before . 
His aunt was back outside the door . 
" Nearly , " said Harry . 
" Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . 
And don't you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday . " 
Harry groaned . 
" What did you say ? " his aunt snapped through the door . 
" Nothing , nothing ... " 
Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten ? 
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks . 
Harry was used to spiders , because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them , and that was where he slept . 
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen . 
The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents . 
It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted , not to mention the second television and the racing bike . 
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry , as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody . 
Harry didn't look it , but he was very fast . 
He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's , and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was . 
Harry had a thin face , knobbly knees , black hair , and bright green eyes . 
He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose . 
The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning . 
He had had it as long as he could remember , and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt 
" In the car crash when your parents died , " she had said . 
Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys . 
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon . 
About once a week , Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut . 
Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together , but it made no difference , his hair simply grew that way - all over the place . 
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother . 
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon . 
Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig . 
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table , which was difficult as there wasn't much room . 
Dudley , meanwhile , was counting his presents . 
His face fell . 
" That's two less than last year . " 
Harry , who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on , began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over . 
How's that , popkin ? 
Two more presents . 
Is that all right '' 
Dudley thought for a moment . 
Finally he said slowly , " So I ' ll have thirty ... thirty ... " 
" Thirty - nine , sweetums , " said Aunt Petunia . 
" Oh . " Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel . 
" All right then . " 
Uncle Vernon chuckled . 
" Little tyke wants his money's worth , just like his father . 
He ruffled Dudley's hair . 
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike , a video camera , a remote control airplane , sixteen new computer games , and a VCR . 
He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried . 
" Mrs . 
She jerked her head in Harry's direction . 
Dudley's mouth fell open in horror , but Harry's heart gave a leap . 
Every year on Dudley's birthday , his parents took him and a friend out for the day , to adventure parks , hamburger restaurants , or the movies . 
Harry hated it there . 
" Now what ? " said Aunt Petunia , looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this . 
" We could phone Marge , " Uncle Vernon suggested . 
" Don't be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . " 
" What about what's - her - name , your friend -- Yvonne ? " 
" On vacation in Majorca , " snapped Aunt Petunia . 
" You could just leave me here , " Harry put in hopefully ( he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer ) . 
" I won't blow up the house , " said Harry , but they weren't listening . 
" I suppose we could take him to the zoo , " said Aunt Petunia slowly , " ... and leave him in the car .... " 
" That car's new , he's not sitting in it alone .... " 
Dudley began to cry loudly . 
In fact , he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed , his mother would give him anything he wanted . 
He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms . 
Just then , the doorbell rang -- " Oh , good Lord , they ' re here ! " said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later , Dudley's best friend , Piers Polkiss , walked in with his mother . 
Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat . 
Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once . 
Half an hour later , Harry , who couldn't believe his luck , was sitting in the back of the Dursleys ' car with Piers and Dudley , on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life . 
" I'm not going to do anything , " said Harry , " honestly .. 
But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him . 
No one ever did . 
Next morning , however , he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this , even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly . 
On the other hand , he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens . 
But all he'd tried to do ( as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard ) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors . 
But today , nothing was going to go wrong . 
It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school , his cupboard , or Mrs . Figg's cabbage - smelling living room . 
While he drove , Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia . 
He liked to complain about things : people at work , Harry , the council , Harry , the bank , and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects . 
This morning , it was motorcycles . 
" ... roaring along like maniacs , the young hoodlums , " he said , as a motorcycle overtook them . 
I had a dream about a motorcycle , " said Harry , remembering suddenly . 
" It was flying . " 
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front . 
He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry , his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache : " MOTORCYCLES DON ' T FLY ! " 
Dudley and Piers sniggered . 
I know they don't , " said Harry . 
" It was only a dream . " 
But he wished he hadn't said anything . 
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions , it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't , no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas . 
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families . 
The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then , because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away , they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop . 
Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time . 
They ate in the zoo restaurant , and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top , Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first . 
After lunch they went to the reptile house . 
Behind the glass , all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone . 
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge , poisonous cobras and thick , man - crushing pythons . 
Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place . 
It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood . 
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass , staring at the glistening brown coils . 
" Make it move , " he whined at his father . 
Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass , but the snake didn't budge . 
" Do it again , " Dudley ordered . 
Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles , but the snake just snoozed on . 
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake . 
It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom , where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up ; at least he got to visit the rest of the house . 
Slowly , very slowly , it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's . 
It winked . 
Harry stared . 
Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching . 
He looked back at the snake and winked , too . 
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley , then raised its eyes to the ceiling . 
It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly : 
" I get that all the time . 
" I know , " Harry murmured through the glass , though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him . 
" It must be really annoying . " 
The snake nodded vigorously . 
" Where do you come from , anyway ? " 
Harry asked . 
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass . 
Harry peered at it . 
Boa Constrictor , Brazil . 
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on : This specimen was bred in the zoo . 
" Oh , I see -- so you ' ve never been to Brazil ? " 
As the snake shook its head , a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump . 
DURSLEY ! 
" Out of the way , you , " he said , punching Harry in the ribs . 
What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second , Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass , the next , they had leapt back with howls of horror . 
Harry sat up and gasped ; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished . 
The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly , slithering out onto the floor . 
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits . 
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock . 
" But the glass , " he kept saying , " where did the glass go ? " 
Piers and Dudley could only gibber . 
As far as Harry had seen , the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed , but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car , Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg , while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death . 
But worst of all , for Harry at least , was Piers calming down enough to say , " Harry was talking to it , weren't you , Harry ? " 
He was so angry he could hardly speak . 
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later , wishing he had a watch . 
He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet . 
He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years , ten miserable years , as long as he could remember , ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash . 
He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died . 
Sometimes , when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard , he came up with a strange vision : a blinding flash of green light and a burn - ing pain on his forehead . 
This , he supposed , was the crash , though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from . 
There were no photographs of them in the house . 
Yet sometimes he thought ( or maybe hoped ) that strangers in the street seemed to know him . 
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley . 
After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man , Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything . 
A wild - looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus . 
A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word . 
The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look . 
At school , Harry had no one . 
Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses , and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang . 
CHAPTER THREE : THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE 
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest - ever punishment . 
By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again , the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera , crashed his remote control airplane , and , first time out on his racing bike , knocked down old Mrs . Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches . 
Harry was glad school was over , but there was no escaping Dudley's gang , who visited the house every single day . 
Piers , Dennis , Malcolm , and Gordon were all big and stupid , but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot , he was the leader . 
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house , wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays , where he could see a tiny ray of hope . 
When September came he would be going off to secondary school and , for the first time in his life , he wouldn't be with Dudley . 
Harry , on the other hand , was going to Stonewall High , the local public school . 
Dudley thought this was very funny . 
" They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall , " he told Harry . 
" No , thanks , " said Harry . 
Then he ran , before Dudley could work out what he'd said . 
One day in July , Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform , leaving Harry at Mrs . Figg's . 
It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats , and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before . 
She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years . 
That evening , Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand - new uniform . 
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers , Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life . 
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins , he looked so handsome and grown - up . 
He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh . 
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast . 
He went to have a look . 
" What's this ? " he asked Aunt Petunia . 
Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question . 
" Your new school uniform , " she said . 
Harry looked in the bowl again . 
" DotA be stupid , " snapped Aunt Petunia . 
" I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you . 
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in , both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform . 
Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick , which he carried everywhere , on the table . 
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat . 
" Make Harry get it . " 
" Get the mail , Harry . " 
" Make Dudley get it . " 
" Poke him with your Smelting stick , Dudley . " 
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail . 
Three things lay on the doormat : a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge , who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight , a brown envelope that looked like a bill , and -- a letter for Harry . 
Harry picked it up and stared at it , his heart twanging like a giant elastic band . 
No one , ever , in his whole life , had written to him . 
Who would ? 
He had no friends , no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library , so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back . 
Mr . H . 
Potter 
The Cupboard under the Stairs 
4 Privet Drive 
The envelope was thick and heavy , made of yellowish parchment , and the address was written in emerald - green ink . 
There was no stamp . 
Turning the envelope over , his hand trembling , Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms ; a lion , an eagle , a badger , and a snake surrounding a large letter H . 
" What are you doing , checking for letter bombs ? " 
Harry went back to the kitchen , still staring at his letter . 
He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard , sat down , and slowly began to open the yellow envelope . 
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill , snorted in disgust , and flipped over the postcard . 
" Marge's ill , " he informed Aunt Petunia . 
" Dad ! " said Dudley suddenly . 
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter , which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope , when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon . 
" Who'd be writing to you ? " sneered Uncle Vernon , shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it . 
His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights . 
Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge . 
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it , but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach . 
Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line . 
" Vernon ! Oh my goodness -- Vernon ! " 
They stared at each other , seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room . 
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick . 
" I want to read that letter , " he said loudly . 
want to read it , " said Harry furiously , " as it's mine . " 
Harry didn't move . 
" Let me see it ! " 
demanded Dudley . 
" OUT ! " roared Uncle Vernon , and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall , slamming the kitchen door behind them . 
Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole ; Dudley won , so Harry , his glasses dangling from one ear , lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor . 
" Vernon , " Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice , " look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps ? 
" But what should we do , Vernon ? 
Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen . 
" No , " he said finally . 
" But -- " 
" I'm not having one in the house , Petunia ! 
Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense ? " 
" Where's my letter ? " said Harry , the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door . 
" Who's writing to me ? " 
" No one . 
" I have burned it . " 
" It was not a mistake , " said Harry angrily , " it had my cupboard on it . " 
He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile , which looked quite painful . 
" Why ? " said Harry . 
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room . 
He sat down on the bed and stared around him . 
The month - old video camera was lying on top of a small , working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog ; in the corner was Dudley's first - ever television set , which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled ; there was a large birdcage , which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle , which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it . 
They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched . 
I need that room ... make him get out .... " 
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed . 
Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it . 
Dudley was in shock . 
He'd screamed , whacked his father with his Smelting stick , been sick on purpose , kicked his mother , and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof , and he still didn't have his room back . 
Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall . 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly . 
When the mail arrived , Uncle Vernon , who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry , made Dudley go and get it . 
They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall . 
Then he shouted , " There's another one ! 
' Mr . 
H . Potter , The Smallest Bedroom , 4 Privet Drive -- ' " 
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him , which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind . 
" Dudley -- go -- just go . " 
Harry walked round and round his new room . 
He had a plan . 
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o ' clock the next morning . 
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first . 
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door - 
Harry leapt into the air ; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive ! 
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big , squashy something had been his uncle's face . 
He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea . 
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back , the mail had arrived , right into Uncle Vernon's lap . 
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink . 
Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day . 
" I'm not sure that ' ll work , Vernon . " 
As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door , slotted through the sides , and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom . 
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again . 
After burning all the letters , he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out . 
He hummed " Tiptoe Through the Tulips " as he worked , and jumped at small noises . 
On Saturday , things began to get out of hand . 
Twenty - four letters to Harry found their way into the house , rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window . 
While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to , Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor . 
" Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly ? " 
Dudley asked Harry in amazement . 
On Sunday morning , Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill , but happy . 
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head . 
The Dursleys ducked , but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one . 
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall . 
They could hear the letters still streaming into the room , bouncing off the walls and floor . 
I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave . 
No arguments ! " 
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue . 
Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded - up doors and were in the car , speeding toward the highway . 
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat ; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television , VCR , and computer in his sports bag . 
They drove . 
And they drove . 
Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going . 
Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while . 
They didn't stop to eat or drink all day . 
By nightfall Dudley was howling . 
He'd never had such a bad day in his life . 
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy - looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city . 
Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp , musty sheets . 
Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake , sitting on the windowsill , staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering .... 
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day . 
They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table . 
Only I got about an ' undred of these at the front desk . " 
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address : 
Mr . H . 
Potter 
Room 17 
Cokeworth 
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way . 
The woman stared . 
Exactly what he was looking for , none of them knew . 
He drove them into the middle of a forest , got out , looked around , shook his head , got back in the car , and off they went again . 
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field , halfway across a suspension bridge , and at the top of a multilevel parking garage . 
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast , locked them all inside the car , and disappeared . 
It started to rain . 
Great drops beat on the roof of the car . 
I want to stay somewhere with a television . 
This reminded Harry of something . 
If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week , because of television -- then tomorrow , Tuesday , was Harry's eleventh birthday . 
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling . 
" Found the perfect place ! " he said . 
" Come on ! 
It was very cold outside the car . 
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine . 
One thing was certain , there was no television in there . 
" And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat ! " 
It was freezing in the boat . 
After what seemed like hours they reached the rock , where Uncle Vernon , slipping and sliding , led the way to the broken - down house . 
The inside was horrible ; it smelled strongly of seaweed , the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls , and the fireplace was damp and empty . 
He was in a very good mood . 
Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail . 
Harry privately agreed , though the thought didn't cheer him up at all . 
As night fell , the promised storm blew up around them . 
Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows . 
Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth - eaten sofa . 
She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door , and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest , most ragged blanket . 
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on . 
Harry couldn't sleep . 
The lighted dial of Dudley's watch , which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist , told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes ' time . 
He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer , wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all , wondering where the letter writer was now . 
Five minutes to go . 
Four minutes to go . 
Three minutes to go . 
Was that the sea , slapping hard on the rock like that ? 
And ( two minutes to go ) what was that funny crunching noise ? 
Was the rock crumbling into the sea ? 
BOOM . 
CHAPTER FOUR : THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
BOOM . 
He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long , thin package he had brought with them . 
" Who's there ? " he shouted . 
" I warn you -- I'm armed ! " 
There was a pause . 
Then - 
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor . 
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway . 
His face was almost completely hidden by a long , shaggy mane of hair and a wild , tangled beard , but you could make out his eyes , glinting like black beetles under all the hair . 
The giant squeezed his way into the hut , stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling . 
He bent down , picked up the door , and fitted it easily back into its frame . 
He turned to look at them all . 
It's not been an easy journey ... " 
" An ' here's Harry ! " said the giant . 
Harry looked up into the fierce , wild , shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile . 
" Las ' time I saw you , you was only a baby , " said the giant . 
" Ah , shut up , Dursley , yeh great prune , " said the giant ; he reached over the back of the sofa , jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands , bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber , and threw it into a corner of the room . 
" Anyway -- Harry , " said the giant , turning his back on the Dursleys , " a very happy birthday to yeh . 
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box . 
Harry opened it with trembling fingers . 
Inside was a large , sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing . 
Harry looked up at the giant . 
He meant to say thank you , but the words got lost on the way to his mouth , and what he said instead was , " Who are you ? " 
The giant chuckled . 
Rubeus Hagrid , Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts . " 
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm . 
" What about that tea then , eh ? " he said , rubbing his hands together . 
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted . 
He bent down over the fireplace ; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later , there was a roaring fire there . 
The giant sat back down on the sofa , which sagged under his weight , and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat : a copper kettle , a squashy package of sausages , a poker , a teapot , several chipped mugs , and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea . 
Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage . 
Nobody said a thing while the giant was working , but as he slid the first six fat , juicy , slightly burnt sausages from the poker , Dudley fidgeted a little . 
Uncle Vernon said sharply , " Don't touch anything he gives you , Dudley . " 
The giant chuckled darkly . 
He passed the sausages to Harry , who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful , but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant . 
Finally , as nobody seemed about to explain anything , he said , " I'm sorry , but I still don't really know who you are . " 
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . 
" Call me Hagrid , " he said , " everyone does . 
An ' like I told yeh , I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh ' ll know all about Hogwarts , o ' course . 
" Er -- no , " said Harry . 
Hagrid looked shocked . 
" Sorry , " Harry said quickly . 
" Sony ? " barked Hagrid , turning to stare at the Dursleys , who shrank back into the shadows . 
" All what ? " asked Harry . 
" ALL WHAT ? " Hagrid thundered . 
He had leapt to his feet . 
In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut . 
He had been to school , after all , and his marks weren't bad . 
" I know some things , " he said . 
" I can , you know , do math and stuff . " 
Your world . 
My world . 
Yer parents ' world . " 
" What world ? " 
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode . 
" DURSLEY ! " he boomed . 
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry . 
" I mean , they ' re famous . 
You ' re famous . " 
" What ? 
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice . 
" Stop ! " he commanded . 
" Stop right there , sit ! 
I forbid you to tell the boy anything ! " 
Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him ? 
I was there ! 
I saw Dumbledore leave it , Dursley ! 
" Kept what from me ? " said Harry eagerly . 
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror . 
" Harry -- yet a wizard . " 
There was silence inside the hut . 
Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard . 
" -- a what ? " gasped Harry . 
An ' I reckon it's abou ' time yeh read yer letter . " 
Potter , The Floor , Hut - on - the - Rock , The Sea . 
He pulled out the letter and read : 
Dear Mr . Potter , 
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment . 
Term begins on September 1 . 
Minerva McGonagall , 
" Gallopin ' Gorgons , that reminds me , " said Hagrid , clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse , and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real , live , rather ruffled - looking owl -- a long quill , and a roll of parchment . 
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down : 
Dear Professor Dumbledore , 
Given Harry his letter . 
Hagrid 
Hagrid rolled up the note , gave it to the owl , which clamped it in its beak , went to the door , and threw the owl out into the storm . 
Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone . 
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly . 
" He's not going , " he said . 
Hagrid grunted . 
" A what ? " said Harry , interested . 
" You knew ? " said Harry . 
" You knew I'm a -- a wizard ? " 
" Knew ! " shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly . 
Of course we knew ! 
Oh , she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn , turning teacups into rats . 
I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak ! 
But for my mother and father , oh no , it was Lily this and Lily that , they were proud of having a witch in the family ! " 
It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years . 
" Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you , and of course I knew you'd be just the same , just as strange , just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then , if you please , she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you ! " 
As soon as he found his voice he said , " Blown up ? 
" CAR CRASH ! " roared Hagrid , jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner . 
It's an outrage ! 
A scandal ! 
Harry Potter not knowin ' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name ! " " But why ? 
What happened ? " 
Harry asked urgently . 
The anger faded from Hagrid's face . 
" I never expected this , " he said , in a low , worried voice . 
Ah , Harry , I don ' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin ' . " 
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys . 
" Well , it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind , I can't tell yeh everythin ' , it's a great myst ' ry , parts of it .... " 
He sat down , stared into the fire for a few seconds , and then said , " It begins , I suppose , with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name , everyone in our world knows -- " 
" Who ? " 
" Well -- I don ' like sayin'the name if I can help it . 
No one does . " 
" Why not ? " 
" Gulpin ' gargoyles , Harry , people are still scared . 
Blimey , this is difficult . 
His name was ... " 
" Could you write it down ? " 
Harry suggested . 
All right -- Voldemort . 
" Hagrid shuddered . 
" Don ' make me say it again . 
Dark days , Harry . 
He was takin ' over . 
" Maybe he thought he could persuade ' em ... maybe he just wanted ' em outta the way . 
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty , spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn . 
" Sorry , " he said . 
An'then -- an'this is the real myst ' ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you , too . 
No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ' em , no one except you , an ' he'd killed some o ' the best witches an ' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons , the Bones , the Prewetts -- an ' you was only a baby , an ' you lived . " 
Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind . 
As Hagrid's story came to a close , he saw again the blinding flash of green light , more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else , for the first time in his life : a high , cold , cruel laugh . 
" Took yeh from the ruined house myself , on Dumbledore's orders . 
He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched . 
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword , he said , " I'm warning you , Dursley - I'm warning you -- one more word ... " 
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant , Uncle Vernon's courage failed again ; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent . 
" Good question , Harry . 
Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . 
" Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers . 
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes , but Harry , instead of feeling pleased and proud , felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake . 
A wizard ? Him ? 
If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world , how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football ? 
" Hagrid , " he said quietly , " I think you must have made a mistake . 
I don't think I can be a wizard . " 
" Not a wizard , eh ? 
Never made things happen when you was scared or angry ? " 
Harry looked into the fire . 
Now he came to think about it ... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he , Harry , had been upset or angry ... chased by Dudley's gang , he had somehow found himself out of their reach ... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut , he'd managed to make it grow back ... and the very last time Dudley had hit him , hadn't he got his revenge , without even realizing he was doing it ? 
Harry looked back at Hagrid , smiling , and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him . 
" See ? " said Hagrid . 
" Harry Potter , not a wizard -- you wait , you ' ll be right famous at Hogwarts . " 
" Haven't I told you he's not going ? " he hissed . 
I ' ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and -- " 
" If he wants ter go , a great Muggle like you won't stop him , " growled Hagrid . 
He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world . 
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light , a sound like a firecracker , a sharp squeal , and the next second , Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom , howling in pain . 
When he turned his back on them , Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers . 
Uncle Vernon roared . 
Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room , he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them . 
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard . 
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows . 
" I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic , strictly speakin ' . 
" Why aren't you supposed to do magic ? " 
asked Harry . 
" Oh , well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled , ter tell yeh the truth . 
In me third year . 
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry . 
Harry woke early the next morning . 
Although he could tell it was daylight , he kept his eyes shut tight . 
" I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards . 
When I open my eyes I ' ll be at home in my cupboard . " 
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise . 
And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door , Harry thought , his heart sinking . 
But he still didn't open his eyes . 
It had been such a good dream . 
" All right , " Harry mumbled , " I'm getting up . " 
He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him . 
The hut was full of sunlight , the storm was over , Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa , and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window , a newspaper held in its beak . 
He went straight to the window and jerked it open . 
The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid , who didn't wake up . 
The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat . 
" Don't do that . " 
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way , but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat . 
" Hagrid ! " said Harry loudly . 
" There's an owl 
" What ? " 
Look in the pockets . " 
Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys , slug pellets , balls of string , peppermint humbugs , teabags ... finally , Harry pulled out a handful of strange - looking coins . 
" Give him five Knuts , " said Hagrid sleepily . 
" The little bronze ones . " 
Harry counted out five little bronze coins , and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it . 
Then he flew off through the open window . 
Hagrid yawned loudly , sat up , and stretched . 
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them . 
He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture . 
" Um -- Hagrid ? " 
" Don't worry about that , " said Hagrid , standing up and scratching his head . 
" But if their house was destroyed -- " 
" Wizards have banks ? " 
" Just the one . 
Gringotts . 
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding . 
Never mess with goblins , Harry . 
Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- ' cept maybe Hogwarts . 
Fer Dumbledore . 
Hogwarts business . " 
Come on , then . " 
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock . 
The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight . 
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there , with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm . 
" How did you get here ? " 
Harry asked , looking around for another boat . 
" Flew , " said Hagrid . 
They settled down in the boat , Harry still staring at Hagrid , trying to imagine him flying . 
" Of course not , " said Harry , eager to see more magic . 
Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again , tapped it twice on the side of the boat , and they sped off toward land . 
Harry asked . 
Deep under the Underground . 
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper , the Daily Prophet . 
" There's a Ministry of Magic ? " 
Harry asked , before he could stop himself . 
" ' Course , " said Hagrid . 
" But what does a Ministry of Magic do ? " 
" Well , their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an ' wizards up an'down the country . " 
" Why ? " 
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall . 
Hagrid folded up his newspaper , and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street . 
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station . 
Harry couldn't blame them . 
" Hagrid , " said Harry , panting a bit as he ran to keep up , " did you say there are dragons at Gringotts ? " 
" Well , so they say , " said Hagrid . 
" Crikey , I'd like a dragon . " 
They had reached the station . 
There was a train to London in five minutes ' time . 
Hagrid , who didn't understand " Muggle money , " as he called it , gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets . 
People stared more than ever on the train . 
Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary - yellow circus tent . 
" Still got yer letter , Harry ? " he asked as he counted stitches . 
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket . 
" Good , " said Hagrid . 
" There's a list there of everything yeh need . " 
First - year students will require : 
4 . One winter cloak ( black , silver fastenings ) 
All students should have a copy of each of the following : 
The Standard Book of Spells ( Grade 1 ) by Miranda Goshawk 
A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot 
Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling 
OTHER EQUIPMENT 
wand cauldron ( pewter , standard size 2 ) set 
telescope set 
Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad 
" Can we buy all this in London ? " 
Harry wondered aloud . 
" If yeh know where to go , " said Hagrid . 
Harry had never been to London before . 
Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going , he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way . 
He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground , and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow . 
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily ; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him . 
It's a famous place . " 
It was a tiny , grubby - looking pub . 
Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all . 
In fact , Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it . 
For a famous place , it was very dark and shabby . 
A few old women were sitting in a corner , drinking tiny glasses of sherry . 
A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender , who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut . 
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid ; they waved and smiled at him , and the bartender reached for a glass , saying , " The usual , Hagrid ? " 
" Can't , Tom , I'm on Hogwarts business , " said Hagrid , clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle . 
" Good Lord , " said the bartender , peering at Harry , " is this -- can this be -- ? " 
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent . 
He hurried out from behind the bar , rushed toward Harry and seized his hand , tears in his eyes . 
Harry didn't know what to say . 
Everyone was looking at him . 
The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out . 
Hagrid was beaming . 
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment , Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron . 
" So proud , Mr . Potter , I'm just so proud . " 
" Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter . " 
" He remembers ! " 
" Did you hear that ? 
One of his eyes was twitching . 
" Professor Quirrell ! " said Hagrid . 
" Harry , Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts . " 
" What sort of magic do you teach , Professor Quirrell ? " 
" N - not that you n - need it , eh , P - P - Potter ? " 
He looked terrified at the very thought . 
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself . 
Come on , Harry . " 
Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time , and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small , walled courtyard , where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds . 
Hagrid grinned at Harry . 
" Is he always that nervous ? " 
" Oh , yeah . 
Poor bloke . 
Harry's head was swimming . 
Hagrid , meanwhile , was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can . 
" Right , stand back , Harry . " 
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella . 
" Welcome , " said Hagrid , " to Diagon Alley . " 
He grinned at Harry's amazement . 
Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall . 
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop . 
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes . 
He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street , trying to look at everything at once : the shops , the things outside them , the people doing their shopping . 
A low , soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny , Screech , Barn , Brown , and Snowy . 
" Look , " Harry heard one of them say , " the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever -- " There were shops selling robes , shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before , windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels ' eyes , tottering piles of spell books , quills , and rolls of parchment , potion bottles , globes of the moon .... 
" Gringotts , " said Hagrid . 
" Yeah , that's a goblin , " said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him . 
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry . 
He had a swarthy , clever face , a pointed beard and , Harry noticed , very long fingers and feet . 
Of what awaits the sin of greed , 
For those who take , but do not earn , 
So if you seek beneath our floors 
" Like I said , Yeh'd be mad ter try an ' rob it , " said Hagrid . 
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall , and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these . 
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter . 
" Morning , " said Hagrid to a free goblin . 
" We ' ve come ter take some money outta Mr . Harry Potter's safe . " 
" Got it here somewhere , " said Hagrid , and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter , scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers . 
The goblin wrinkled his nose . 
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals . 
The goblin looked at it closely . 
" That seems to be in order . " 
" An ' I ' ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore , " said Hagrid importantly , throwing out his chest . 
" It's about the YouKnow - What in vault seven hundred and thirteen . " 
The goblin read the letter carefully . 
Griphook ! " 
Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets , he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall . 
" What's the You - Know - What in vault seven hundred and thirteen ? " 
Harry asked . 
" Can't tell yeh that , " said Hagrid mysteriously . 
" Very secret . 
Hogwarts business . 
Dumbledore's trusted me . 
Griphook held the door open for them . 
Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them . 
Harry tried to remember , left , right , right , left , middle fork , right , left , but it was impossible . 
Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them , but he kept them wide open . 
Once , he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon , but too late - they plunged even deeper , passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor . 
I never know , " Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart , " what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite ? " 
" Stalagmite's got an ' m ' in it , " said Hagrid . 
" An'don ' ask me questions just now , I think I'm gonna be sick . " 
He did look very green , and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall , Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling . 
Griphook unlocked the door . 
A lot of green smoke came billowing out , and as it cleared , Harry gasped . 
Columns of silver . 
Heaps of little bronze Knuts . 
" All yours , " smiled Hagrid . 
All Harry's -- it was incredible . 
How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep ? 
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag . 
He turned to Griphook . 
" Vault seven hundred and thirteen now , please , and can we go more slowly ? " 
They went rattling over an underground ravine , and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom , but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck . 
He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away . 
" If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that , they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there , " said Griphook . 
" How often do you check to see if anyone's inside ? " 
Harry asked . 
" About once every ten years , " said Griphook with a rather nasty grin . 
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault , Harry was sure , and he leaned forward eagerly , expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty . 
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor . 
Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat . 
Harry longed to know what it was , but knew better than to ask . 
" Come on , back in this infernal cart , and don't talk to me on the way back , it's best if I keep me mouth shut , " said Hagrid . 
Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money . 
Madam Malkin was a squat , smiling witch dressed all in mauve . 
" Hogwarts , clear ? " she said , when Harry started to speak . 
In the back of the shop , a boy with a pale , pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes . 
Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him ) slipped a long robe over his head , and began to pin it to the right length . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands , " said the boy . 
He had a bored , drawling voice . 
I think I ' ll bully father into getting me one and I ' ll smuggle it in somehow . " 
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley . 
" No , " said Harry . 
" I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house , and I must say , I agree . 
" No , " said Harry , feeling more stupid by the minute . 
" Well , no one really knows until they get there , do they , but I know I ' ll be in Slytherin , all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff , I think I'd leave , wouldn't you ? " " Mmm , " said Harry , wishing he could say something a bit more interesting . 
" I say , look at that man ! " said the boy suddenly , nodding toward the front window . 
Hagrid was standing there , grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in . 
" He works at Hogwarts . " 
" Oh , " said the boy , " I ' ve heard of him . 
" He's the gamekeeper , " said Harry . 
" Yes , exactly . 
I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk , tries to do magic , and ends up setting fire to his bed . " 
" I think he's brilliant , " said Harry coldly . 
" Do you ? " said the boy , with a slight sneer . 
" Why is he with you ? 
Where are your parents ? " 
" They're dead , " said Harry shortly . 
" Oh , sorry , " said the other , . 
" They were a witch and wizard , if that's what you mean . " 
I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families . 
What's your surname , anyway ? " 
" Well , I ' ll see you at Hogwarts , I suppose , " said the drawling boy . 
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him ( chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts ) . 
" What's up ? " said Hagrid . 
" Nothing , " Harry lied . 
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote . 
When they had left the shop , he said , " Hagrid , what's Quidditch ? " 
" Don't make me feel worse , " said Harry . 
He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin's . 
" Yer not from a Muggle family . 
You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh . 
" So what is Quidditch ? " 
" It's our sport . 
It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules . " 
" And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff ? " 
There's four . 
Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'duffers , but -- " 
" I bet I'm in Hufflepuff " said Harry gloomily . 
" Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin , " said Hagrid darkly . 
" Years an ' years ago , " said Hagrid . 
They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather ; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk ; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all . 
" I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley . " 
" I'm not sayin'that's not a good idea , but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances , " said Hagrid . 
Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron , either ( " It says pewter on yer list " ) , but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope . 
Then they visited the Apothecary , which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell , a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages . 
Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor ; jars of herbs , dried roots , and bright powders lined the walls ; bundles of feathers , strings of fangs , and snarled claws hung from the ceiling . 
While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry , Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty - one Galleons each and minuscule , glittery - black beetle eyes ( five Knuts a scoop ) . 
Outside the Apothecary , Hagrid checked Harry's list again . 
Harry felt himself go red . 
" You don't have to -- " 
" I know I don't have to . 
I ' ll get yer an owl . 
" Don ' mention it , " said Hagrid gruffly . 
A magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to . 
A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window . 
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside . 
It was a tiny place , empty except for a single , spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait . 
Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library ; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling . 
For some reason , the back of his neck prickled . 
" Good afternoon , " said a soft voice . 
Harry jumped . 
An old man was standing before them , his wide , pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop . 
" Hello , " said Harry awkwardly . 
" Ah yes , " said the man . 
" Yes , yes . 
I thought I'd be seeing you soon . 
Harry Potter . " 
" You have your mother's eyes . 
Harry wished he would blink . 
" Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wand . 
Well , I say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard , of course . " 
Mr . Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose . 
Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes . 
" And that's where ... " 
Mr . Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long , white finger . 
" I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it , " he said softly . 
" Thirteen - and - a - half inches . 
Powerful wand , very powerful , and in the wrong hands ... well , if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do .... " 
He shook his head and then , to Harry's relief , spotted Hagrid . 
" Rubeus ! Rubeus Hagrid ! 
" It was , sir , yes , " said Hagrid . 
" Good wand , that one . 
" Er -- yes , they did , yes , " said Hagrid , shuffling his feet . 
" But you don't use them ? " said Mr . Ollivander sharply . 
" Oh , no , sit , " said Hagrid quickly . 
" Hmmm , " said Mr . Ollivander , giving Hagrid a piercing look . 
" Well , now -- Mr . Potter . 
Let me see . " 
" Er -- well , I'm right - handed , " said Harry . 
That's it . " 
He measured Harry from shoulder to finger , then wrist to elbow , shoulder to floor , knee to armpit and round his head . 
As he measured , he said , " Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance , Mr . Potter . 
We use unicorn hairs , phoenix tail feathers , and the heartstrings of dragons . 
No two Ollivander wands are the same , just as no two unicorns , dragons , or phoenixes are quite the same . 
" That will do , " he said , and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor . 
" Right then , Mr . Potter . 
Try this one . 
Beechwood and dragon heartstring . 
Nice and flexible . 
just take it and give it a wave . " 
" Maple and phoenix feather . 
Try -- " 
" No , no - here , ebony and unicorn hair , eight and a half inches , springy . 
Go on , go on , try it out . " 
Harry tried . 
And tried . 
The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair , but the more wands Mr . Ollivander pulled from the shelves , the happier he seemed to become . 
Harry took the wand . 
He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers . 
He raised the wand above his head , brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework , throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls . 
He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper , still muttering , " Curious ... curious .. 
" Sorry , " said Harry , " but what's curious ? " 
" I remember every wand I ' ve ever sold , Mr . Potter . 
It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather -- just one other . 
Harry swallowed . 
" Yes , thirteen - and - a - half inches . 
I think we must expect great things from you , Mr . Potter .... 
Harry shivered . 
He wasn't sure he liked Mr . Ollivander too much . 
He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand , and Mr . Ollivander bowed them from his shop . 
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley , back through the wall , back through the Leaky Cauldron , now empty . 
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them . 
Harry kept looking around . 
" You all right , Harry ? 
Yer very quiet , " said Hagrid . 
Harry wasn't sure he could explain . 
He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger , trying to find the words . 
" Everyone thinks I'm special , " he said at last . 
" All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr . Ollivander ... but I don't know anything about magic at all . 
How can they expect great things ? 
I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for . 
I don't know what happened when Vol - , sorry -- I mean , the night my parents died . " 
Hagrid leaned across the table . 
" Don ' you worry , Harry . 
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you ' ll be just fine . 
I know it's hard . 
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys , then handed him an envelope . 
" Yer ticket fer Hogwarts , " he said . 
" First o ' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket . 
The train pulled out of the station . 
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight ; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window , but he blinked and Hagrid had gone . 
Harry kept to his room , with his new owl for company . 
He had decided to call her Hedwig , a name he had found in A History of Magic . 
He lay on his bed reading late into the night , Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased . 
Every night before he went to sleep , Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall , counting down to September the first . 
On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day , so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television . 
" Er -- Uncle Vernon ? " 
" Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts . " 
Uncle Vernon grunted again . 
Harry supposed that meant yes . 
" Thank you . " 
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke . 
" Funny way to get to a wizards'school , the train . 
Harry didn't say anything . 
" Where is this school , anyway ? " 
" I don't know , " said Harry , realizing this for the first time . 
He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket . 
" I just take the train from platform nine and three - quarters at eleven o ' clock , " he read . 
His aunt and uncle stared . 
" Platform what ? " 
" It's on my ticket . " 
All right , we ' ll take you to King's Cross . 
" Why are you going to London ? " 
Harry asked , trying to keep things friendly . 
" Taking Dudley to the hospital , " growled Uncle Vernon . 
" Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . " 
Harry woke at five o ' clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep . 
He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train . 
He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed , saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage , and then paced the room , waiting for the Dursleys to get up . 
They reached King's Cross at half past ten . 
Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him . 
" Well , there you are , boy . 
Platform nine -- platform ten . 
He was quite right , of course . 
There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it , and in the middle , nothing at all . 
He left without another word . 
Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away . 
All three of them were laughing . 
Harry's mouth went rather dry . 
What on earth was he going to do ? 
The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in , he started to get annoyed , as though Harry was being stupid on purpose . 
Getting desperate , Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o ' clock , but the guard said there wasn't one . 
In the end the guard strode away , muttering about time wasters . 
Harry was now trying hard not to panic . 
According to the large clock over the arrivals board , he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it ; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift , a pocket full of wizard money , and a large owl . 
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do , like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley . 
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying . 
Harry swung round . 
The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys , all with flaming red hair . 
Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl . 
They stopped and so did he , just near enough to hear what they were saying . 
" Now , what's the platform number ? " said the boys ' mother . 
All right , Percy , you go first . " 
Harry watched , careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms , a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away , the boy had vanished . 
" Fred , you next , " the plump woman said . 
" I'm not Fred , I'm George , " said the boy . 
CarA you tell I'm George ? " 
" Sorry , George , dear . " 
" Only joking , I am Fred , " said the boy , and off he went . 
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then , quite suddenly , he wasn't anywhere . 
There was nothing else for it . 
" Excuse me , " Harry said to the plump woman . 
" Hello , dear , " she said . 
" First time at Hogwarts ? 
Ron's new , too . " 
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons . 
He was tall , thin , and gangling , with freckles , big hands and feet , and a long nose . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" The thing is -- the thing is , I don't know how to -- " 
" How to get onto the platform ? " 
she said kindly , and Harry nodded . 
" All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten . 
Best do it at a bit of a run if you ' re nervous . 
Go on , go now before Ron . " 
" Er -- okay , " said Harry . 
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier . 
It looked very solid . 
Harry walked more quickly . 
He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart , he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash - 
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people . 
Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought - iron archway where the barrier had been , with the words Platform Nine and Three - Quarters on it , He had done it . 
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd , while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs . 
Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks . 
The first few carriages were already packed with students , some hanging out of the window to talk to their families , some fighting over seats . 
" Oh , Neville , " he heard the old woman sigh . 
" Give us a look , Lee , go on . " 
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms , and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long , hairy leg . 
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train . 
He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door . 
He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot . 
" Want a hand ? " 
It was one of the red - haired twins he'd followed through the barrier . 
" Yes , please , " Harry panted . 
With the twins ' help , Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment . 
" Thanks , " said Harry , pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes . 
" What's that ? " said one of the twins suddenly , pointing at Harry's lightning scar . 
" Blimey , " said the other twin . 
" Are you 
" He is , " said the first twin . 
" Aren't you ? " he added to Harry . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" Harry Potter , " chorused the twins . 
" Oh , him , " said Harry . 
" I mean , yes , I am . " 
The two boys gawked at him , and Harry felt himself turning red . 
" Fred ? 
George ? 
Are you there ? " 
" Coming , Mom . " 
With a last look at Harry , the twins hopped off the train . 
Harry sat down next to the window where , half hidden , he could watch the red - haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying . 
" Ron , you ' ve got something on your nose . " 
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way , but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose . 
" Shut up , " said Ron . 
" Where's Percy ? " said their mother . 
" He's coming now . " 
He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes , and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it . 
" Oh , are you a prefect , Percy ? " said one of the twins , with an air of great surprise . 
" You should have said something , we had no idea . " 
" Hang on , I think I remember him saying something about it , " said the other twin . 
" Or twice -- " 
" A minute -- " 
Then she turned to the twins . 
" Now , you two -- this year , you behave yourselves . 
" Blown up a toilet ? 
" It's not funny . 
And look after Ron . " 
" Shut up , " said Ron again . 
He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it . 
Guess who we just met on the train ? " 
" You know that black - haired boy who was near us in the station ? 
Know who he is ? " 
" Who ? " 
" Harry Potter ! " 
Harry heard the little girl's voice . 
Is he really , Fred ? 
How do you know ? " 
" Asked him . 
It's really there - like lightning . " 
Their mother suddenly became very stern . 
" I forbid you to ask him , Fred . 
No , don't you dare . 
As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . " 
" All right , keep your hair on . " 
A whistle sounded . 
" Hurry up ! " their mother said , and the three boys clambered onto the train . 
They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good - bye , and their younger sister began to cry . 
" We ' ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat . " 
" George ! " 
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner . 
He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind . 
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in . 
" Anyone sitting there ? " he asked , pointing at the seat opposite Harry . 
" Everywhere else is full . " 
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down . 
He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window , pretending he hadn't looked . 
" Hey , Ron . " 
" Listen , we ' re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there . " 
" Right , " mumbled Ron . 
" Harry , " said the other twin , " did we introduce ourselves ? 
Fred and George Weasley . 
And this is Ron , our brother . 
See you later , then . 
" Bye , " said Harry and Ron . 
" Are you really Harry Potter ? " Ron blurted out . 
Harry nodded . 
He pointed at Harry's forehead . 
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar . 
Ron stared . 
" So that's where You - Know - Who 
" Yes , " said Harry , " but I can't remember it . " 
" Nothing ? " said Ron eagerly . 
" Wow , " said Ron . 
He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments , then , as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing , he looked quickly out of the window again . 
asked Harry , who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him . 
" Er -- Yes , I think so , " said Ron . " I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant , but we never talk about him . " 
" So you must know loads of magic already . " 
" I heard you went to live with Muggles , " said Ron . " What are they like ? " 
" Horrible - well , not all of them . 
My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though . 
Wish I'd had three wizard brothers . " 
" Five , " said Ron . 
For some reason , he was looking gloomy . 
" I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts . 
You could say I ' ve got a lot to live up to . 
Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch . 
Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they ' re really funny . 
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it's no big deal , because they did it first . 
I ' ve got Bill's old robes , Charlie's old wand , and Percy's old rat . " 
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat , which was asleep . 
" His name's Scabbers and he's useless , he hardly ever wakes up . 
Ron's ears went pink . 
After all , he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago , and he told Ron so , all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents . 
" ... and until Hagrid told me , I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort " 
Ron gasped . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" You said You - Know - Who's name ! " said Ron , sounding both shocked and impressed . 
" I'd have thought you , of all people -- " 
" I'm not trying to be brave or anything , saying the name , " said Harry , I just never knew you shouldn't . 
See what I mean ? 
I ' ve got loads to learn .... 
I bet , " he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , " I bet I'm the worst in the class . " 
While they had been talking , the train had carried them out of London . 
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep . 
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling , dimpled woman slid back their door and said , " Anything off the cart , dears ? " 
Harry went out into the corridor . 
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys , and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars . 
Pumpkin Pasties , Cauldron Cakes , Licorice Wands , and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life . 
Not wanting to miss anything , he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts . 
" Hungry , are you ? " 
" Starving , " said Harry , taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty . 
" Go on -- " 
" Go on , have a pasty , " said Harry , who had never had anything to share before or , indeed , anyone to share it with . 
It was a nice feeling , sitting there with Ron , eating their way through all Harry's pasties , cakes , and candies ( the sandwiches lay forgotten ) . 
" What are these ? " 
Harry asked Ron , holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs . 
" They're not really frogs , are they ? " 
" No , " said Ron . " But see what the card is . 
I'm missing Agrippa . " 
" What ? " 
" Oh , of course , you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect -- famous witches and wizards . 
I ' ve got about five hundred , but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy . " 
It showed a man's face . 
Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore . 
" So this is Dumbledore ! " said Harry . 
" Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore ! " said Ron . " Can I have a frog ? 
Harry turned over his card and read : 
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times , Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel . 
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling . 
" He's gone ! " 
No , I ' ve got Morgana again and I ' ve got about six of her ... do you want it ? 
You can start collecting . " 
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped . 
" Help yourself , " said Harry . 
" But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . " 
" Do they ? 
" weird ! " 
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile . 
Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards , but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them . 
Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana , but Hengist of Woodcroft , Alberic Grunnion , Circe , Paracelsus , and Merlin . 
" You want to be careful with those , " Ron warned Harry . 
Ron picked up a green bean , looked at it carefully , and bit into a corner . 
Now there were woods , twisting rivers , and dark green hills . 
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round - faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in . 
He looked tearful . 
" He ' ll turn up , " said Harry . 
" Well , if you see him ... " 
He left . 
" Don't know why he's so bothered , " said Ron . " If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could . 
Mind you , I brought Scabbers , so I can't talk . " 
The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap . 
" I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting , but the spell didn't work . 
I ' ll show you , look ... " 
It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end . 
" Unicorn hair's nearly poking out . 
He had just raised his ' wand when the compartment door slid open again . 
The toadless boy was back , but this time he had a girl with him . 
" Has anyone seen a toad ? 
" Oh , are you doing magic ? 
Let's see it , then . " 
She sat down . 
Ron looked taken aback . 
" Er -- all right . " 
He cleared his throat . 
He waved his wand , but nothing happened . 
" Are you sure that's a real spell ? " said the girl . 
" Well , it's not very good , is it ? 
Nobody in my family's magic at all , it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter , but I was ever so pleased , of course , I mean , it's the very best school of witchcraft there is , I ' ve heard - I ' ve learned all our course books by heart , of course , I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger , by the way , who are you . 
She said all this very fast . 
" I'm Ron Weasley , " Ron muttered . 
" Harry Potter , " said Harry . 
" Are you really ? " said Hermione . 
" I know all about you , of course -- I got a few extra books . 
for background reading , and you ' re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century . 
" Am I ? " said Harry , feeling dazed . 
" Goodness , didn't you know , I'd have found out everything I could if it was me , " said Hermione . 
" Do either of you know what house you ' ll be in ? 
I ' ve been asking around , and I hope I'm in Gryffindor , it sounds by far the best ; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it , but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad .... Anyway , we'd better go and look for Neville's toad . 
" Whatever house I'm in , I hope she's not in it , " said Ron . 
He threw his wand back into his trunk . 
" Stupid spell -- George gave it to me , bet he knew it was a dud . " 
" What house are your brothers in ? " asked Harry . 
" Gryffindor , " said Ron . Gloom seemed to be settling on him again . 
I don't know what they ' ll say if I'm not . 
" Yeah , " said Ron . 
" So what do your oldest brothers do now that they ' ve left , anyway ? " 
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school . 
Gringotts ? 
Harry stared . 
" Really ? 
What happened to them ? " 
" Nothing , that's why it's such big news . 
" What's your Quidditch team ? " Ron asked . 
" Er -- I don't know any , " Harry confessed . 
" What ! " Ron looked dumbfounded . 
" Oh , you wait , it's the best game in the world -- " And he was off , explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players , describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money . 
He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again , but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy , or Hermione Granger this time . 
Three boys entered , and Harry recognized the middle one at once : it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop . 
" Is it true ? " he said . 
" They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment . 
So it's you , is it ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
He was looking at the other boys . 
Standing on either side of the pale boy , they looked like bodyguards . 
" Oh , this is Crabbe and this is Goyle , " said the pale boy carelessly , noticing where Harry was looking . 
" And my name's Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . " 
Draco Malfoy looked at him . 
" Think my name's funny , do you ? 
No need to ask who you are . 
He turned back to Harry . 
I can help you there . " 
He held out his hand to shake Harry's , but Harry didn't take it . 
" I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself , thanks , " he said coolly . 
" I'd be careful if I were you , Potter , " he said slowly . 
" Unless you ' re a bit politer you ' ll go the same way as your parents . 
They didn't know what was good for them , either . 
Both Harry and Ron stood up . 
" Say that again , " Ron said , his face as red as his hair . 
" Oh , you ' re going to fight us , are you ? " 
Malfoy sneered . 
" Unless you get out now , " said Harry , more bravely than he felt , because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron . 
We ' ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some . " 
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward , but before he'd so much as touched Goyle , Goyle let out a horrible yell . 
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger , sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round , howling , and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window , all three of them disappeared at once . 
" What has been going on ? " she said , looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail . 
I think he's been knocked out , " Ron said to Harry . 
He looked closer at Scabbers . 
And so he had . 
" I ' ve heard of his family , " said Ron darkly . 
" They were some of the first to come back to our side after You - Know - Who disappeared . 
My dad doesn't believe it . 
He turned to Hermione . 
" You'd better hurry up and put your robes on , I ' ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor , and he says we ' re nearly there . 
" And you ' ve got dirt on your nose , by the way , did you know ? " 
Ron glared at her as she left . 
Harry peered out of the window . 
It was getting dark . 
He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky . 
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes . 
A voice echoed through the train : " We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes ' time . 
Please leave your luggage on the train , it will be taken to the school separately . " 
They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor . 
The train slowed right down and finally stopped . 
People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny , dark platform . 
Harry shivered in the cold night air . 
Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students , and Harry heard a familiar voice : " Firs ' years ! 
All right there , Harry ? " 
Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads . 
Firs ' years follow me ! " 
Slipping and stumbling , they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep , narrow path . 
It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there . 
There was a loud " Oooooh ! " 
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take . 
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side , its windows sparkling in the starry sky , was a vast castle with many turrets and towers . 
" No more ' n four to a boat ! " Hagrid called , pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore . 
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione . 
" Right then -- FORWARD ! " 
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once , gliding across the lake , which was as smooth as glass . 
Everyone was silent , staring up at the great castle overhead . 
" Heads down ! " yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff ; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face . 
Is this your toad ? " said Hagrid , who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them . 
" Trevor ! " cried Neville blissfully , holding out his hands . 
Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp , coming out at last onto smooth , damp grass right in the shadow of the castle . 
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge , Oak front door . 
" Everyone here ? 
You there , still got yer toad ? " 
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door . 
She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross . 
" The firs ' years , Professor McGonagall , " said Hagrid . 
" Thank you , Hagrid . 
I will take them from here . " 
She pulled the door wide . 
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys ' house in it . 
The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts , the ceiling was too high to make out , and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors . 
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor . 
Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right - the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small , empty chamber off the hall . 
" Welcome to Hogwarts , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" The start - of - term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses . 
The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . 
Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards . 
At the end of the year , the house with the most points is awarded the house cup , a great honor . 
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours . 
" The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school . 
I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . " 
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak , which was fastened under his left ear , and on Ron's smudged nose . 
Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair . 
" I shall return when we are ready for you , " said Professor McGonagall . 
She left the chamber . 
Harry swallowed . 
Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . " 
Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt . 
A test ? 
In front of the whole school ? 
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified , too . 
Harry tried hard not to listen to her . 
He kept his eyes fixed on the door . 
" What the -- ? " 
He gasped . 
Pearly - white and slightly transparent , they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years . 
They seemed to be arguing . 
What looked like a fat little monk was saying : " Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance -- " 
He gives us all a bad name and you know , he's not really even a ghost -- I say , what are you all doing here ? " 
" About to be Sorted , I suppose ? " 
A few people nodded mutely . 
" Hope to see you in Hufflepuff ! " said the Friar . 
" My old house , you know . " 
Professor McGonagall had returned . 
One by one , the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall . 
" Now , form a line , " Professor McGonagall told the first years , " and follow me . " 
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead , Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair , with Ron behind him , and they walked out of the chamber , back across the hall , and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall . 
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place . 
It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables , where the rest of the students were sitting . 
At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting . 
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here , so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students , with the teachers behind them . 
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight . 
Dotted here and there among the students , the ghosts shone misty silver . 
He heard 
I read about it in Hogwarts , A History . " 
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all , and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens . 
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four - legged stool in front of the first years . 
On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat . 
This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty . 
Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house . 
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it , Harry thought wildly , that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat , he stared at it , too . 
For a few seconds , there was complete silence . 
Then the hat twitched . 
A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing : 
" Oh , you may not think I'm pretty , 
I ' ll eat myself if you can find 
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat 
So try me on and I will tell you 
Where you ought to be . 
Where they are just and loyal , 
Or perhaps in Slytherin 
So put me on ! 
For I'm a Thinking Cap ! " 
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song . 
It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again . 
" So we ' ve just got to try on the hat ! " Ron whispered to Harry . 
Harry . 
smiled weakly . 
The hat seemed to be asking rather alot ; Harry didn't feel brave or quick - witted or any of it at the moment . 
If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy , that would have been the one for him . 
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment . 
" When I call your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted , " she said . 
" Abbott , Hannah ! " 
A pink - faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line , put on the hat , which fell right down over her eyes , and sat down . 
A moments pause - 
" HUFFLEPUFF ! " shouted the hat . 
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table . 
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her . 
" Bones , Susan ! " 
" HUFFLEPUFF ! " shouted the hat again , and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah . 
" Boot , Terry ! " 
The table second from the left clapped this time ; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them . 
" Brocklehurst , Mandy " went to Ravenclaw too , but " Brown , Lavender " became the first new Gryffindor , and the table on the far left exploded with cheers ; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling . 
" Bulstrode , Millicent " then became a Slytherin . 
" Finch - Fletchley , Justin ! " 
Sometimes , Harry noticed , the hat shouted out the house at once , but at others it took a little while to decide . 
" Finnigan , Seamus , " the sandy - haired boy next to Harry in the line , sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor . 
" Granger , Hermione ! " 
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head . 
" GRYFFINDOR ! " shouted the hat . 
Ron groaned . 
What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages , until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train ? 
When Neville Longbottom , the boy who kept losing his toad , was called , he fell over on his way to the stool . 
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville . 
When it finally shouted , " GRYFFINDOR , " Neville ran off still wearing it , and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to " MacDougal , Morag . " 
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once : the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed , " SLYTHERIN ! " 
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle , looking pleased with himself . 
" Moon " " Nott " " Parkinson " then a pair of twin girls , " Patil " and " Patil " then " Perks , Sally - Anne " and then , at last -- " Potter , Harry ! " 
As Harry stepped forward , whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall . 
" Potter , did she say ? " 
The Harry Potter ? " 
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him . 
Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat . 
He waited . 
Hmm , " said a small voice in his ear . 
" Difficult . 
Very difficult . 
Not a bad mind either . 
So where shall I put you ? " 
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought , Not Slytherin , not Slytherin . 
" Are you sure ? 
You could be great , you know , it's all here in your head , and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that -- no ? 
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall . 
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table . 
He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin , he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet . 
Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously , while the Weasley twins yelled , " We got Potter ! 
We got Potter ! " 
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier . 
The ghost patted his arm , giving Harry the sudden , horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice - cold water . 
At the end nearest him sat Hagrid , who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up . 
Harry grinned back . 
And there , in the center of the High Table , in a large gold chair , sat Albus Dumbledore . 
Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train . 
Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts . 
Harry spotted Professor Quirtell , too , the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron . 
He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban . 
And now there were only three people left to be sorted . 
" Thomas , Dean , " a Black boy even taller than Ron , joined Harry at the Gryffindor table . 
He was pale green by now . 
Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted , " GRYFFINDOR ! " 
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him . 
Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away . 
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate . 
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet . 
He was beaming at the students , his arms opened wide , as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there . 
" Welcome , " he said . 
" Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts ! 
Before we begin our banquet , I would like to say a few words . 
And here they are : Nitwit ! 
" Thank you ! " 
He sat back down . 
Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not . 
" Is he -- a bit mad ? " he asked Percy uncertainly . 
" Mad ? " said Percy airily . 
" He's a genius ! 
Best wizard in the world ! 
But he is a bit mad , yes . 
Potatoes , Harry ? " 
Harry's mouth fell open . 
The dishes in front of him were now piled with food . 
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry , but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked . 
Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat . 
It was all delicious . 
" That does look good , " said the ghost in the ruff sadly , watching Harry cut up his steak , 
I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years , " said the ghost . 
" I don't need to , of course , but one does miss it . 
I don't think I ' ve in troduced myself ? 
" I know who you are ! " said Ron suddenly . 
" My brothers told me about you -- you ' re Nearly Headless Nick ! " 
" I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -- " the ghost began stiffly , but sandy - haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted . 
How can you be nearly headless ? " 
" Like this , " he said irritably . 
He seized his left ear and pulled . 
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces , Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck , coughed , and said , " So -- new Gryffindors ! 
I hope you ' re going to help us win the house championship this year ? 
Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row ! 
The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost . " 
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there , with blank staring eyes , a gaunt face , and robes stained with silver blood . 
He was right next to Malfoy who , Harry was pleased to see , didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements . 
" I ' ve never asked , " said Nearly Headless Nick delicately . 
When everyone had eaten as much as they could , the remains of the food faded from the plates , leaving them sparkling clean as before . 
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart , the talk turned to their families . 
" I'm half - and - half , " said Seamus . 
" Me dad's a Muggle . 
The others laughed . 
" What about you , Neville ? " said Ron . 
Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go . 
But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road . 
And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see . 
Harry , who was starting to feel warm and sleepy , looked up at the High Table again . 
Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet . 
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore . 
Professor Quirrell , in his absurd turban , was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair , a hooked nose , and sallow skin . 
It happened very suddenly . 
The hook - nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp , hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead . 
" Ouch ! " Harry clapped a hand to his head . 
" What is it ? " 
asked Percy . 
" N - nothing . " 
Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all . 
" Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? " he asked Percy . 
" Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? 
No wonder he's looking so nervous , that's Professor Snape . 
He teaches Potions , but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job . 
Harry watched Snape for a while , but Snape didn't look at him again . 
The hall fell silent . 
I have a few start - of - term notices to give you . 
" First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils . 
Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins . 
" I have also been asked by Mr . Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors . 
" Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term . 
" And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third - floor corridor on the right - hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . " 
Harry laughed , but he was one of the few who did . 
" He's not serious ? " he muttered to Percy . 
" Must be , " said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore . 
" It's odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we ' re not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that . 
" And now , before we go to bed , let us sing the school song ! " cried Dumbledore . 
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick , as if he was trying to get a fly off the end , and a long golden ribbon flew out of it , which rose high above the tables and twisted itself , snakelike , into words . 
And the school bellowed : 
" Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts , 
Teach us something please , 
For now they ' re bare and full of air , 
So teach us things worth knowing , 
just do your best , we ' ll do the rest , 
" A magic beyond all we do here ! 
And now , bedtime . 
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds , out of the Great Hall , and up the marble staircase . 
Harry's legs were like lead again , but only because he was so tired and full of food . 
He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed , or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries . 
" Peeves , " Percy whispered to the first years . 
" A poltergeist . " 
He raised his voice , " Peeves -- show yourself " 
" Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron ? " 
There was a pop , and a little man with wicked , dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared , floating cross - legged in the air , clutching the walking sticks . 
What fun ! " 
They all ducked . 
barked Percy . 
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished , dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head . 
" You want to watch out for Peeves , " said Percy , as they set off again . 
" The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him , he won't even listen to us prefects . 
Here we are . " 
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress . 
" Password ? " she said . 
" Caput Draconis , " said Percy , and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall . 
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another . 
At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last : five four - posters hung with deep red , velvet curtains . 
Their trunks had already been brought up . 
Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings . 
Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart , but he fell asleep almost at once . 
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much , because he had a very strange dream . 
Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin ; it got heavier and heavier ; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy , laughing at him as he struggled with it - then Malfoy turned into the hook - nosed teacher , Snape , whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke , sweating and shaking . 
He rolled over and fell asleep again , and when he woke next day , he didn't remember the dream at all . 
" Where ? " 
" Next to the tall kid with the red hair . " 
" Wearing the glasses ? " 
" Did you see his face ? " 
" Did you see his scar ? " 
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day . 
Harry wished they wouldn't , because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes . 
Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely , or tickled them in exactly the right place , and doors that weren't really doors at all , but solid walls just pretending . 
It was also very hard to remember where anything was , because it all seemed to move around a lot . 
The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other , and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk . 
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning . 
Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out - of - bounds corridor on the third floor . 
Filch owned a cat called Mrs . Norris , a scrawny , dust - colored creature with bulging , lamp like eyes just like Filch's . 
She patrolled the corridors alone . 
Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone ( except perhaps the Weasley twins ) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts . 
And then , once you had managed to find them , there were the classes themselves . 
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets . 
Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology , with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout , where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi , and found out what they were used for . 
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic , which was the only one taught by a ghost . 
Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him . 
Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up . 
Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk . 
At the start of their first class he took the roll call , and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight . 
Professor McGonagall was again different . 
" Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , " she said . 
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again . 
After taking a lot of complicated notes , they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle . 
By the end of the lesson , only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match ; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile . 
For one thing , when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie , Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather ; for another , they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban , and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well , so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went . 
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron . 
" What have we got today ? " 
Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge . 
" Double Potions with the Slytherins , " said Ron . " Snape's Head of Slytherin House . 
" Wish McGonagall favored us , " said Harry . 
Just then , the mail arrived . 
Harry had gotten used to this by now , but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning , when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast , circling the tables until they saw their owners , and dropping letters and packages onto their laps . 
She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls . 
This morning , however , she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate . 
Dear Harry , 
I know you get Friday afternoons off , so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three ? 
I want to hear all about your first week . 
Hagrid 
Harry borrowed Ron's quill , scribbled Yes , please , see you later on the back of the note , and sent Hedwig off again . 
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to , because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far . 
At the start - of - term banquet , Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him . 
By the end of the first Potions lesson , he knew he'd been wrong . 
It was colder here than up in the main castle , and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls . 
Snape , like Flitwick , started the class by taking the roll call , and like Flitwick , he paused at Harry's name . 
" Ah , Yes , " he said softly , " Harry Potter . 
Our new -- celebrity . " 
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands . 
Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class . 
His eyes were black like Hagrid's , but they had none of Hagrid's warmth . 
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels . 
" You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking , " he began . 
I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses .... 
I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . " 
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows . 
" Potter ! " said Snape suddenly . 
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ? 
Harry glanced at Ron , who looked as stumped as he was ; Hermione's hand had shot into the air . 
" I don't know , sit , " said Harry . 
Snape's lips curled into a sneer . 
He ignored Hermione's hand . 
" Let's try again . 
Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? " 
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat , but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was . 
He tried not to look at Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , who were shaking with laughter . 
Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes . 
" What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? " 
At this , Hermione stood up , her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling . 
" I don't know , " said Harry quietly . 
" I think Hermione does , though , why don't you try her ? " 
A few people laughed ; Harry caught Seamus's eye , and Seamus winked . 
" Sit down , " he snapped at Hermione . 
" For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . 
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . 
As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . 
Well ? 
Over the noise , Snape said , " And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . " 
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued . 
Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils . 
He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon . 
Within seconds , the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville , who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed , moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs . 
" I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? " 
" Take him up to the hospital wing , " Snape spat at Seamus . 
Then he rounded on Harry and Ron , who had been working next to Neville . 
" You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills ? 
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue , but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron . 
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later , Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low . 
He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much ? 
Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? " 
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds . 
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest . 
A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door . 
Then Hagrid's voice rang out , saying , " Back , Fang -- back . " 
Hagrid's big , hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open . 
" Hang on , " he said . 
" Back , Fang . " 
Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling , a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire , and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it . 
Like Hagrid , Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked . 
" This is Ron , " Harry told Hagrid , who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate . 
" Another Weasley , eh ? " said Hagrid , glancing at Ron's freckles . 
Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes . 
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch " that old git . " 
Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it . " 
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson . 
Hagrid , like Ron , told Harry not to worry about it , that Snape liked hardly any of the students . 
" But he seemed to really hate me . " 
" Rubbish ! " said Hagrid . 
" Why should he ? " 
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that . 
" How's yer brother Charlie ? " Hagrid asked Ron . 
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons , Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy . 
It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : 
Investigations continue into the break - in at Gringotts on 31 July , widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown . 
" But we ' re not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you , " said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon . 
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn't mentioned the date . 
" Hagrid ! " said Harry , " that Gringotts break - in happened on my birthday ! 
It might ' ve been happening while we were there ! " 
There was no doubt about it , Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time . 
He grunted and offered him another rock cake . 
Harry read the story again . 
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day . 
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner , their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse , Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid . 
Had Hagrid collected that package just in time ? 
Where was it now ? 
And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry ? 
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley , but that was before he met Draco Malfoy . 
Still , first - year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins , so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much . 
" Typical , " said Harry darkly . 
To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy . " 
" Anyway , I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch , but I bet that's all talk . " 
He wasn't the only one , though : the way Seamus Finnigan told it , he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick . 
Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom . 
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life , because his grandmother had never let him near one . 
At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages . 
Neville was hanging on to her every word , desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later , but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail . 
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note , something that Malfoy had been quick to notice , of course . 
" It's a Remembrall ! " he explained . 
Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh ... " His face fell , because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet , 
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet . 
" What's going on ? " 
Scowling , Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table . 
" Just looking , " he said , and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him . 
At three - thirty that afternoon , Harry , Ron , and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson . 
It was a clear , breezy day , and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth , flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest , whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance . 
The Slytherins were already there , and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground . 
Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms , saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high , or always flew slightly to the left . 
She had short , gray hair , and yellow eyes like a hawk . 
" Well , what are you all waiting for ? " she barked . 
Come on , hurry up . " 
Harry glanced down at his broom . 
It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles . 
Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once , but it was one of the few that did . 
Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground , and Neville's hadn't moved at all . 
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end , and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips . 
" Now , when I blow my whistle , you kick off from the ground , hard , " said Madam Hooch . 
Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away , saw him gasp , slip sideways off the broom and - 
WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap . 
His broomstick was still rising higher and higher , and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight . 
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville , her face as white as his . 
" Broken wrist , " Harry heard her mutter . 
" Come on , boy -- it's all right , up you get . " . 
She turned to the rest of the class . 
" None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing ! 
Neville , his face tear - streaked , clutching his wrist , hobbled off with Madam Hooch , who had her arm around him . 
The other Slytherins joined in . 
" Shut up , Malfoy , " snapped Parvati Patil . 
" Look ! " said Malfoy , darting forward and snatching something out of the grass . 
" It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him . " 
" Give that here , Malfoy , " said Harry quietly . 
Everyone stopped talking to watch . 
Malfoy smiled nastily . 
" I think I ' ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about - up a tree ? " 
" Give it here ! " 
Harry grabbed his broom . 
" No ! " shouted Hermione Granger . 
" Madam Hooch told us not to move - you ' ll get us all into trouble . " 
Harry ignored her . 
He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up , up he soared ; air rushed through his hair , and his robes whipped out behind him - and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy , this was wonderful . 
He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher , and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron . 
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair . 
Malfoy looked stunned . 
Harry knew , somehow , what to do . 
He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands , and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin . 
Malfoy only just got out of the way in time ; Harry made a sharp about - face and held the broom steady . 
A few people below were clapping . 
" Catch it if you can , then ! " he shouted , and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground . 
Harry saw , as though in slow motion , the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall . 
He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive , racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears , mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it , just in time to pull his broom straight , and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist . 
" HARRY POTTER ! " 
Professor McGonagall was running toward them . 
He got to his feet , trembling . 
" But Malfoy -- " 
" That's enough , Mr . Weasley . 
Potter , follow me , now . " 
Harry caught sight of Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left , walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle . 
He was going to be expelled , he just knew it . 
He wanted to say something to defend himself , but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice . 
What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep ? 
Up the front steps , up the marble staircase inside , and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him . 
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore . 
Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant . 
His stomach twisted as he imagined it , watching Ron and the others becoming wizards , while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag . 
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom . 
She opened the door and poked her head inside . 
" Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ? " 
Wood ? thought Harry , bewildered ; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him ? 
But Wood turned out to be a person , a burly fifth - year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused . 
" Follow me , you two , " said Professor McGonagall , and they marched on up the corridor , Wood looking curiously at Harry . 
" In here . " 
" Out , Peeves ! " she barked . 
Peeves threw the chalk into a bin , which clanged loudly , and he swooped out cursing . 
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys . 
" Potter , this is Oliver Wood . 
" Are you serious , Professor ? " 
" Absolutely , " said Professor McGonagall crisply . 
" The boy's a natural . 
I ' ve never seen anything like it . 
Harry nodded silently . 
" He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty - foot dive , " Professor McGonagall told Wood . 
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once . 
" Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team , " Professor McGonagall explained . 
" Light -- speedy -- we ' ll have to get him a decent broom , Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven , I'd say . " 
I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first - year rule . 
Heaven knows , we need a better team than last year . 
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin , I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks .... " 
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry . 
" I want to hear you ' re training hard , Potter , or I may change my mind about punishing you . " 
Then she suddenly smiled . 
" You ' re joking . " 
It was dinnertime . 
Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall . 
" Seeker ? " he said . 
He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon . 
" Wood told me . " 
Ron was so amazed , so impressed , he just sat and gaped at Harry . 
" I start training next week , " said Harry . 
" Only don't tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret . " 
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall , spotted Harry , and hurried over . 
" Wood told us . 
We're on the team too -- Beaters . " 
" Anyway , we ' ve got to go , Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school . " 
" Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . 
See you . " 
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up : Malfoy , flanked by Crabbe and Goyle . 
When are you getting the train back to the Muggles ? " 
" You ' re a lot braver now that you ' re back on the ground and you ' ve got your little friends with you , " said Harry coolly . 
There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle , but as the High Table was full of teachers , neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl . 
" I'd take you on anytime on my own , " said Malfoy . 
What's the matter ? 
Never heard of a wizard's duel before , I suppose ? " 
" Of course he has , " said Ron , wheeling around . 
" I'm his second , who's yours ? " 
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle , sizing them up . 
" Crabbe , " he said . 
" Midnight all right ? 
When Malfoy had gone , Ron and Harry looked at each other . 
" What is a wizard's duel ? " said Harry . 
" And what do you mean , you ' re my second ? " 
I bet he expected you to refuse , anyway . " 
" And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens ? " 
" Throw it away and punch him on the nose , " Ron suggested . 
" Excuse me . " 
It was Hermione Granger . 
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry . 
" Bet you could , " Ron muttered . 
" -- and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night , think of the points you ' ll lose Gryffindor if you ' re caught , and you ' re bound to be . 
" And it's really none of your business , " said Harry . 
" Good - bye , " said Ron . 
All the same , it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day , Harry thought , as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep ( Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing ) . 
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs . Norris , and Harry felt he was pushing his luck , breaking another school rule today . 
They pulled on their bathrobes , picked up their wands , and crept across the tower room , down the spiral staircase , and into the Gryffindor common room . 
A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace , turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows . 
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them , " I can't believe you ' re going to do this , Harry . " 
A lamp flickered on . 
It was Hermione Granger , wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown . 
" You ! " said Ron furiously . 
" Go back to bed ! " 
" Come on , " he said to Ron . 
He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole . 
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily . 
She followed Ron through the portrait hole , hissing at them like an angry goose . 
" Go away . " 
" All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you ' re on the train home tomorrow , you ' re so -- " 
Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting . 
" That's your problem , " said Ron . " We ' ve got to go , we 3 re going to be late . " 
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them . 
" I'm coming with you , " she said . 
" You are not . " 
" D ' you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? 
If he finds all three of us I ' ll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . " 
" You ' ve got some nerve -- " said Ron loudly . 
" Shut up , both of you ! " said Harry sharply . 
I heard something . " 
It was a sort of snuffling . 
" Mrs . 
It wasn't Mrs . Norris . 
It was Neville . 
He was curled up on the floor , fast asleep , but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer . 
" Thank goodness you found me ! 
I ' ve been out here for hours , I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed . " 
" How's your arm ? " said Harry . 
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville . 
" If either of you get us caught , I ' ll never rest until I ' ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you . 
Hermione opened her mouth , perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies , but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward . 
They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room . 
Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet . 
They edged along the walls , keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room . 
Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once . 
" He's late , maybe he's chickened out , " Ron whispered . 
Then a noise in the next room made them jump . 
" Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . " 
It was Filch speaking to Mrs . Norris . 
Horror - struck , Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible ; they scurried silently toward the door , away from Filch's voice . 
" This way ! " Harry mouthed to the others and , petrified , they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor . 
Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run - he tripped , grabbed Ron around the waist , and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor . 
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle . 
" RUN ! " Harry yelled , and the four of them sprinted down the gallery , not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another , Harry in the lead , without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway , hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom , which they knew was miles from the trophy room . 
" I think we ' ve lost him , " Harry panted , leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead . 
I -- told - you , " Hermione gasped , clutching at the stitch in her chest , " I -- told -- you . " 
" We ' ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower , " said Ron , " quickly as possible . " 
" Malfoy tricked you , " Hermione said to Harry . 
Harry thought she was probably right , but he wasn't going to tell her that . 
" Let's go . " 
They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them . 
It was Peeves . 
He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight . 
Peeves cackled . 
Naughty , naughty , you ' ll get caughty . " 
" Should tell Filch , I should , " said Peeves in a saintly voice , but his eyes glittered wickedly . 
Ducking under Peeves , they ran for their lives , right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked . 
" This is it ! " 
This is the end ! " 
They could hear footsteps , Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts . 
She grabbed Harry's wand , tapped the lock , and whispered , ' Alohomora ! " 
The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it , shut it quickly , and pressed their ears against it , listening . 
" Which way did they go , Peeves ? " Filch was saying . 
" Quick , tell me . " 
" Say ' please . " ' 
" All right - please . " 
Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please ! 
Ha ha ! Haaaaaa ! " 
" He thinks this door is locked , " Harry whispered . 
For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute . 
" What ? " 
Harry turned around -- and saw , quite clearly , what . 
For a moment , he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much , on top of everything that had happened so far . 
The forbidden corridor on the third floor . 
And now they knew why it was forbidden . 
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog , a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor . 
It had three heads . 
Three pairs of rolling , mad eyes ; three noses , twitching and quivering in their direction ; three drooling mouths , saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs . 
It was standing quite still , all six eyes staring at them , and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise , but it was quickly getting over that , there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant . 
They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut , and they ran , they almost flew , back down the corridor . 
They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor . 
They scrambled into the common room and collapsed , trembling , into armchairs . 
It was a while before any of them said anything . 
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again . 
" You don't use your eyes , any of you , do you ? " 
she snapped . 
" The floor ? " 
Harry suggested . 
" No , not the floor . 
It was standing on a trapdoor . 
It's obviously guarding something . " 
She stood up , glaring at them . 
I hope you ' re pleased with yourselves . 
Now , if you don't mind , I'm going to bed . " 
Ron stared after her , his mouth open . 
The dog was guarding something .... What had Hagrid said ? 
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts . 
Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day , looking tired but perfectly cheerful . 
Indeed , by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three - headed dog had been an excellent adventure , and they were quite keen to have another one . 
" It's either really valuable or really dangerous , " said Ron . " Or both , " said Harry . 
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor . 
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron , but she was such a bossy know - it - all that they saw this as an added bonus . 
Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel , and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him , knocking his bacon to the floor . 
They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel . 
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE . 
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o ' clock for your first training session . 
Professor McGonagall 
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read . 
" A Nimbus Two Thousand ! " 
Ron moaned enviously . 
They left the hall quickly , wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class , but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle . 
Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it . 
" That's a broomstick , " he said , throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face . 
Ron couldn't resist it . 
" It's not any old broomstick , " he said , " it's a Nimbus Two Thousand . 
What did you say you ' ve got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? " Ron grinned at Harry . 
" Comets look flashy , but they ' re not in the same league as the Nimbus . " 
" What would you know about it , Weasley , you couldn't afford half the handle , " Malfoy snapped back . 
Before Ron could answer , Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow . 
" Yes , yes , that's right , " said Professor Flitwick , beaming at Harry . 
" Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . 
And what model is it ? " 
" And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I ' ve got it , " he added . 
Harry and Ron headed upstairs , smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion . 
" Well , it's true , " Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase , " If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team .... " 
" So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules ? " came an angry voice from just behind them . 
Hermione was stomping up the stairs , looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand . 
" I thought you weren't speaking to us ? " said Harry . 
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air . 
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day . 
It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed , or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night . 
As seven o ' clock drew nearer , Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field . 
Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on . 
At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end . 
They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through , except that they were fifty feet high . 
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood , Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground . 
What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field . 
" Hey , Potter , come down ! ' 
Oliver Wood had arrived . 
fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm . 
Harry landed next to him . 
" Very nice , " said Wood , his eyes glinting . 
I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you ' ll be joining team practice three times a week . " 
He opened the crate . 
Inside were four different - sized balls . 
" Right , " said Wood . " Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it's not too easy to play . 
There are seven players on each side . 
" Three Chasers , " Harry repeated , as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball . 
" This ball's called the Quaffle , " said Wood . " The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . 
Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . 
Follow me ? " 
" The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , " Harry recited . 
" What's basketball ? " said Wood curiously . 
" Never mind , " said Harry quickly . 
I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . " 
" Three Chasers , one Keeper , " said Harry , who was determined to remember it all . 
" And they play with the Quaffle . 
Okay , got that . 
So what are they for ? " 
He pointed at the three balls left inside the box . 
" I ' ll show you now , " said Wood . " Take this . " 
He handed Harry a small club , a bit like a short baseball bat . 
" I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do , " Wood said . 
" These two are the Bludgers . " 
He showed Harry two identical balls , jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle . 
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box . 
" Stand back , " Wood warned Harry . 
He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers . 
At once , the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face . 
Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose , and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood , who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground . 
" See ? " Wood panted , forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely . 
That's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . 
So -- think you ' ve got all that ? " 
" Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , " Harry reeled off . 
" Very good , " said Wood . 
Harry asked , hoping he sounded offhand . 
" Never at Hogwarts . 
Now , the last member of the team is the 
That's you . 
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball . 
Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers , it was tiny , about the size of a large walnut . 
" This , " said Wood , " is the Golden Snitch , and it's the most important ball of the lot . 
It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see . 
It's the Seeker's job to catch it . 
You ' ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . 
A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep . 
" Well , that's it -- any questions ? " 
Harry shook his head . 
He understood what he had to do all right , it was doing it that was going to be the problem . 
Let's try you out with a few of these . " 
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later , he and Harry were up in the air , Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch . 
The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had . 
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors . 
Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice . 
Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan ( which was a relief , because Neville had been trying to catch his eye ) . 
Ron , however , was to be working with Hermione Granger . 
And saying the magic words properly is very important , too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said's ' instead of ' f ' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . " 
It was very difficult . 
Harry and Seamus swished and flicked , but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop . 
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat . 
" You ' re saying it wrong , " Harry heard Hermione snap . 
" It's Wing - gar - dium Levi - o - sa , make the ' gar ' nice and long . " 
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown , flicked her wand , and said , " Wingardium Leviosa ! " 
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class . 
It was Hermione . 
Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears . 
" I think she heard you . " 
" So ? " said Ron , but he looked a bit uncomfortable . 
On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast , Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls ' bathroom and wanted to be left alone . 
Ron looked still more awkward at this , but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall , where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds . 
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds , making the candles in the pumpkins stutter . 
The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates , as it had at the start - of - term banquet . 
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall , his turban askew and terror on his face . 
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint . 
" Follow me ! 
Stick together , first years ! 
Excuse me , I'm a prefect ! " 
Harry asked as they climbed the stairs . 
As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs , Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm . 
" I ' ve just thought -- Hermione . " 
" What about her ? " 
Ron bit his lip . 
Ducking down , they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way , slipped down a deserted side corridor , and hurried off toward the girls ' bathroom . 
They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them . 
He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view . 
" What's he doing ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? " 
" Search me . " 
" He's heading for the third floor , " Harry said , but Ron held up his hand . 
" Can you smell something ? " 
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils , a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean . 
And then they heard it -- a low grunting , and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet . 
Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left , something huge was moving toward them . 
They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight . 
It was a horrible sight . 
Twelve feet tall , its skin was a dull , granite gray , its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut . 
" The keys in the lock , " Harry muttered . 
" Good idea , " said Ron nervously . 
They edged toward the open door , mouths dry , praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it . 
With one great leap , Harry managed to grab the key , slam the door , and lock it . 
' Yes ! " 
" Oh , no , " said Ron , pale as the Bloody Baron . 
" It's the girls ' bathroom ! " 
Harry gasped . 
" Hermione ! " they said together . 
Wheeling around , they sprinted back to the door and turned the key , fumbling in their panic . 
Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside . 
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite , looking as if she was about to faint . 
The troll was advancing on her , knocking the sinks off the walls as it went . 
" Confuse it ! " 
Harry said desperately to Ron , and , seizing a tap , he threw it as hard as he could against the wall . 
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione . 
Its mean little eyes saw Harry . 
yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber , and he threw a metal pipe at it . 
" Come on , run , run ! " 
Harry yelled at Hermione , trying to pull her toward the door , but she couldn't move , she was still flat against the wall , her mouth open with terror . 
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk . 
It roared again and started toward Ron , who was nearest and had no way to escape . 
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head : " Wingardium Leviosa ! " 
The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand , rose high , high up into the air , turned slowly over -- and dropped , with a sickening crack , onto its owner's head . 
The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face , with a thud that made the whole room tremble . 
Harry got to his feet . 
He was shaking and out of breath . 
Ron was standing there with his wand still raised , staring at what he had done . 
It was Hermione who spoke first . 
" Is it -- dead ? " 
I don't think so , " said Harry , I think it's just been knocked out . " 
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose . 
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up . 
A moment later , Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room , closely followed by Snape , with Quirrell bringing up the rear . 
Quirrell took one look at the troll , let out a faint whimper , and sat quickly down on a toilet , clutching his heart . 
Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry . 
Her lips were white . 
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind . 
Harry looked at Ron , who was still standing with his wand in the air . 
Snape gave Harry a swift , piercing look . 
Harry looked at the floor . 
He wished Ron would put his wand down . 
Then a small voice came out of the shadows . 
" Please , Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me . " 
" Miss Granger ! " 
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last . 
I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know , because I ' ve read all about them . " 
Ron dropped his wand . 
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them . 
" Well -- in that case ... " said Professor McGonagall , staring at the three of them , " Miss Granger , you foolish girl , how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own ? " 
Hermione hung her head . 
Harry was speechless . 
Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules , and here she was , pretending she had , to get them out of trouble . 
" Miss Granger , five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" I'm very disappointed in you . 
If you ' re not hurt at all , you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower . 
Hermione left . 
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron . 
You each win Gryffindor five points . 
Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this . 
You may go . " 
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up . 
It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll , quite apart from anything else . 
" We should have gotten more than ten points , " Ron grumbled . 
" Good of her to get us out of trouble like that , " Ron admitted . 
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady . 
The common room was packed and noisy . 
Hermione , however , stood alone by the door , waiting for them . 
The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel . 
On Saturday , Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training : Gryffindor versus Slytherin . 
If Gryffindor won , they would move up into second place in the house championship . 
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that , as their secret weapon , Harry should be kept , well , secret . 
She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages , which turned out to be a very interesting read . 
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473 ; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players , and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them ; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch , referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert . 
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll , and she was much nicer for it . 
The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break , and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar . 
They were standing with their backs to it , getting warm , when Snape crossed the yard . 
Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping . 
He hadn't seen the fire , but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway . 
It was Quidditch Through the Ages . 
Harry showed him . 
" Give it to me . 
Five points from Gryffindor . " 
" Wonder what's wrong with his leg ? " 
" Dunno , but I hope it's really hurting him , " said Ron bitterly . 
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat together next to a window . 
Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them . 
Harry felt restless . 
He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back , to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow . 
Why should he be afraid of Snape ? 
Getting up , he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it . 
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked . 
He knocked again . 
Nothing . 
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there ? 
It was worth a try . 
He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes . 
Snape and Filch were inside , alone . 
Snape was holding his robes above his knees . 
One of his legs was bloody and mangled . 
Filch was handing Snape bandages . 
" Blasted thing * , " Snape was saying . 
Harry tried to shut the door quietly , but - 
" POTTER ! " 
Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg . 
Harry gulped . 
" I just wondered if I could have my book back . " 
" GET OUT ! OUT ! " 
Harry left , before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor . 
" Did you get it ? " 
Ron asked as Harry joined them . 
" What's the matter ? " 
" You know what this means ? " he finished breathlessly . 
" He tried to get past that three - headed dog at Halloween ! 
That's where he was going when we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding ! 
Hermione's eyes were wide . 
" No -- he wouldn't , she said . 
" I know he's not very nice , but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe . " 
" Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , " snapped Ron . 
" I'm with Harry . 
But what's he after ? 
What's that dog guarding ? " 
He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep , he had to , he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget . 
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match . 
" You ' ve got to eat some breakfast . " 
" I don't want anything . " 
" I'm not hungry . " 
Harry felt terrible . 
" Harry , you need your strength , " said Seamus Finnigan . 
" Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . " 
By eleven o ' clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch . 
Ron and Hermione joined Neville , Seamus , and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row . 
As a surprise for Harry , they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined . 
Meanwhile , in the locker room , Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes ( Slytherin would be playing in green ) . 
Wood cleared his throat for silence . 
" Okay , men , " he said . 
" And women , " Wood agreed . 
" This is it . " 
" The big one , " said Fred Weasley . 
" Shut up , you two , " said Wood . " This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years . 
We're going to win . 
I know it . " 
He glared at them all as if to say , " Or else . " 
" Right . 
It's time . 
Good luck , all of you . " 
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and , hoping his knees weren't going to give way , walked onto the field to loud cheers . 
Madam Hooch was refereeing . 
She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams , her broom in her hand . 
Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above , flashing Potter for President over the crowd . 
" And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too -- " 
" Sorry , Professor . " 
The Weasley twins ' friend , Lee Jordan , was doing the commentary for the match , closely watched by Professor McGonagall . 
" And she's really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood's , last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc - no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead 
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air , with howls and moans from the Slytherins . 
" Hagrid ! " 
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them . 
No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? " 
" Nope , " said Ron . " Harry hasn't had much to do yet . " 
" Kept outta trouble , though , that's somethin ' , " said Hagrid , raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry . 
Way up above them , Harry was gliding over the game , squinting about for some sign of the Snitch . 
This was part of his and Wood's game plan . 
" Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , " Wood had said . 
" We don't want you attacked before you have to be . " 
Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch . 
Once he caught sight of a flash of gold , but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys ' wristwatches , and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way , more like a cannonball than anything , but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it . 
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle , too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear . 
Harry saw it . 
In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold . 
Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch - all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch . 
Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball , wings fluttering , darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed - 
A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose , and Harry's broom spun off course , Harry holding on for dear life . 
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor . 
But in all the confusion , of course , the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again . 
" What are you talking about , Dean ? " said Ron . 
" Red card ! " said Dean furiously . 
" In soccer you get shown the red card and you ' re out of the game ! " 
Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . " 
" Jordan ! " growled Professor McGonagall . 
' Jordan , I'm warning you -- " 
" All right , all right . 
Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I'm sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinner , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . " 
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger , which went spinning dangerously past his head , that it happened . 
For a split second , he thought he was going to fall . 
He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees . 
It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off . 
Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal - posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time - out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control . 
No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely . 
He stared through his binoculars . 
" If I didn ' know better , I'd say he'd lost control of his broom ... but he can't have .... " 
Suddenly , people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands . 
Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it . 
Seamus whispered . 
At these words , Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars , but instead of looking up at Harry , she started looking frantically at the crowd . 
" What are you doing ? " moaned Ron , gray - faced . 
" I knew it , " Hermione gasped , " Snape -- look . " 
Ron grabbed the binoculars . 
Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them . 
He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath . 
" He's doing something -- jinxing the broom , " said Hermione . 
" What should we do ? " 
" Leave it to me . " 
Before Ron could say another word , Hermione had disappeared . 
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry . 
The whole crowd was on its feet , watching , terrified , as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms , but it was no good -- every time they got near him , the broom would jump higher still . 
They dropped lower and circled beneath him , obviously hoping to catch him if he fell . 
" Come on , Hermione , " Ron muttered desperately . 
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood , and was now racing along the row behind him ; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front . 
Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes . 
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire . 
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job . 
Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket , she scrambled back along the row - Snape would never know what had happened . 
It was enough . 
Up in the air , Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom . 
" Neville , you can look ! " 
Ron said . 
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand . 
" I ' ve got the Snitch ! " he shouted , waving it above his head , and the game ended in complete confusion . 
" He didn't catch it , he nearly swallowed it , " Flint was still howling twenty minutes later , but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty . 
He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut , with Ron and Hermione . 
" It was Snape , " Ron was explaining , " Hermione and I saw him . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at one another , wondering what to tell him . 
Harry decided on the truth . 
" I found out something about him , " he told Hagrid . 
" He tried to get past that three - headed dog on Halloween . 
We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding . " 
Hagrid dropped the teapot . 
" How do you know about Fluffy ? " he said . 
" Fluffy ? " 
" Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the 
" Yes ? " said Harry eagerly . 
" That's top secret , that is . " 
" But Snape's trying to steal it . " 
" Rubbish , " said Hagrid again . 
" Snape's a Hogwarts teacher , he'd do nothin ' of the sort . " 
" So why did he just try and kill Harry ? " cried Hermione . 
The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape . 
I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I ' ve read all about them ! 
" I'm tellin ' yeh , yer wrong ! " said Hagrid hotly . 
It's dangerous . 
You forget that dog , an ' you forget what it's guardin ' , that's between Professor Dumbledore an ' Nicolas Flamel -- " 
" Aha ! " said Harry , " so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? " 
Hagrid looked furious with himself . 
CHAPTER TWELVE : THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
Christmas was coming . 
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around , bouncing off the back of his turban . 
The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again . 
While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires , the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms . 
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke . 
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled . 
It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas . 
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before , making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays , and Harry had signed up at once . 
Ron and his brothers were staying , too , because Mr . and Mrs . Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie . 
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions , they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead . 
" Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? " 
Ron asked , sticking his head through the branches . 
" Nah , I'm all right , thanks , Ron . " 
" Would you mind moving out of the way ? " came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them . 
" Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? 
Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to . " 
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs . 
" WEASLEY ! " 
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes . 
" Malfoy was insultin ' his family . " 
Move along , all of you . " 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree , scattering needles everywhere and smirking . 
" I hate them both , " said Harry , " Malfoy and Snape . " 
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to - the Great Hall , where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations . 
" Ah , Hagrid , the last tree -- put it in the far corner , would you ? " 
The hall looked spectacular . 
Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls , and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room , some sparkling with tiny icicles , some glittering with hundreds of candles . 
Hagrid asked . 
" Just one , " said Hermione . 
" And that reminds me - Harry , Ron , we ' ve got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . " 
" Oh yeah , you ' re right , " said Ron , tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick , who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree . 
" The library ? " said Hagrid , following them out of the hall . 
" Just before the holidays ? 
" Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we ' ve been trying to find out who he is . " 
" You what ? " Hagrid looked shocked . 
It's nothin'to you what that dog's guardin ' . " 
" We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that's all , " said Hermione . 
Harry added . 
" We must ' ve been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I ' ve read his name somewhere . " 
" I'm sayin ' nothin , said Hagrid flatly . 
" Just have to find out for ourselves , then , " said Ron , and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library . 
The trouble was , it was very hard to know where to begin , not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book . 
He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century , or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing , too , from Important Modern Magical Discoveries , and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry . 
And then , of course , there was the sheer size of the library ; tens of thousands of books ; thousands of shelves ; hundreds of narrow rows . 
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random . 
Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section . 
Unfortunately , you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books , and he knew he'd never get one . 
" What are you looking for , boy ? " 
" Nothing , " said Harry . 
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him . 
" You'd better get out , then . 
He , Ron , and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel . 
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything , but he wasn't very hopeful . 
Five minutes later , Ron and Hermione joined him , shaking their heads . 
They went off to lunch . 
" And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , " said Ron . " It'd be safe to ask them . " 
" Very safe , as they ' re both dentists , " said Hermione . 
Once the holidays had started , Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel . 
They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual , so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire . 
Ron's set was very old and battered . 
On Christmas Eve , Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun , but not expecting any presents at all . 
When he woke early in the morning , however , the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed . 
" Merry Christmas , " said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe . 
" You , too , " said Harry . 
" What did you expect , turnips ? " said Ron , turning to his own pile , which was a lot bigger than Harry's . 
Harry picked up the top parcel . 
Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute . 
Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself . 
Harry blew it - it sounded a bit like an owl . 
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present . 
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia . 
" That's friendly , " said Harry . 
" Weird ! " he said , ' NMat a shape ! 
This is money ? " 
" Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these ? " 
" My mom . 
I told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh , no , " he groaned , " she's made you a Weasley sweater . " 
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick , hand - knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge . 
Harry picked it up and felt it . 
It was very light . 
He unwrapped it . 
Ron gasped . 
" If that's what I think it is -- they ' re really rare , and really valuable . " 
" What is it ? " 
Harry picked the shining , silvery cloth off the floor . 
It was strange to the touch , like water woven into material . 
" I'm sure it is -- try it on . " 
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell . 
" It is ! Look down ! " 
Harry looked down at his feet , but they were gone . 
He dashed to the mirror . 
Sure enough , his reflection looked back at him , just his head suspended in midair , his body completely invisible . 
He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely . 
" There's a note ! " said Ron suddenly . 
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter . 
It is time it was returned to you . 
A Very Merry Christmas to you . 
There was no signature . 
Harry stared at the note . 
Ron was admiring the cloak . 
" Anything . 
What's the matter ? " 
" Nothing , " said Harry . 
He felt very strange . 
Had it really once belonged to his father ? 
Before he could say or think anything else , the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in . 
Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight . 
" Merry Christmas ! " 
" Hey , look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater , too ! " 
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters , one with a large yellow F on it , the other a G . 
" Harry's is better than ours , though , " said Fred , holding up Harry's sweater . 
" Come on , get it on , they ' re lovely and warm . " 
" I hate maroon , " Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head . 
" I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name . 
But we ' re not stupid -- we know we ' re called Gred and Forge . " 
" What's all th is noise . 
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door , looking disapproving . 
Fred seized . 
Get it on , Percy , come on , we ' re all wearing ours , even Harry got one . " 
George . 
" Christmas is a time for family . " 
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner . 
A hundred fat , roast turkeys ; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes ; platters of chipolatas ; tureens of buttered peas , silver boats of thick , rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table . 
These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought , with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside . 
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang , it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke , while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live , white mice . 
Up at the High Table , Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet , and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him . 
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice . 
Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine , finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek , who , to Harry's amazement , giggled and blushed , her top hat lopsided . 
When Harry finally left the table , he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers , including a pack of nonexplodable , luminous balloons , a Grow - Your - Own - Warts kit , and his own new wizard chess set . 
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds . 
Then , cold , wet , and gasping for breath , they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room , where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron . 
He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much . 
After a meal of turkey sandwiches , crumpets , trifle , and Christmas cake , everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge . 
It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever . 
Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it : the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it . 
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it . 
His father's ... this had been his father's . 
He let the material flow over his hands , smoother than silk , light as air . 
He had to try it , now . 
It was a very funny feeling . 
Suddenly , Harry felt wide - awake . 
Ron grunted in his sleep . 
Should Harry wake him ? 
Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone . 
He crept out of the dormitory , down the stairs , across the common room , and climbed through the portrait hole . 
Harry said nothing . 
He walked quickly down the corridor . 
Where should he go ? 
He stopped , his heart racing , and thought . 
And then it came to him . 
The Restricted Section in the library . 
He'd be able to read as long as he liked , as long as it took to find out who Flamel was . 
Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books . 
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library . 
Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library , he held up his lamp to read the titles . 
Some had no title at all . 
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood . 
The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled . 
Maybe he was imagining it , maybe not , but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books , as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be . 
Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor , he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book . 
A large black and silver volume caught his eye . 
He pulled it out with difficulty , because it was very heavy , and , balancing it on his knee , let it fall open . 
A piercing , bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming ! 
Panicking , he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf , he ran for it . 
He passed Filch in the doorway ; Filch's pale , wild eyes looked straight through him , and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor , the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears . 
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor . 
He had been so busy getting away from the library , he hadn't paid attention to where he was going . 
There was a suit of armor near the kitchens , he knew , but he must be five floors above there . 
" You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section . " 
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face . 
Wherever he was , Filch must know a shortcut , because his soft , greasy voice was getting nearer , and to his horror , it was Snape who replied , " The Restricted Section ? 
Well , they can't be far , we ' ll catch them . " 
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead . 
It was his only hope . 
He squeezed through it , holding his breath , trying not to move it , and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything . 
It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in . 
It looked like an unused classroom . 
The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls , and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there , something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way . 
It was a magnificent mirror , as high as the ceiling , with an ornate gold frame , standing on two clawed feet . 
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape , Harry moved nearer to the mirror , wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again . 
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming . 
He whirled around . 
His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror , but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him . 
But the room was empty . 
Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still , no one was there . 
Or were they all invisible , too ? 
Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them , invisible or not ? 
He looked in the mirror again . 
A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving . 
He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him . 
If she was really there , he'd touch her , their reflections were so close together , but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror . 
She was a very pretty woman . 
She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine , Harry thought , edging a little closer to the glass . 
Bright green -- exactly the same shape , but then he noticed that she was crying ; smiling , but crying at the same time . 
The tall , thin , black - haired man standing next to her put his arm around her . 
He wore glasses , and his hair was very untidy . 
It stuck up at the back , just as Harry's did . 
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection . 
They just looked at him , smiling . 
And slowly , Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror , and saw other pairs of green eyes like his , other noses like his , even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family , for the first time in his life . 
How long he stood there , he didn't know . 
He couldn't stay here , he had to find his way back to bed . 
He tore his eyes away from his mother's face , whispered , " I ' ll come back , " and hurried from the room . 
" You could have woken me up , " said Ron , crossly . 
" You can come tonight , I'm going back , I want to show you the mirror . 
" I'd like to see your mom and dad , " Ron said eagerly . 
" And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you ' ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . " 
Have some bacon or something , why aren't you eating anything ? " 
Harry couldn't eat . 
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight . 
Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding ? 
What did it matter if Snape stole it , really ? 
" Are you all right ? " said Ron . " You look odd . " 
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again . 
With Ron covered in the cloak , too , they had to walk much more slowly the next night . 
They tried retracing Harry's route from the library , wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour . 
" I'm freezing , " said Ron . " Let's forget it and go back . " 
" No ! " Harry hissed . 
I know it's here somewhere . " 
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction , but saw no one else . 
" It's here -- just here -- yes ! " 
They pushed the door open . 
Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror . 
His mother and father beamed at the sight of him . 
" See ? " Harry whispered . 
" I can't see anything . " 
" Look ! Look at them all ... there are loads of them .... " 
" I can only see you . " 
" Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . " 
Harry stepped aside , but with Ron in front of the mirror , he couldn't see his family anymore , just Ron in his paisley pajamas . 
" Look at me ! " he said . 
" Can you see all your family standing around you ? " 
" No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head boy ! " 
" What ? " 
" I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain , too . 
" Do you think this mirror shows the future ? " 
" How can it ? 
All my family are dead -- let me have another look -- " 
I want to see my parents . " 
" Don't push me -- " 
They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking . 
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs . Norris came round the door . 
Ron and Harry stood quite still , both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats ? 
Come on . " 
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room . 
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning . 
" Want to play chess , Harry ? " said Ron . 
" No . " 
" No ... you go ... " 
" I know what you ' re thinking about , Harry , that mirror . 
Don't go back tonight . " 
" Why not ? " 
" I dunno , I ' ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway , you ' ve had too many close shaves already . 
Filch , Snape , and Mrs . Norris are wandering around . 
So what if they can't see you ? 
What if they walk into you ? 
" You sound like Hermione . " 
" I'm serious , Harry , don't go . " 
But Harry only had one thought in his head , which was to get back in front of the mirror , and Ron wasn't going to stop him . 
That third night he found his way more quickly than before . 
He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise , but he didn't meet anyone . 
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again , and one of his grandfathers nodding happily . 
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror . 
Nothing at all . 
Except - 
" So -- back again , Harry ? " 
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice . 
He looked behind him . 
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore . 
Harry must have walked straight past him , so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him . 
" -- I didn't see you , sir . " 
" So , " said Dumbledore , slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry , " you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . " 
" I didn't know it was called that , Sir . " 
" But I expect you ' ve realized by now what it does ? " 
" How did you know -- ? " 
" I don't need a cloak to become invisible , " said Dumbledore gently . 
Harry shook his head . 
" Let me explain . 
The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is . 
Does that help ? " 
Harry thought . 
Then he said slowly , " It shows us what we want ... whatever we want ... " 
" Yes and no , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts . 
You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you . 
Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them . 
" The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . 
If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . 
It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . 
Harry stood up . 
" Sir -- Professor Dumbledore ? 
Can I ask you something ? " 
" You may ask me one more thing , however . " 
" What do you see when you look in the mirror ? " 
" I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . " 
Harry stared . 
" One can never have enough socks , " said Dumbledore . " Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair . 
People will insist on giving me books . " 
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful . 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN : NICOLAS FLAMEL 
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again , and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk . 
Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily , but he couldn't . 
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li - brary book , even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere . 
Harry had even less time than the other two , because Quidditch practice had started again . 
The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic , but Harry was on Wood's side . 
If they won their next match , against Hufflepuff , they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years . 
Then , during one particularly wet and muddy practice session , Wood gave the team a bit of bad news . 
" That's exactly the sort of thing that ' ll lose us the match ! 
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words . 
" When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? 
He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . " 
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain , too . 
Which was all very well , thought Harry , but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch .... 
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice , but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room , where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess . 
Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at , something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her . 
" Don't talk to me for a moment , " said Ron when Harry sat down next to him , " I need to concen -- " He caught sight of Harry's face . 
" What's the matter with you ? 
You look terrible . " 
" Don't play , " said Hermione at once . 
" Say you ' re ill , " said Ron . 
" Pretend to break your leg , " Hermione suggested . 
" Really break your leg , " said Ron . 
" I can't , " said Harry . 
If I back out , 
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room . 
He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower . 
Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet , trembling . 
" What happened ? " 
Hermione asked him , leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron . 
" Malfoy , " said Neville shakily . 
" I met him outside the library . 
" Go to Professor McGonagall ! " Hermione urged Neville . 
Neville shook his head . 
" I don't want more trouble , " he mumbled . 
" You ' ve got to stand up to him , Neville ! " said Ron . " He's used to walking all over people , but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . " 
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog , the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas . 
He gave it to Neville , who looked as though he might cry . 
" You ' re worth twelve of Malfoy , " Harry said . 
And where's Malfoy ? 
Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog . 
" Thanks , Harry ... 
I think I ' ll go to bed .... D ' you want the card , you collect them , don't you ? " 
As Neville walked away , Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card . 
He gasped . 
He stared at the back of the card . 
Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione . 
" I ' ve found him ! " he whispered . 
" I ' ve found Flamel ! 
I told you I'd read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this : ' Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ' ! " 
Hermione jumped to her feet . 
" Stay there ! " she said , and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'dormitories . 
" I never thought to look in here ! " 
" I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . " 
" Light ? " said Ron , but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up , and started flicking frantically through the pages , muttering to herself . 
At last she found what she was looking for . 
" I knew it ! 
I knew it ! " 
" Are we allowed to speak yet ? " said Ron grumpily . 
Hermione ignored him . 
" Nicolas Flamel , " she whispered dramatically , " is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone ! " 
" The what ? " said Harry and Ron . 
" Oh , honestly , don't you two read ? 
Look -- read that , there . " 
She pushed the book toward them , and Harry and Ron read : The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone , a legendary substance with astonishing powers . 
The stone will transform any metal into pure gold . 
It also produces the Elixir of Life , which will make the drinker immortal . 
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries , but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr . Nicolas Flamel , the noted alchemist and opera lover . 
" See ? " said Hermione , when Harry and Ron had finished . 
I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they ' re friends and he knew someone was after it , that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! " 
" A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! " said Harry . 
" No wonder Snape's after it ! 
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts , while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites , Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one . 
" I'm going to play , " he told Ron and Hermione . 
" If I don't , all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape . 
" Just as long as we ' re not wiping you off the field , " said Hermione . 
As the match drew nearer , however , Harry became more and more nervous , whatever he told Ron and Hermione . 
Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not , but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went . 
Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds . 
Harry knew , when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon , that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again . 
Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand . 
Ron and Hermione , meanwhile , had found a place in the stands next to Neville , who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried , or why they had both brought their wands to the match . 
Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg - Locker Curse . 
" Now , don't forget , it's Locomotor Mortis , " Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve . 
" I know , " Ron snapped . 
Back in the locker room , Wood had taken Harry aside . 
" The whole school's out there ! " said Fred Weasley , peering out of the door . 
Harry's heart did a somersault . 
" Dumbledore ? " he said , dashing to the door to make sure . 
Fred was right . 
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field , something that Ron noticed , too . 
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head . 
It was Malfoy . 
" Oh , sorry , Weasley , didn't see you there . " 
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle . 
" Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time ? 
What about you , Weasley ? " 
Ron didn't answer ; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him . 
Hermione , who had all her fingers crossed in her lap , was squinting fixedly at Harry , who was circling the game like a hawk , looking for the Snitch . 
" I'm worth twelve of you , Malfoy , " he stammered . 
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry . 
" I'm warning you , Malfoy -- one more word 
" Ron ! " said Hermione suddenly , " Harry -- " 
" What ? 
Where ? " 
Hermione stood up , her crossed fingers in her mouth , as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet . 
Ron snapped . 
Before Malfoy knew what was happening , Ron was on top of him , wrestling him to the ground . 
" Come on , Harry ! " Hermione screamed , leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat , or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville , Crabbe , and Goyle . 
Up in the air , Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him , missing him by inches -- the next second , Harry had pulled out of the dive , his arm raised in triumph , the Snitch clasped in his hand . 
" Ron ! Ron ! 
Where are you ? 
The game's over ! 
Harry's won ! We ' ve won ! Gryffindor is in the lead ! " shrieked Hermione , dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front . 
Harry jumped off his broom , a foot from the ground . 
" Well done , " said Dumbledore quietly , so that only Harry could hear . 
Snape spat bitterly on the ground . 
Harry left the locker room alone some time later , to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed . 
The evening air had never smelled so sweet . 
He walked over the damp grass , reliving the last hour in his head , which was a happy blur : Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ; Ron and Hermione in the distance , jumping up and down , Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed . 
Harry had reached the shed . 
He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts , with its windows glowing red in the setting sun . 
Gryffindor in the lead . 
And speaking of Snape ... 
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle . 
Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched . 
He recognized the figure's prowling walk . 
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off . 
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run . 
He followed . 
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone . 
He climbed carefully along one of the branches , holding tight to his broomstick , trying to see through the leaves . 
Below , in a shadowy clearing , stood Snape , but he wasn't alone . 
Quirrell was there , too . 
Harry strained to catch what they were saying . 
" Oh , I thought we'd keep this private , " said Snape , his voice icy . 
Harry leaned forward . 
Snape interrupted him . 
" Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet ? " 
" I - I don't know what you 
" You know perfectly well what I mean . " 
An owl hooted loudly , and Harry nearly fell out of the tree . 
I'm waiting . " 
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing . 
It was almost dark now , but Harry could see Quirrell , standing quite still as though he was petrified . 
" Harry , where have you been ? " Hermione squeaked . 
" We won ! 
You won ! 
We won ! " shouted Ron , thumping Harry on the back . 
" And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single - handed ! 
Everyone's waiting for you in the common room , we ' re having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . " 
" Never mind that now , " said Harry breathlessly . 
" Let's find an empty room , you wait ' til you hear this .... " 
" So we were right , it is the Sorcerer's Stone , and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . 
He asked if he knew how to get past 
" So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? " said Hermione in alarm . 
" It ' ll be gone by next Tuesday , " said Ron . 
In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner , but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet . 
Every time they passed the third - floor corridor , Harry , Ron , and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside . 
Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded , but she kept nagging them to do the same . 
" Ten weeks , " Hermione snapped . 
" That's not ages , that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel . " 
" Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it A . " 
Are you crazy ? 
You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? 
Unfortunately , the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione . 
It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements . 
Moaning and yawning , Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her , trying to get through all their extra work . 
The sky was a clear , forget - me - not blue , and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming . 
What are you doing in the library ? " 
Hagrid shuffled into view , hiding something behind his back . 
He looked suddenly suspicious . 
" And we know what that dog's guarding , it's a Sorcerer's St -- " 
" Shhhh ! " Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening . 
" There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , " said Harry , " about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy -- " 
" SHHHH ! " said Hagrid again . 
" Listen - come an'see me later , I'm not promisin ' I ' ll tell yeh anythin ' , mind , but don ' go rabbitin ' about it in here , students aren's ' pposed ter know . 
" See you later , then , " said Harry . 
Hagrid shuffled off . 
" What was he hiding behind his back ? " said Hermione thoughtfully . 
" Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? " 
He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table . 
" Hagrid's always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , " said Harry . 
You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania . " 
" But there aren't wild dragons in Britain ? " said Harry . 
" So what on earths Hagrid up to ? " said Hermione . 
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later , they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed . 
Hagrid called " Who is it ? " 
before he let them in , and then shut the door quickly behind them . 
It was stifling hot inside . 
Even though it was such a warm day , there was a blazing fire in the grate . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
There was no point beating around the bush . 
" We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy . " 
Hagrid frowned at him . 
" 0 ' course I cant , he said . 
" Number one , I don ' know meself . 
Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn'tell yeh if I could . 
It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s ' ppose yeh ' ve worked that out an ' all ? 
" Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here , " said Hermione in a warm , flattering voice . 
Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling . 
Hermione went on . 
Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione . 
" Well , I don's ' pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... let's see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some o ' the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall -- " he ticked them off on his fingers , " Professor Quirrell -- an ' Dumbledore himself did somethin ' , o ' course . 
Oh yeah , Professor Snape . " 
" Snape ? " 
Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he's not about ter steal it . " 
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was . 
If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone , it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it . 
He probably knew everything - except , it seemed , Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy . 
" You ' re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy . 
aren't you , Hagrid ? " said Harry anxiously . 
" And you wouldn't tell anyone , would you ? 
Not even one of the teachers ? " 
" Well , that's something , " Harry muttered to the others . 
" Hagrid , can we have a window open ? 
I'm boiling . " 
" Can't , Harry , sorry , " said Hagrid . 
Harry noticed him glance at the fire . 
Harry looked at it , too . 
" Hagrid -- what's that ? " 
But he already knew what it was . 
In the very heart of the fire , underneath the kettle , was a huge , black egg . 
" Won it , " said Hagrid . 
I was down in the village havin ' a few drinks an ' got into a game o ' cards with a stranger . 
" But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched ? " said Hermione . 
" Well , I ' ve bin doin'some readin ' , said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow . 
" Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date , o ' course , but it's all in here . 
Keep the egg in the fire , ' cause their mothers breathe on I em , see , an ' when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour . 
They're rare , them . " 
He looked very pleased with himself , but Hermione didn't . 
" Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , " she said . 
But Hagrid wasn't listening . 
So now they had something else to worry about : what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut . 
Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron , too . 
It was driving them nuts . 
Then , one breakfast time , Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid . 
He had written only two words : It's hatching . 
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut . 
" We ' ve got lessons , we ' ll get into trouble , and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing -- " 
" Shut up ! " Harry whispered . 
Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all . 
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end , Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break . 
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson , the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest . 
Hagrid greeted them , looking flushed and excited . 
" It's nearly out . " 
He ushered them inside . 
The egg was lying on the table . 
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open . 
The baby dragon flopped onto the table . 
It wasn't exactly pretty ; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled , black umbrella . 
It sneezed . 
A couple of sparks flew out of its snout . 
Hagrid murmured . 
He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head . 
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window . 
" What's the matter ? " 
" Someone was lookin'through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid - he's runnin ' back up ter the school . " 
Harry bolted to the door and looked out . 
Malfoy had seen the dragon . 
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry , Ron , and Hermione very nervous . 
They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut , trying to reason with him . 
" I can't , " said Hagrid . 
" He's too little . 
They looked at the dragon . 
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor . 
" I ' ve decided to call him Norbert , " said Hagrid , looking at the dragon with misty eyes . 
Norbert ! 
Norbert ! 
Where's Mommy ? " 
" He's lost his marbles , " Ron muttered in Harry's ear . 
" Hagrid , " said Harry loudly , " give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house . 
Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . " 
Hagrid bit his lip . 
" I -- I know I can't keep him forever , but I can't jus'dump him , I can't . " 
Harry suddenly turned to Ron . 
Charlie , he said . 
" You ' re losing it , too , " said Ron . " I'm Ron , remember ? " 
" No -- Charlie -- your brother , Charlie . 
We could send Norbert to him . 
" Brilliant ! " said Ron . " How about it , Hagrid ? " 
And in the end , Hagrid agreed that they could send - an owl to Charlie to ask him . 
Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room , long after everyone else had gone to bed . 
The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open . 
Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak . 
He had been down at Hagrid's hut , helping him feed Norbert , who was now eating dead rats by the crate . 
" It bit me ! " he said , showing them his hand , which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief . 
" I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . 
I tell you , that dragon's the most horrible animal I ' ve ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . 
When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . 
And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . " 
There was a tap on the dark window . 
" It's Hedwig ! " said Harry , hurrying to let her in . 
The three of them put their heads together to read the note . 
Dear Ron , 
How are you ? 
I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week . 
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday ? 
Send me an answer as soon as possible . 
Love , 
Charlie 
They looked at one another . 
" We ' ve got the invisibility cloak , " said Harry . 
" It shouldn't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . " 
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him . 
There was a hitch . 
By the next morning , Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size . 
He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite ? 
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed . 
" It's not just my hand , " he whispered , " although that feels like it's about to fall off . 
He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I ' ve told her it was a dog , but I don't think she believes me - I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match , that's why he's doing this . " 
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down . 
" Midnight on Saturday ! " he said in a hoarse voice . 
" Oh no oh no -- I ' ve just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took , he's going to know we ' re getting rid of Norbert . " 
Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer . 
" It's too late to change the plan now , " Harry told Hermione . 
We ' ll have to risk it . 
They found Fang , the boarhound , sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid , who opened a window to talk to them . 
The baby banged its tail on the wall , making the windows rattle . 
Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough . 
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good - bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do . 
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate . 
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off . 
" Bye - bye , Norbert ! " Hagrid sobbed , as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves . 
" Mommy will never forget you ! " 
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle , they never knew . 
Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors . 
" Nearly there ! " 
Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower . 
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate . 
Forgetting that they were already invisible , they shrank into the shadows , staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away . 
A lamp flared . 
Professor McGonagall , in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net , had Malfoy by the ear . 
" And twenty points from Slytherin ! 
Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you -- " 
Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon ! " 
" What utter rubbish ! 
Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! " 
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that . 
Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak , glad to be able to breathe properly again . 
" Malfoy's got detention ! 
I could sing ! " 
About ten minutes later , four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness . 
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much . 
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs . 
As they stepped into the corridor , Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness . 
They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower . 
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor , where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other . 
Hermione was trembling . 
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak ? 
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night , let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower , which was out - of - bounds except for classes . 
He was wrong . 
When Professor McGonagall appeared , she was leading Neville . 
" Harry ! " Neville burst Out , the moment he saw the other two . 
" I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag -- " 
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up , but Professor McGonagall had seen . 
She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them . 
" I would never have believed it of any of you . 
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question . 
She was staring at her slippers , as still as a statue . 
" I think I ' ve got a good idea of what's been going on , " said Professor McGonagall . 
You fed Draco Malfoy some cock - and - bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . 
I ' ve already caught him . 
I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? " 
Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true , because Neville was looking stunned and hurt . 
Poor , blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark , to warn them . 
" I'm disgusted , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Four students out of bed in one night ! 
I ' ve never heard of such a thing before ! 
As for you , Mr . Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . 
" Fifty ? " 
Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead , the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match . 
" Fifty points each , " said Professor McGonagall , breathing heavily through her long , pointed nose . 
" Professor -- please 
" You can't -- " 
Now get back to bed , all of you . 
A hundred and fifty points lost . 
That put Gryffindor in last place . 
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach . 
Harry didn't sleep all night . 
Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him . 
He knew Neville , like himself , was dreading the dawn . 
What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done ? 
At first , Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake . 
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday ? 
And then the story started to spread : Harry Potter , the famous Harry Potter , their hero of two Quidditch matches , had lo st them all those points , him and a couple of other stupid first years . 
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school , Harry was suddenly the most hated . 
Only Ron stood by him . 
" They ' ll all forget this in a few weeks . 
" They ' ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? " said Harry miserably . 
" Well -- no , " Ron admitted . 
It was a bit late to repair the damage , but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on . 
He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team . 
" Resign ? " Wood thundered . 
" What good ' ll that do ? 
How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch ? " 
Hermione and Neville were suffering , too . 
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away . 
All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery . 
He , Ron , and Hermione kept to themselves , working late into the night , trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions , learn charms and spells by heart , memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions .... 
Then , about a week before the exams were due to start , Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test . 
" No -- no -- not again , please -- " 
Harry moved closer . 
" All right -- all right -- " he heard Quirrell sob . 
Next second , Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban . 
He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry . 
It was empty , but a door stood ajar at the other end . 
Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling . 
Harry went back to the library , where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy . 
" There's still Fluffy , though , " said Hermione . 
" Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , " said Ron , looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them . 
" I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three - headed dog . 
So what do we do , Harry ? " 
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes , but Hermione answered before Harry could . 
" Go to Dumbledore . 
" But we ' ve got no proof ! " said Harry . 
" Quirrell's too scared to back us up . 
Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they ' ll believe , him or us ? 
And don't forget , we ' re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . 
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons . 
The following morning , notes were delivered to Harry , Hermione , and Neville at the breakfast table . 
They were all the same : 
Your detention will take place at eleven o ' clock tonight . 
Meet Mr . Filch in the entrance hall . 
Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost . 
He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost , but she didn't say a word . 
Like Harry , she felt they deserved what they'd got . 
At eleven o ' clock that night , they said good - bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville . 
Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy . 
Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention , too . 
Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be . 
It must be something really horrible , or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted . 
Ahead , Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut . 
Then they heard a distant shout . 
" Is that you , Filch ? 
Hurry up , I want ter get started . " 
" We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves , I heard . " 
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise . 
" That's your problem , isn't it ? " said Filch , his voice cracking with glee . 
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark , Fang at his heel . 
He was carrying his large crossbow , and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder . 
" Abou ' time , " he said . 
" I bin waitin ' fer half an hour already . 
All right , Harry , Hermione ? " 
" That's why yer late , is it ? " said Hagrid , frowning at Filch . 
" I ' ll be back at dawn , " said Filch , " for what's left of them , " he added nastily , and he turned and started back toward the castle , his lamp bobbing away in the darkness . 
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid . 
" I'm not going in that forest , he said , and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice . 
" But this is servant stuff , it's not for students to do . 
What good's that ter anyone ? 
Go on " ' 
Malfoy didn't move . 
He looked at Hagrid furiously , but then dropped his gaze . 
He led them to the very edge of the forest . 
A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest . 
That's unicorn blood . 
This is the second time in a week . 
I found one dead last Wednesday . 
" And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? " said Malfoy , unable to keep the fear out of his voice . 
" I want Fang , " said Malfoy quickly , looking at Fang's long teeth . 
The forest was black and silent . 
A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path , and Harry , Hermione , and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy , Neville , and Fang took the right . 
They walked in silence , their eyes on the ground . 
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver - blue blood on the fallen leaves . 
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried . 
Harry asked . 
" Not fast enough , " said Hagrid . 
I never knew one ter be hurt before . " 
They walked past a mossy tree stump . 
" You all right , Hermione ? " 
Hagrid whispered . 
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak . 
He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow , raising it , ready to fire . 
The three of them listened . 
Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby : it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground . 
Hagrid was squinting up the dark path , but after a few seconds , the sound faded away . 
" I knew it , " he murmured . 
" There's summat in here that shouldn ' be . " 
" A werewolf ? " 
Harry suggested . 
" That wasn ' no werewolf an ' it wasn ' no unicorn , neither , " said Hagrid grimly . 
" Right , follow me , but careful , now . " 
" Who's there ? " 
Hagrid called . 
" Show yerself -- I'm armed ! " 
And into the clearing came -- was it a man , or a horse ? 
To the waist , a man , with red hair and beard , but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long , reddish tail . 
Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped . 
" Oh , it's you , Ronan , " said Hagrid in relief . 
He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand . 
" Good evening to you , Hagrid , " said Ronan . 
He had a deep , sorrowful voice . 
" Were you going to shoot me ? " 
This is Harry Potter an ' Hermione Granger , by the way . 
Students up at the school . 
An'this is Ronan , you two . 
He's a centaur . )) 
" We'd noticed , " said Hermione faintly . 
" Good evening , " said Ronan . 
" Students , are you ? 
" A bit , " said Hermione timidly . 
" A bit . 
Well , that's something . " 
Ronan sighed . 
He flung back his head and stared at the sky . 
" Mars is bright tonight . " 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid , glancing up , too . 
He stared unblinkingly upward , then sighed again . 
" Always the innocent are the first victims , " he said . 
" So it has been for ages past , so it is now . " 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid , " but have yeh seen anythin ' , Ronan ? 
" Mars is bright tonight , " Ronan repeated , while Hagrid watched him impatiently . 
At last , he said , " The forest hides many secrets . " 
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again , but it was only a second centaur , black - haired and - bodied and wilder - looking than Ronan . 
" Hullo , Bane , " said Hagrid . 
" All right ? " 
" Good evening , Hagrid , I hope you are well ? " 
" Well enough . 
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan . 
He looked skyward . 
" Mars is bright tonight , " he said simply . 
" We ' ve heard , " said Hagrid grumpily . 
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing , staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view . 
" Never , " said Hagrid irritably , " try an ' get a straight answer out of a centaur . 
asked Hermione . 
They walked on through the dense , dark trees . 
Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder . 
He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them . 
" Hagrid ! Look ! Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! " 
" You two wait here ! " 
Hagrid shouted . 
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other , very scared , until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them . 
whispered Hermione . 
" I don't care if Malfoy has , but if something's got Neville ... it's our fault he's here in the first place . " 
What was going on ? 
Where were the others ? 
Malfoy , Neville , and Fang were with him . 
Hagrid was fuming . 
Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks . 
Right , we ' re changin ' groups -- Neville , you stay with me an ' Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an'this idiot . 
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang . 
They walked for nearly half an hour , deeper and deeper into the forest , until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick . 
Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker . 
There were splashes on the roots of a tree , as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by . 
Harry could see a clearing ahead , through the tangled branches of an ancient oak . 
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground . 
They inched closer . 
It was the unicorn all right , and it was dead . 
Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad . 
A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered .... 
Then , out of the shadows , a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast . 
Harry , Malfoy , and Fang stood transfixed . 
The cloaked figure reached the unicorn , lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side , and began to drink its blood . 
Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head ; it was as though his scar were on fire . 
He heard hooves behind him , galloping , and something jumped clean over Harry , charging at the figure . 
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees . 
It took a minute or two to pass . 
When he looked up , the figure had gone . 
" Are you all right ? " said the centaur , pulling Harry to his feet . 
" Yes -- thank you -- what was that ? " 
The centaur didn't answer . 
He looked carefully at Harry , his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out , livid , on Harry's forehead . 
" You are the Potter boy , " he said . 
" You had better get back to Hagrid . 
The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you . 
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing . 
Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees , their flanks heaving and sweaty . 
" Firenze ! " Bane thundered . 
" What are you doing ? 
You have a human on your back ! 
Have you no shame ? 
Are you a common mule ? " 
" This is the Potter boy . 
" What have you been telling him ? " 
growled Bane . 
" Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . 
Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? " 
" For the best ! 
What is that to do with us ? 
It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! " 
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger , so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on . 
" Do you not see that unicorn ? " Firenze bellowed at Bane . " Do you not understand why it was killed ? 
Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? 
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on . 
" Why's Bane so angry ? " he asked . 
Firenze slowed to a walk , warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low - hanging branches , but did not answer Harry's question . 
They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore . 
" Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used - for ? " 
" No , " said Harry , startled by the odd question . 
" We ' ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . " 
" That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , " said Firenze . 
" Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . 
The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . 
Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head , which was dappled silver in the moonlight . 
" It is , " Firenze agreed , " unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die . 
Mr . Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? " 
Of course -- the Elixir of Life ! 
But I don't understand who -- " 
" Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? " 
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart . 
Over the rustling of the trees , he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met : " Some say he died . 
Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . " 
" Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? " 
Hermione was running toward them down the path , Hagrid puffing along behind her . 
" I'm fine , " said Harry , hardly knowing what he was saying . 
" The unicorn's dead , Hagrid , it's in that clearing back there . " 
Harry slid off his back . 
" Good luck , Harry Potter , " said Firenze . 
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest , leaving Harry shivering behind him . 
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room , waiting for them to return . 
In a matter of seconds , though , he was wide - eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest . 
Harry couldn't sit down . 
He paced up and down in front of the fire . 
He was still shaking . 
" Snape wants the stone for Voldemort ... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest ... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich .... " 
" Stop saying the name ! " said Ron in a terrified whisper , as if he thought Voldemort could hear them . 
Harry wasn't listening . 
" Firenze saved me , but he shouldn't have done so .... Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen .... 
They must show that Voldemort's coming back .... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me .... 
I suppose that's written in the stars as well . " 
" So all I ' ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , " Harry went on feverishly , " then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well , I suppose Bane ' ll be happy . " 
Hermione looked very frightened , but she had a word of comfort . 
Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? 
They went to bed exhausted , their throats sore . 
When Harry pulled back his sheets , he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them . 
There was a note pinned to it : 
Yet the days crept by , and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door . 
Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk . 
Snape made them all nervous , breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion . 
Harry did the best he could , trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead , which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest . 
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep , but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare , except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it . 
Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest , or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads , but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry . 
The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them , but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams , and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to . 
Their very last exam was History of Magic . 
When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment , Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest . 
" I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . " 
The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid , which was basking in the warm shallows . 
Harry was rubbing his forehead . 
" I wish I knew what this means ! " he burst out angrily . 
" My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before , but never as often as this . " 
" Go to Madam Pomfrey , " Hermione suggested . 
" I'm not ill , " said Harry . 
" I think it's a warning ... it means danger's coming .... " 
" Harry , relax , Hermione's right , the Stone's safe as long as 
Dumbledore's around . 
Harry nodded , but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do , something important . 
When he tried to explain this , Hermione said , " That's just the exams . 
He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky , a note clamped in its mouth . 
Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy ... never ... but - 
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet . 
" Where ' re you going ? " said Ron sleepily . 
" I ' ve just thought of something , " said Harry . 
He had turned white . 
" We ' ve got to go and see Hagrid , now . " 
" Don't you think it's a bit odd , " said Harry , scrambling up the grassy slope , " that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ? 
Lucky they found Hagrid , don't you think ? 
Why didn't I see it before ? " 
" What are you talking about ? " said Ron , but Harry , sprinting across the grounds toward the forest , didn't answer . 
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house ; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up , and he was shelling peas into a large bowl . 
" Hullo , " he said , smiling . 
" Finished yer exams ? 
" Yes , please , " said Ron , but Harry cut him off . 
" No , we ' re in a hurry . 
Hagrid , I ' ve got to ask you something . 
You know that night you won Norbert ? 
What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? " 
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows . 
" It's not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hog's Head - that's the pub down in the village . 
I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . " 
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas . 
" What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ? 
Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? " 
" Yeah ... he asked what I did , an ' I told him I was gamekeeper here .... 
He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after ... so I told him ... an ' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon ... an'then ... 
I can ' remember too well , ' cause he kept buyin ' me drinks .... Let's see ... yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ' we could play cards fer it if I wanted ... but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ' want it ter go ter any old home .... 
" And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy ? " 
Harry asked , try ing to keep his voice calm . 
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified . 
" Forget I said it ! 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall , which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds . 
" We ' ve got to go to Dumbledore , " said Harry . 
Where's Dumbledore's office ? " 
They looked around , as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction . 
" We ' ll just have to -- " Harry began , but a voice suddenly rang across the hall . 
" What are you three doing inside ? " 
It was Professor McGonagall , carrying a large pile of books . 
" We want to see Professor Dumbledore , " said Hermione , rather bravely , Harry and Ron thought . 
" See Professor Dumbledore ? " Professor McGonagall repeated , as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do . 
" Why ? " 
Harry swallowed -- now what ? 
" Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago , " she said coldly . 
" He's gone ? " said Harry frantically . 
" Now ? " 
" Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time - 
" But this is important . " 
" Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter . 
" Look , " said Harry , throwing caution to the winds , " Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone -- " 
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected , it wasn't that . 
" How do you know -- ? " she spluttered . 
" Professor , I think -- I know -- that Sn - that someone's going to try and steal the Stone . 
I ' ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore . " 
" Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow , " she said finally . 
I don't know how you found out about the Stone , but rest assured , no one can possibly steal it , it's too well protected . " 
" But Professor -- " 
" Potter , I know what I'm talking about , " she said shortly . 
I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine . " 
But they didn't . 
" It's tonight , " said Harry , once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot . 
" Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight . 
He's found out everything he needs , and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way . 
" But what can we -- " 
Hermione gasped . 
Harry and Ron wheeled round . 
Snape was standing there . 
They stared at him . 
" You want to be more careful , " said Snape . 
" Hanging around like this , people will think you ' re up to something . 
Harry flushed . 
They turned to go outside , but Snape called them back . 
Good day to you . " 
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom . 
Out on the stone steps , Harry turned to the others . 
Hermione , you'd better do that . " 
" Why me ? " 
" It's obvious , " said Ron . " You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know . " 
He put on a high voice , " ' Oh Professor Flitwick , I'm so worried , I think I got question fourteen b wrong .... ' " 
" And we'd better stay outside the third - floor corridor , " Harry told Ron . " Come on . " 
But that part of the plan didn't work . 
No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time , she lost her temper . 
" I suppose you think you ' re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments ! " 
Harry and Ron went back to the common room , Harry had just said , " At least Hermione's on Snape's tail , " when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in . 
" I'm sorry , Harry ! " she wailed . 
" Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I ' ve only just got away , I don't know where Snape went . " 
" Well , that's it then , isn't it ? " 
Harry said . 
The other two stared at him . 
He was pale and his eyes were glittering . 
" I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first . " 
" You ' re mad ! " said Ron . 
" You can't ! " said Hermione . 
" After what McGonagall and Snape have said ? 
You ' ll be expelled ! " 
" SO WHAP " Harry shouted . 
" Don't you understand ? 
If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort's coming back ! 
Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ? 
If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I ' ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it's only dying a bit later than I would have , because I'm never going over to the Dark Side ! 
I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me ! 
Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? " 
He glared at them . 
" You ' re right Harry , " said Hermione in a small voice . 
" I ' ll use the invisibility cloak , " said Harry . 
" It's just lucky I got it back . " 
" But will it cover all three of us ? " said Ron . 
" All -- all three of us ? " 
" Oh , come off it , you don't think we'd let you go alone ? " 
" Of course not , " said Hermione briskly . 
" How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us ? 
" But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . " 
" Not if I can help it , " said Hermione grimly . 
" Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam . 
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room . 
Nobody bothered them ; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more , after all . 
Hermione was skimming through all her notes , hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break . 
Harry and Ron didn't talk much . 
Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do . 
He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas . 
He ran back down to the common room . 
" What are you doing ? " said a voice from the corner of the room . 
Neville appeared from behind an armchair , clutching Trevor the toad , who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom . 
" Nothing , Neville , nothing , " said Harry , hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back . 
Neville stared at their guilty faces . 
" No , no , no , " said Hermione . 
" No , we ' re not . 
Why don't you go to bed , Neville ? " 
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door . 
" You can't go out , " said Neville , " you ' ll be caught again . 
" You don't understand , " said Harry , " this is important . " 
" I ' ll -- I ' ll fight you ! " 
" Neville , " Ron exploded , " get away from that hole and don't be an idiot -- " 
I don't think you should be breaking any more rules ! 
And you were the one who told me to stand up to people ! " 
" Yes , but not to us , " said Ron in exasperation . 
" Neville , you don't know what you ' re doing . " 
" Go on then , try and hit me ! " said Neville , raising his fists . 
" I'm ready ! " 
Harry turned to Hermione . 
" Do something , " he said desperately . 
Hermione stepped forward . 
" Neville , " she said , " I'm really , really sorry about this . " 
She raised her wand . 
" Petrificus Totalus ! " she cried , pointing it at Neville . 
Neville's arms snapped to his sides . 
" What ' ve you done to him ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" It's the full Body - Bind , " said Hermione miserably . 
" Oh , Neville , I'm so sorry . " 
" We had to , Neville , no time to explain , " said Harry . 
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen . 
In their nervous state , every statue's shadow looked like Filch , every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them . 
At the foot of the first set of stairs , they spotted Mrs . Norris skulking near the top . 
" Oh , let's kick her , just this once , " Ron whispered in Harry's ear , but Harry shook his head . 
As they climbed carefully around her , Mrs . Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them , but didn't do anything . 
They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor . 
" Know you ' re there , even if I can't see you . 
Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? " 
He rose up in the air and floated there , squinting at them . 
Harry had a sudden idea . 
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock . 
He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs . 
" I have business here , Peeves , " croaked Harry . 
" Stay away from this place tonight . " 
" I will , sir , I most certainly will , " said Peeves , rising up in the air again . 
And he scooted off 
" Brilliant , Harry ! " whispered Ron . 
A few seconds later , they were there , outside the third - floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar . 
Underneath the cloak , Harry turned to the other two . 
" If you want to go back , I won't blame you , " he said . 
" You can take the cloak , I won't need it now . " 
" Don't be stupid , " said Ron . 
" We're coming , " said Hermione . 
Harry pushed the door open . 
All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction , even though it couldn't see them . 
" What's that at its feet ? " 
Hermione whispered . 
" Looks like a harp , " said Ron . " Snape must have left it there . " 
" Well , here goes ... " 
He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew . 
It wasn't really a tune , but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop . 
Harry hardly drew breath . 
Slowly , the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees , then it slumped to the ground , fast asleep . 
" Keep playing , " Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor . 
They could feel the dog's hot , smelly breath as they approached the giant heads . 
" I think we ' ll be able to pull the door open , " said Ron , peering over the dog's back . 
" Want to go first , Hermione ? " 
" No , I don't ! " 
" All right . " 
Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs . 
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor , which swung up and open . 
" What can you see ? " Hermione said anxiously . 
Harry , who was still playing the flute , waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself . 
" You want to go first ? 
Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . " 
Harry handed the flute over . 
In the few seconds'silence , the dog growled and twitched , but the moment Hermione began to play , it fell back into its deep sleep . 
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor . 
There was no sign of the bottom . 
Then he looked up at Ron and said , " If anything happens to me , don't follow . 
Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? " 
" Right , " said Ron . 
" See you in a minute , I hope ... 
And Harry let go . 
Cold , damp air rushed past him as he fell down , down , down and -- FLUMP . 
With a funny , muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft . 
He sat up and felt around , his eyes not used to the gloom . 
" It's okay ! " he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp , which was the open trapdoor , " it's a soft landing , you can jump ! " 
Ron followed right away . 
He landed , sprawled next to Harry . 
" What's this stuff ? " 
were his first words . 
I suppose it's here to break the fall . 
Come on , Hermione ! " 
There was a loud bark from the dog , but Hermione had already jumped . 
She landed on Harry's other side . 
" Lucky this plant thing's here , really , " said Ron . 
" Lucky ! " shrieked Hermione . 
" Look at you both ! " 
She had to struggle because the moment she had landed , the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles . 
Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them , but the more they strained against it , the tighter and faster the plant wound around them . 
Hermione ordered them . 
" I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare ! " 
" Shut up , I'm trying to remember how to kill it ! " said Hermione . 
" Well , hurry up , I can't breathe ! " 
Harry gasped , wrestling with it as it curled around his chest . 
" So light a fire ! " 
Harry choked . 
Hermione cried , wringing her hands . 
" ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? " 
In a matter of seconds , the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth . 
" This way , " said Harry , pointing down a stone passageway , which was the only way forward . 
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls . 
With an unpleasant jolt of the heart , he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards ' bank . 
If they met a dragon , a fully - grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough ... 
" Can you hear something ? " 
Ron whispered . 
Harry listened . 
" Do you think it's a ghost ? " 
" I don't know ... sounds like wings to me . " 
" There's light ahead -- I can see something moving . " 
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber , its ceiling arching high above them . 
On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door . 
" Probably , " said Harry . 
" They don't look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once ... well , there's no other choice ... I ' ll run . " 
He took a deep breath , covered his face with his arms , and sprinted across the room . 
He reached the door untouched . 
He pulled the handle , but it was locked . 
The other two followed him . 
They tugged and heaved at the door , but it wouldn't budge , not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm . 
" Now what ? " said Ron . 
Harry said suddenly . 
So that must mean ... " he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys . 
" ... yes -- look ! 
We ' ve got to catch the key to the door ! " 
" But there are hundreds of them ! " 
Ron examined the lock on the door . 
" We're looking for a big , old - fashioned one -- probably silver , like the handle . " 
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air , soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys . 
After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers , he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing , as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole . 
" That one ! " he called to the others . 
" That big one -- there -- no , there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side . " 
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing , crashed into the ceiling , and nearly fell off his broom . 
" We ' ve got to close in on it ! " 
Harry called , not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing . 
" Ron , you come at it from above -- Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I ' ll try and catch it . 
Ron dived , Hermione rocketed upward , the key dodged them both , and Harry streaked after it ; it sped toward the wall , Harry leaned forward and with a nasty , crunching noise , pinned it against the stone with one hand . 
Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber . 
They landed quickly , and Harry ran to the door , the key struggling in his hand . 
He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked . 
" Ready ? " 
Harry asked the other two , his hand on the door handle . 
They nodded . 
He pulled the door open . 
The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all . 
But as they stepped into it , light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight . 
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard , behind the black chessmen , which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone . 
Facing them , way across the chamber , were the white pieces . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces . 
" Now what do we do ? " 
Harry whispered . 
Behind the white pieces they could see another door . 
" How ? " said Hermione nervously . 
" I think , " said Ron , " we ' re going to have to be chessmen . " 
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse . 
At once , the stone sprang to life . 
The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron . 
" Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across ? " 
The black knight nodded . 
Ron turned to the other two . 
" This needs thinking about he said . 
I suppose we ' ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces .... " 
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet , watching Ron think . 
Finally he said , " Now , don't be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess -- " 
" We're not offended , " said Harry quickly . 
" Just tell us what to do . " 
" Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle . " 
" What about you ? " 
" I'm going to be a knight , " said Ron . 
The chessmen seemed to have been listening , because at these words a knight , a bishop , and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board , leaving three empty squares that Harry , Ron , and Hermione took . 
" Yes ... look ... " 
Ron started to direct the black pieces . 
Harry's knees were trembling . 
What if they lost ? 
" Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right . " 
The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board , where he lay quite still , facedown . 
" Had to let that happen , " said Ron , looking shaken . 
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall . 
Twice , Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger . 
" Let me think let me think ... " 
" NOF Harry and Hermione shouted . 
" That's chess ! " snapped Ron . 
" But -- " 
" Do you want to stop Snape or not ? " 
" Ron -- " 
There was no alternative . 
" Ready ? " Ron called , his face pale but determined . 
He stepped forward , and the white queen pounced . 
She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm , and he crashed to the floor Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side . 
He looked as if he'd been knocked out . 
Shaking , Harry moved three spaces to the left . 
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet . 
With one last desperate look back at Ron , Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway . 
" What if he's -- ? " 
" He ' ll be all right , " said Harry , trying to convince himself . 
" What do you reckon's next ? " 
" We ' ve had Sprout's , that was the Devil's Snare ; Flitwick must ' ve put charms on the keys ; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive ; that leaves Quirrell's spell , and Snape's . " 
" All right ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" Go on . " 
Harry pushed it open . 
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils , making both of them pull their robes up over their noses . 
Eyes watering , they saw , flat on the floor in front of them , a troll even larger than the one they had tackled , out cold with a bloody lump on its head . 
" Come on , I can't breathe . " 
" Snape's , " said Harry . 
" What do we have to do ? " 
They stepped over the threshold , and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway . 
At the same instant , black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward . 
" Look ! " Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles . 
Harry looked over her shoulder to read it : 
Third , as you see clearly , all are different size , 
Fourth , the second left and the second on the right 
" Brilliant , " said Hermione . 
" Everything we need is here on this paper . 
" But how do we know which to drink ? " 
" Give me a minute . " 
Hermione read the paper several times . 
Then she walked up and down the line of bottles , muttering to herself and pointing at them . 
At last , she clapped her hands . 
" Got it , " she said . 
" The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone . " 
Harry looked at the tiny bottle . 
" That's hardly one swallow . " 
They looked at each other . 
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line . 
" You drink that , " said Harry . 
Grab brooms from the flying - key room , they ' ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him . 
I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I'm no match for him , really . " 
" But Harry -- what if You - Know - Who's with him ? " 
" Well -- I was lucky once , wasn't I ? " said Harry , pointing at his scar . 
" I might get lucky again . " 
Hermione's lip trembled , and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him . 
" Hermione ! " 
" Harry -- you ' re a great wizard , you know . " 
" I'm not as good as you , " said Harry , very embarrassed , as she let go of him . 
" Me ! " said Hermione . 
And cleverness ! 
There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful ! " 
" You drink first , " said Harry . 
" Positive , " said Hermione . 
She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end , and shuddered . 
" It's not poison ? " said Harry anxiously . 
" No -- but it's like ice . " 
" Good luck -- take care . " 
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire . 
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle . 
He turned to face the black flames . 
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body . 
He put the bottle down and walked forward ; he braced himself , saw the black flames licking his body , but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side , in the last chamber . 
It was Quirrell . 
" You ! " gasped Harry . 
Quirrell smiled . 
His face wasn't twitching at all . 
" Me , " he said calmly . 
" I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here , Potter . " 
" But I thought -- Snape -- " 
" But Snape tried to kill me ! " 
" No , no , no . 
I tried to kill you . 
" Snape was trying to save me ? " 
" Of course , " said Quirrell coolly . 
" \ Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ? 
He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again . 
I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching . 
All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning , he did make himself unpopular ... and what a waste of time , when after all that , I'm going to kill you tonight . " 
Quirrell snapped his fingers . 
Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . " 
" You let the troll in ? " 
I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ? 
Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three - headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly . 
I need to examine this interesting mirror . 
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell . 
It was the Mirror of Erised . 
" This mirror is the key to finding the Stone , " Quirrell murmured , tapping his way around the frame . 
" Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this ... but he's in London ... I ' ll be far away by the time he gets back .... " 
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror . 
" I saw you and Snape in the forest -- " he blurted out . 
" Yes , " said Quirrell idly , walking around the mirror to look at the back . 
" He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I'd got . 
He suspected me all along . 
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it . 
" I see the Stone ... I'm presenting it to my master ... but where is it ? " 
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror . 
" But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . " 
" Oh , he does , " said Quirrell casually , " heavens , yes . 
They loathed each other . 
" But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you .... " 
For the first time , a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face . 
" You mean he was there in the classroom with you ? " 
Harry gasped . 
" He is with me wherever I go , " said Quirrell quietly . 
" I met him when I traveled around the world . 
A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil . 
There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seek it .... Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times . 
He has had to be very hard on me . " 
Quirrell shivered suddenly . 
" He does not forgive mistakes easily . 
When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased . 
He punished me ... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me .... " 
Quirrell's voice trailed away . 
He'd seen Quirrell there that very day , shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron . 
" I don't understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror ? 
Should I break it ? " 
Harry's mind was racing . 
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment , he thought , is to find the Stone before Quirrell does . 
So if I look in the mirror , I should see myseff finding it -- which means I ' ll see where it's hidden ! 
But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to ? 
He tried to edge to the left , to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing , but the ropes around his ankles were too tight : he tripped and fell over . 
Quirrell ignored him . 
He was still talking to himself . 
" What does this mirror do ? 
How does it work ? 
Help me , Master ! " 
And to Harry's horror , a voice answered , and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself 
" Use the boy ... Use the boy ... " 
Quirrell rounded on Harry . 
" Yes -- Potter -- come here . " 
He clapped his hands once , and the ropes binding Harry fell off . 
Harry got slowly to his feet . 
" Come here , " Quirrell repeated . 
" Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . " 
Harry walked toward him . 
I must look and lie about what I see , that's all . 
Quirrell moved close behind him . 
Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban . 
He closed his eyes , stepped in front of the mirror , and opened them again . 
But a moment later , the reflection smiled at him . 
It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood - red stone . 
" Well ? " said Quirrell impatiently . 
" What do you see ? " 
Harry screwed up his courage . 
" I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore , " he invented . 
" I -- I ' ve won the house cup for Gryffindor . " 
Quirrell cursed again . 
" Get out of the way , " he said . 
As Harry moved aside , he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg . 
" He lies ... 
He lies ... " 
" Potter , come back here ! " 
Quirrell shouted . 
What did you just see ? " 
The high voice spoke again . 
" Let me speak to him ... face - to - face ... " 
" Master , you are not strong enough ! " 
" I have strength enough ... for this .... " 
Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot . 
He couldn't move a muscle . 
What was going on ? 
The turban fell away . 
Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it . 
Then he turned slowly on the spot . 
Harry would have screamed , but he couldn't make a sound . 
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head , there was a face , the most terrible face Harry had ever seen . 
It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils , like a snake . 
" Harry Potter ... " it whispered . 
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move . 
" See what I have become ? " the face said . 
" Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another's body ... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds .... Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks ... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own .... Now ... why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket ? " 
So he knew . 
" Better save your own life and join me ... or you ' ll meet the same end as your parents .... 
" LIAR ! " Harry shouted suddenly . 
The evil face was now smiling . 
" How touching ... " it hissed . 
I killed your father first ; and he put up a courageous fight ... but your mother needn't have died ... she was trying to protect you .... Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . " 
" NEVER ! " 
Harry sprang toward the flame door , but Voldemort screamed " SEIZE HIM ! " and the next second , Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist . 
At once , a needle - sharp pain seared across Harry's scar ; his head felt as though it was about to split in two ; he yelled , struggling with all his might , and to his surprise , Quirrell let go of him . 
The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone , and saw him hunched in pain , looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes . 
SEIZE HIM ! " shrieked Voldemort again , and Quirrell lunged , knocking Harry clean off his feet ' landing on top of him , both hands around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain , yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony . 
And Quirrell , though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees , let go of his neck and stared , bewildered , at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned , raw , red , and shiny . 
" Then kill him , fool , and be done ! " 
screeched Voldemort . 
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse , but Harry , by instinct , reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face - 
Quirrell rolled off him , his face blistering , too , and then Harry knew : Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin , not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell , keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse . 
Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of , " KILL HIM ! KILL HIM ! " and other voices , maybe in Harry's own head , crying , " Harry ! 
Harry ! " 
He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp , knew all was lost , and fell into blackness , down ... down ... down ... 
The Snitch ! 
He tried to catch it , but his arms were too heavy . 
He blinked . 
It was a pair of glasses . 
How strange . 
He blinked again . 
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him . 
" Good afternoon , Harry , " said Dumbledore . 
Harry stared at him . 
Then he remembered : " Sir ! 
The Stone ! 
It was Quirrell ! 
He's got the Stone ! 
Sir , quick -- " 
" Then who does ? 
Sir , I -- " 
" Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out . 
Harry swallowed and looked around him . 
He realized he must be in the hospital wing . 
He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets , and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop . 
" Tokens from your friends and admirers , " said Dumbledore , beaming . 
" What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows . 
Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . " 
" How long have I been in here ? " 
" Three days . 
" But sit , the Stone 
I see you are not to be distracted . 
Very well , the Stone . 
Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you . 
You got Hermione's owl ? " 
" We must have crossed in midair . 
No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left . 
I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you . " 
" It was you . " 
" I feared I might be too late . " 
" Not the Stone , boy , you -- the effort involved nearly killed you . 
" Destroyed ? " said Harry blankly . 
" But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel -- " 
" Oh , you know about Nicolas ? " said Dumbledore , sounding quite delighted . 
Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it's all for the best . " 
" But that means he and his wife will die , won't they ? " 
" They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . " 
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face . 
" To one as young as you , I'm sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day . 
After all , to the well - organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . 
You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing . 
As much money and life as you could want ! 
The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . " 
Harry lay there , lost for words . 
Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling . 
" Sir ? " said Harry . 
" I ' ve been thinking ... sir -- even if the Stone's gone , Vol - , I mean , You - Know - Who -- " 
" Call him Voldemort , Harry . 
Always use the proper name for things . 
Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . " 
" Yes , sir . 
" No , Harry , he has not . 
He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share ... not being truly alive , he cannot be killed . 
He left Quirrell to die ; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies . 
Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his return to power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . " 
Harry nodded , but stopped quickly , because it made his head hurt . 
Then he said , " Sir , there are some other things I'd like to know , if you can tell me ... things I want to know the truth about .... " 
Dumbledore sighed . 
" It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution . 
However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you ' ll forgive me . 
I shall not , of course , lie . " 
" Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me . 
But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? " 
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time . 
" Alas , the first thing you ask me , I cannot tell you . 
Not today . 
Not now . 
You will know , one day ... put it from your mind for now , Harry . 
When you are older ... 
I know you hate to hear this ... when you are ready , you will know . " 
" But why couldn't Quirrell touch me ? " 
" Your mother died to save you . 
If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand , it is love . 
Not a scar , no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever . 
It is in your very skin . 
Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason . 
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill , which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet . 
When he had found his voice again , Harry said , " And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me ? " 
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled . 
" Fire away . " 
" Quirrell said Snape -- " 
" Professor Snape , Harry . " 
" Yes , him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father . 
Is that true ? " 
" Well , they did rather detest each other . 
" What ? " 
" He saved his life . " 
" What ? " 
" Yes ... " said Dumbledore dreamily . 
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound , so he stopped . 
" And sir , there's one more thing ... " 
" Just the one ? " 
" How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? " 
" Ah , now , I'm glad you asked me that . 
You see , only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it , but not use it -- would be able to get it , otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life . 
I suggest you make a start on these sweets . 
I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one , and since then I'm afraid I ' ve rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I ' ll be safe with a nice toffee , don't you ? " 
He smiled and popped the golden - brown bean into his mouth . 
Then he choked and said , " Alas ! 
Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , was a nice woman , but very strict . 
" Just five minutes , " Harry pleaded . 
" Absolutely not . " 
" Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different . 
" I am resting , look , lying down and everything . 
" Oh , very well , " she said . 
" But five minutes only . " 
And she let Ron and Hermione in . 
" Harry ! " 
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again , but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore . 
" Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried -- " 
" The whole school's talking about it , " said Ron . " What really happened ? " 
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors . 
Harry told them everything : Quirrell ; the mirror ; the Stone ; and Voldemort . 
Ron and Hermione were a very good audience ; they gasped in all the right places , and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban , Hermione screamed out loud . 
" So the Stone's gone ? " said Ron finally . 
" That's what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it ? 
-- ' to the well - organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . 
" I always said he was off his rocker , " said Ron , looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was . 
" So what happened to you two ? " said Harry . 
" Well , I got back all right , " said Hermione . 
" I brought Ron round - that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said , ' Harry's gone after him , hasn't he ? ' and hurtled off to the third floor . " 
" D ' you think he meant you to do it ? " said Ron . " Sending you your father's cloak and everything ? " 
" No , it isn't , " said Harry thoughtfully . 
" He's a funny man , Dumbledore . 
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . 
I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . 
I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . 
It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could .... " 
" Yeah , Dumbledore's off his rocker , all right , " said Ron proudly . 
" Listen , you ' ve got to be up for the end - of - year feast tomorrow . 
The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food ' ll be good . " 
After a good night's sleep , Harry felt nearly back to normal . 
I want to go to the feast , " he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes . 
I can , can't I ? " 
" Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go , " she said stiffily , as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be . 
" And you have another visitor . " 
" Oh , good , " said Harry . 
" Who is it ? " 
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke . 
He sat down next to Harry , took one look at him , and burst into tears . 
" It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault ! " he sobbed , his face in his hands . 
I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy ! 
I told him ! 
It was the only thing he didn't know , an ' I told him ! 
" Hagrid ! " said Harry , shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse , great tears leaking down into his beard . 
" VOLDEMORT ! " Harry bellowed , and Hagrid was so shocked , he stopped crying . 
" I ' ve met him and I'm calling him by his name . 
Please cheer up , Hagrid , we saved the Stone , it's gone , he can't use it . 
Have a Chocolate Frog , I ' ve got loads .... " 
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said , " That reminds me . 
I ' ve got yeh a present . " 
" It's not a stoat sandwich , is it ? " said Harry anxiously , and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle . 
Harry opened it curiously . 
It was full of wizard photographs . 
Harry couldn't speak , but Hagrid understood . 
Harry made his way down to the end - of - year feast alone that night . 
It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row . 
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table . 
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush , and then everybody started talking loudly at once . 
He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him . 
Fortunately , Dumbledore arrived moments later . 
" Another year gone ! " Dumbledore said cheerfully . 
Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were ... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts .... 
" Now , as I understand it , the house cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points ; in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty - two ; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty - six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy - two . " 
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table . 
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table . 
It was a sickening sight . 
" Yes , Yes , well done , Slytherin , " said Dumbledore . " However , recent events must be taken into account . " 
The room went very still . 
Let me see . 
Yes ... 
Ron went purple in the face ; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn . 
" ... for the best - played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years , I award Gryffindor house fifty points . " 
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling ; the stars overhead seemed to quiver . 
My youngest brother ! 
" Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger ... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire , I award Gryffindor house fifty points . " 
Hermione buried her face in her arms ; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears . 
" Third -- to Mr . Harry Potter ... " said Dumbledore . 
The din was deafening . 
Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy - two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin . 
Dumbledore raised his hand . 
The room gradually fell silent . 
" There are all kinds of courage , " said Dumbledore , smiling . 
" It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies , but just as much to stand up to our friends . 
I therefore award ten points to Mr . Neville Longbottom . " 
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place , so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table . 
" Which means , Dumbledore called over the storm of applause , for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin , " we need a little change of decoration . " 
He clapped his hands . 
In an instant , the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold ; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place . 
Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand , with a horrible , forced smile . 
He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot . 
It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year , or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts . 
It was the best evening of Harry's life , better than winning at Quidditch , or Christmas , or knocking out mountain trolls ... he would never , ever forget tonight . 
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come , but come they did . 
To their great surprise , both he and Ron passed with good marks ; Hermione , of course , had the best grades of the first years . 
They had hoped that Goyle , who was almost as stupid as he was mean , might be thrown out , but he had passed , too . 
It was a shame , but as Ron said , you couldn't have everything in life . 
And suddenly , their wardrobes were empty , their trunks were packed , Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets ; notes were handed out to all students , warning them not to use magic over the holidays ( " I always hope they ' ll forget to give us these , " said Fred Weasley sadly ) ; Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake ; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express ; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier ; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns ; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats ; pulling into platform nine and three - quarters at King's Cross Station . 
A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier , letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles . 
" You must come and stay this summer , " said Ron , " both of you -- I ' ll send you an owl . " 
" Thanks , " said Harry , " I ' ll need something to look forward to . " 
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world . 
Some of them called : 
" Bye , Harry ! " 
" See you , Potter ! " 
" Still famous , " said Ron , grinning at him . 
" Not where I'm going , I promise you , " said Harry . 
He , Ron , and Hermione passed through the gateway together . 
It was Ginny Weasley , Ron's younger sister , but she wasn't pointing at Ron . 
" Harry Potter ! " she squealed . 
" Look , Mom ! 
I can see 
Mrs . Weasley smiled down at them . 
" Busy year ? " she said . 
" Very , " said Harry . 
" Thanks for the fudge and the sweater , Mrs . Weasley . " 
" Ready , are you ? " 
It was Uncle Vernon , still purple - faced , still mustached , still looking furious at the nerve of Harry , carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people . 
" You must be Harry's family ! " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" In a manner of speaking , " said Uncle Vernon . 
" Hurry up , boy , we haven't got all day . " 
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione . 
" See you over the summer , then . " 
" Oh , I will , " said Harry , and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face . 
" They don't know we ' re not allowed to use magic at home . 
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 
Not for the first time , an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four , Privet Drive . 
Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud , hooting noise from his nephew Harry's room . 
" Third time this week ! " he roared across the table . 
" If you can't control that owl , it ' ll have to go ! " Harry tried , yet again , to explain . 
" She's bored , " he said . 
" She's used to flying around outside . 
If I could just let her out at night — " " Do I look stupid ? " 
" I know what ' ll happen if that owl's let out . " 
He exchanged dark looks with his wife , Petunia . 
" I want more bacon . " 
" Dudley gets enough , don't you , son ? " Dudley , who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair , grinned and turned to Harry . 
" Pass the frying pan . " " You ' ve forgotten the magic word , " said Harry irritably . 
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible : Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen ; Mrs . Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth ; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet , veins throbbing in his temples . 
" I meant ' please ' ! " said Harry quickly . 
" I just — " " I WARNED YOU ! 
I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF ! " Harry stared from his purple - faced uncle to his pale aunt , who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet . 
" All right , " said Harry , " all right . . 
Uncle Vernon sat back down , breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small , sharp eyes . 
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays , Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment , because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy . 
As a matter of fact , he was as not normal as it is possible to be . 
Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays , it was nothing to how Harry felt . 
He missed the castle , with its secret passageways and ghosts , his classes ( though perhaps not Snape , the Potions master ) , the mail arriving by owl , eating banquets in the Great Hall , sleeping in his four - poster bed in the tower dormitory , visiting the gamekeeper , Hagrid , in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds , and , especially , Quidditch , the most popular sport in the wizarding world ( six tall goal posts , four flying balls , and fourteen players on broomsticks ) . 
All Harry's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron , and top - ofthe - line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home . 
What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer ? 
The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles ( not a drop of magical blood in their veins ) , 
and as far as they were concerned , having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame . 
Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl , Hedwig , inside her cage , to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world . 
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family . 
Uncle Vernon was large and neckless , with an enormous black mustache ; Aunt Petunia was horse - faced and bony ; Dudley was blond , pink , and porky . 
Harry , on the other hand , was small and skinny , with brilliant green eyes and jet - black hair that was always untidy . 
He wore round glasses , and on his forehead was a thin , lightning - shaped scar . 
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual , even for a wizard . 
This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past , of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys'doorstep eleven years before . 
At the age of one year old , Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time , Lord Voldemort , whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak . 
Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack , but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar , and somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry . 
He had spent ten years with the Dursleys , never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to , believing the Dursleys'story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents . 
And then , exactly a year ago , Hogwarts had written to Harry , and the whole story had come out . 
but now the school year was over , and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer , back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly . 
The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday . 
Of course , his hopes hadn't been high ; they'd never given him a real present , let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely . . . 
At that moment , Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said , " Now , as we all know , today is a very important day . " 
Harry looked up , hardly daring to believe it . 
Harry went back to his toast . 
Of course , he thought bitterly , Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party . 
Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him ( Uncle Vernon's company made drills ) . 
" I think we should run through the schedule one more time , " said Uncle Vernon . 
" We should all be in position at eight o ' clock . 
Petunia , you will be — ? " " In the lounge , " said Aunt Petunia promptly , " waiting to welcome them graciously to our home . " 
" Good , good . 
And Dudley ? " " I ' ll be waiting to open the door . " 
" Excellent , Dudley , " said Uncle Vernon . 
Then he rounded on Harry . 
" Exactly , " said Uncle Vernon nastily . 
" I will lead them into the lounge , introduce you , Petunia , and pour them drinks . 
" And , Dudley , you ' ll say — " " May I take you through to the dining room , Mrs . Mason ? " said Dudley , offering his fat arm to an invisible woman . 
sniffed Aunt Petunia . 
" And you ? " said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry . 
Petunia , any ideas ? " 
" Vernon tells me you ' re a wonderful golfer , Mr. Mason . . . . 
Do tell me where you bought your dress , Mrs . Mason . . . 
Dudley ? " " How about — ' We had to write an essay about our hero at school , Mr. Mason , and I wrote about you . ' " 
This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry . 
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son , while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing . 
" Too right , you will , " said Uncle Vernon forcefully . 
When dinner's over , you take Mrs . Mason back to the lounge for coffee , Petunia , and I ' ll bring the subject around to drills . 
We ' ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow . " 
He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive . 
And you , " he snarled at Harry . 
Harry left through the back door . 
It was a brilliant , sunny day . 
He crossed the lawn , slumped down on the garden bench , and sang under his breath : " Happy birthday to me . . . 
happy birthday to me . . 
He gazed miserably into the hedge . 
He had never felt so lonely . 
Neither of them had written to him all summer , even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay . 
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter , but it wasn't worth the risk . 
Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school . 
Harry hadn't told the 
For the first couple of weeks back , Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him . 
But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday . 
From any witch or wizard ? 
At the very end of last term , Harry had come face - to - face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself . 
Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self , but he was still terrifying , still cunning , still determined to regain power . 
Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes — Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench . 
He had been staring absent - mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back . 
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves . 
Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn . 
" I know what day it is , " sang Dudley , waddling toward him . 
" What ? " said Harry , not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been . 
" I know what day it is , " Dudley repeated , coming right up to him . 
" Well done , " said Harry . 
" So you ' ve finally learned the days of the week . " 
" Today's your birthday , " sneered Dudley . 
Haven't you even got friends at that freak place ? " " Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school , " said Harry coolly . 
Dudley hitched up his trousers , which were slipping down his fat bottom . 
" Why ' re you staring at the hedge ? " he said suspiciously . 
" I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire , " said Harry . 
Dudley stumbled backward at once , a look of panic on his fat face . 
" You c - can't — Dad told you you ' re not to do m - magic — he said he ' ll chuck you out of the house — and you haven't got anywhere else to go — you haven't got any friends to take you — " " Jiggery pokery ! " said Harry in a fierce voice . 
He's doing you know what ! " Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun . 
Then she gave him work to do , with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished . 
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream , Harry cleaned the windows , washed the car , mowed the lawn , trimmed the flowerbeds , pruned and watered the roses , and repainted the garden bench . 
Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds , his back aching , sweat running down his face . 
It was half past seven in the evening when at last , exhausted , he heard Aunt Petunia calling him . 
And walk on the newspaper ! " 
Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen . 
On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding : a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets . 
The Masons will be here soon ! " snapped Aunt Petunia , pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table . 
She was already wearing a salmon - pink cocktail dress . 
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper . 
" Upstairs ! 
Hurry ! " 
As he passed the door to the living room , Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets . 
He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs . 
" Remember , boy — one sound — " Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe , slipped inside , closed the door , and turned to collapse on his bed . 
The trouble was , there was already someone sitting on it . 
Harry managed not to shout out , but it was a close thing . 
The little creature on the bed had large , bat - like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls . 
Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning . 
As they stared at each other , Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall . 
" May I take your coats , Mr. and Mrs . Mason ? " 
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long , thin nose touched the carpet . 
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase , with rips for arm - and leg - holes . 
" Er — hello , " said Harry nervously . 
" Harry Potter ! " said the creature in a high - pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs . 
" So long has Dobby wanted to meet you , sir . . . 
Such an honor it is . . . 
" Th - thank you , " said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair , next to Hedwig , who was asleep in her large cage . 
He wanted to ask , " What are you ? " but thought it would sound too rude , so instead he said , " Who are you ? " 
" Dobby , sir . 
Just Dobby . 
Dobby the house - elf , " said the creature . 
" Oh — really ? " said Harry . 
The elf hung his head . 
" Not that I'm not pleased to meet you , " said Harry quickly , " but , er , is there any particular reason you ' re here ? " 
" Oh , yes , sir , " said Dobby earnestly . 
" Dobby has come to tell you , sir . . . it is difficult , sir . . . 
Dobby wonders where to begin . . . 
. " " Sit down , " said Harry politely , pointing at the bed . 
" Never . . . 
" I'm sorry , " he whispered , " I didn't mean to offend you or anything — " " Offend Dobby ! " choked the elf . 
At last he managed to control himself , and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration . 
Dobby shook his head . 
Then , without warning , he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window , shouting , " Bad Dobby ! 
Bad Dobby ! " " Don't — what are you doing ? " 
Harry hissed , springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage . 
" Dobby had to punish himself , sir , " said the elf , who had gone slightly cross - eyed . 
" Dobby almost spoke ill of his family , sir . . . 
. " " Your family ? " 
" The wizard family Dobby serves , sir . . . . 
Dobby is a houseelf — bound to serve one house and one family forever . . . 
. " " Do they know you ' re here ? " 
asked Harry curiously . 
Dobby shuddered . 
" Oh , no , sir , no . . . 
Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you , sir . 
Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this . 
If they ever knew , sir — " " But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door ? " " Dobby doubts it , sir . 
Dobby is always having to punish himself for something , sir . 
. " " But why don't you leave ? 
And the family will never set Dobby free . . . 
Dobby will serve the family until he dies , sir . . . 
Harry stared . 
" And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks , " 
he said . 
" This makes the Dursleys sound almost human . 
Can't anyone help you ? 
" Please , " Harry whispered frantically , " please be quiet . 
If the Dursleys hear anything , if they know you ' re here — " " Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . 
Dobby has heard of your greatness , sir , but of your goodness , Dobby never knew . . . 
Harry , who was feeling distinctly hot in the face , said , " Whatever you ' ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish . 
" Harry Potter is humble and modest , " said Dobby reverently , his orb - like eyes aglow . 
" Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — " " Voldemort ? " said Harry . 
" I know lots of people don't like it . 
My friend Ron — " He stopped again . 
Dobby leaned toward Harry , his eyes wide as headlights . 
" Dobby heard tell , " he said hoarsely , " that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time , just weeks ago . . . 
that Harry Potter escaped yet again . " 
Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears . 
" Ah , sir , " he gasped , dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing . 
" Harry Potter is valiant and bold ! 
He has braved so many dangers already ! 
But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter , to warn him , even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later . . . . 
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts . " 
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice . 
" W - what ? " 
Harry stammered . 
" But I ' ve got to go back — term starts on September first . 
It's all that's keeping me going . 
I don't belong here . 
I belong in your world — at Hogwarts . " 
" No , no , no , " squeaked Dobby , shaking his head so hard his ears flapped . 
" Harry Potter must stay where he is safe . 
He is too great , too good , to lose . 
If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts , he will be in mortal danger . " 
" Why ? " said Harry in surprise . 
" There is a plot , Harry Potter . 
" Dobby has known it for months , sir . 
Harry Potter must not put himself in peril . 
He is too important , sir ! " " What terrible things ? " said Harry at once . 
" Who's plotting them ? " 
" All right ! " cried Harry , grabbing the elf's arm to stop him . 
" You can't tell me . 
I understand . 
But why are you warning me ? " 
You could just shake or nod , " he added hastily as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again . 
Slowly , Dobby shook his head . 
" Not — not He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named , sir — " But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint . 
Harry , however , was completely lost . 
" He hasn't got a brother , has he ? " Dobby shook his head , his eyes wider than ever . 
" Well then , I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts , " said Harry . 
" I mean , there's Dumbledore , for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is , don't you ? " Dobby bowed his head . 
" Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had . 
Dobby knows it , sir . 
And before Harry could stop him , Dobby bounded off the bed , seized Harry's desk lamp , and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps . 
Two seconds later Harry , heart thudding madly , heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall , calling , " Dudley must have left his television on again , the little tyke ! " " Quick ! 
In the closet ! " hissed Harry , stuffing Dobby in , shutting the door , and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned . 
" What — the — devil — are — you — doing ? " said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth , his face horribly close to Harry's . 
One more sound and you ' ll wish you'd never been born , boy ! " 
He stomped flat - footed from the room . 
Shaking , Harry let Dobby out of the closet . 
" See why I ' ve got to go back to Hogwarts ? 
It's the only place I ' ve got — well , I think I ' ve got friends . " 
" Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter ? " said Dobby slyly . 
" How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me ? " Dobby shuffled his feet . 
" Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby . 
" Dobby has them here , sir , " said the elf . 
Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach , he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing . 
Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing , Ron's untidy scrawl , and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper , Hagrid . 
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry . 
" Harry Potter mustn't be angry . . . . 
Dobby hoped . . . 
if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . 
Harry Potter might not want to go back to school , sir . . . 
Harry wasn't listening . 
He made a grab for the letters , but Dobby jumped out of reach . 
" Harry Potter will have them , sir , if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts . 
Ah , sir , this is a danger you must not face ! 
Say you won't go back , sir ! " " No , " said Harry angrily . 
Before Harry could move , Dobby had darted to the bedroom door , pulled it open , and sprinted down the stairs . 
Mouth dry , stomach lurching , Harry sprang after him , trying not to make a sound . 
He jumped the last six steps , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby . 
From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying , " . . . 
tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers , Mr. Mason . 
Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear . 
Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding , the mountain of cream and sugared violets , was floating up near the ceiling . 
On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby . 
" No , " croaked Harry . 
" Please . . . 
. " " Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school — " " Dobby . . . 
please . . 
. " " Say it , sir — " " I can't — " Dobby gave him a tragic look . 
" Then Dobby must do it , sir , for Harry Potter's own good . " 
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart - stopping crash . 
Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered . 
With a crack like a whip , Dobby vanished . 
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry , rigid with shock , covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia's pudding . 
He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room , promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left , and handed him a mop . 
Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry , still shaking , started scrubbing the kitchen clean . 
Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after - dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window , dropped a letter on Mrs . Mason's head , and swooped out again . 
Mrs . Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics . 
Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes , and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke . 
Harry stood in the kitchen , clutching the mop for support , as Uncle Vernon advanced on him , a demonic glint in his tiny eyes . 
" Read it ! " he hissed evilly , brandishing the letter the owl had delivered . 
" Go on — read it ! " 
Harry took it . 
Dear Mr. Potter , We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine . 
As you know , underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school , and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school ( Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery , 1875 , Paragraph C ) . 
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non - magical community ( Muggles ) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy . 
Mafalda Hopkirk improper use of magic office Ministry of Magic 
Harry looked up from the letter and gulped . 
" Forgot to mention it . . . . 
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog , all his teeth bared . 
I'm locking you up . . . . 
You ' re never going back to that school . . . 
never . . . 
and if you try and magic yourself out — they ' ll expel you ! " 
And laughing like a maniac , he dragged Harry back upstairs . 
Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word . 
The following morning , he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window . 
He himself fitted a cat - flap in the bedroom door , so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day . 
They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening . 
Otherwise , he was locked in his room around the clock . 
Three days later , the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting , and Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation . 
He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him . 
Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats , he had lost his only weapon . 
Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts , but the way things were going , he'd probably starve to death anyway . 
The cat - flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared , pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room . 
Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray . 
She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust . 
He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat - flap and lay back down on the bed , somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup . 
Exhausted , stomach rumbling , mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions , Harry fell into an uneasy sleep . 
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo , with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage . 
He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out , asking for help , but Dobby called , " Harry Potter is safe there , sir ! " and vanished . 
Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage , laughing at him . 
" Stop it , " Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head . 
I'm trying to sleep . . . 
He opened his eyes . 
Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window . 
And someone was goggling through the bars at him : a freckle - faced , red - haired , long - nosed someone . 
Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window . 
" Ron ! " breathed Harry , creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars . 
" Ron , how did you — What the — ? " 
Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car , which was parked in midair . 
Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George , Ron's elder twin brothers . 
" All right , Harry ? " asked George . 
" What's been going on ? " said Ron . " Why haven't you been answering my letters ? 
" He works for the Ministry , " said Ron . " You know we ' re not supposed to do spells outside school — " 
" You should talk , " said Harry , staring at the floating car . 
It's Dad's , we didn't enchant it . 
But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — " " I told you , I didn't — but it ' ll take too long to explain now — look , can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back , and obviously I can't magic myself out , because the Ministry ' ll think that's the second spell I ' ve done in three days , so — " " Stop gibbering , " said Ron . " We ' ve come to take you home with us . " " But you can't magic me out either — " " We don't need to , " said Ron , jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning . 
" If the Dursleys wake up , I'm dead , " said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car . 
" Don't worry , " said Fred , " and stand back . " 
The car revved louder and louder and suddenly , with a crunching noise , the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air . 
Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground . 
Panting , Ron hoisted them up into the car . 
Harry listened anxiously , but there was no sound from the Dursleys ' bedroom . 
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron , Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry's window . 
" Get in , " Ron said . 
" But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick — " " Where is it ? " 
" Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I can't get out of this room — " " No problem , " said George from the front passenger seat . 
" Out of the way , Harry . " 
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry's room . 
You had to hand it to them , thought Harry , as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock . 
There was a small click and the door swung open . 
" Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks , " Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing . 
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron . 
Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs . 
Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough . 
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry's room to the open window . 
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron , and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side . 
Inch by inch , the trunk slid through the window . 
Uncle Vernon coughed again . 
" One good push — " Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car . 
" Okay , let's go , " George whispered . 
But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him , followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon's voice . 
Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on — he snatched up Hedwig's cage , dashed to the window , and passed it out to Ron . 
He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door — and it crashed open . 
For a split second , Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway ; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry , grabbing him by the ankle . 
Ron , Fred , and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard as they could . 
" Petunia ! " 
roared Uncle Vernon . 
" He's getting away ! 
But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon's grasp — Harry was in the car — he'd slammed the door shut — " Put your foot down , Fred ! " yelled Ron , and the car shot suddenly toward the moon . 
Harry couldn't believe it — he was free . 
He rolled down the window , the night air whipping his hair , and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were all hanging , dumbstruck , out of Harry's window . 
" See you next summer ! " 
Harry yelled . 
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear to ear . 
" Let Hedwig out , " he told Ron . " She can fly behind us . 
George handed the hairpin to Ron and , a moment later , Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost . 
" So — what's the story , Harry ? " said Ron impatiently . 
" What's been happening ? " 
Harry told them all about Dobby , the warning he'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding . 
" Very fishy , " said Fred finally . 
" I don't think he could , " said Harry . 
" I told you , every time he got close to letting something slip , he started banging his head against the wall . " 
He saw Fred and George look at each other . 
" What , you think he was lying to me ? " said Harry . 
I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com - 
ing back to Hogwarts . 
" Draco Malfoy , " Harry explained . 
" He hates me . " " Draco Malfoy ? " said George , turning around . 
" Not Lucius Malfoy's son ? " " Must be , it's not a very common name , is it ? " said Harry . 
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before , and they didn't surprise him at all . 
Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind , thoughtful , and sensitive boy . 
. " said Harry . 
" But all we ' ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden . 
Harry was silent . 
Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything , his family was rolling in wizard gold ; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house . 
Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do . 
" I'm glad we came to get you , anyway , " said Ron . " I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters . 
I thought it was Errol's fault at first — " " Who's Errol ? " " Our owl . 
He's ancient . 
" And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room . . . . 
Fred twiddled the steering wheel . 
" So , does your dad know you ' ve got the car ? " said Harry , guessing the answer . 
" Er , no , " said Ron , " he had to work tonight . 
Hopefully we ' ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it . " 
" What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic , anyway ? " " He works in the most boring department , " said Ron . " The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office . " 
Like , last year , some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop . 
It was a nightmare — Dad was working overtime for weeks . " 
" What happened ? " 
" The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose . 
He takes it apart , puts spells on it , and puts it back together again . 
If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest . 
It drives Mum mad . " " That's the main road , " said George , peering down through the windshield . 
A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east . 
Fred brought the car lower , and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees . 
" Ottery St . Catchpole . " 
Lower and lower went the flying car . 
The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees . 
" Touchdown ! " said Fred as , with a slight bump , they hit the ground . 
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard , and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house . 
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen , but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic ( which , Harry reminded himself , it probably was ) . 
Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof . 
A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read , the burrow . 
Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron . 
" It's not much , " said Ron . " It's wonderful , " said Harry happily , thinking of Privet Drive . 
They got out of the car . 
Then , Ron , you come bounding downstairs going , ' Mum , look who turned up in the night ! ' and she ' ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car . " 
" Right , " said Ron . " Come on , Harry , I sleep at the — at the top — " Ron had gone a nasty greenish color , his eyes fixed on the house . 
The other three wheeled around . 
Mrs . Weasley was marching across the yard , scattering chickens , and for a short , plump , kind - faced woman , it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber - toothed tiger . 
" Ah , " said Fred . 
" Oh , dear , " said George . 
Mrs . Weasley came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . 
She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket . 
" So , " she said . 
" ' Morning , Mum , " said George , in what he clearly thought was a jaunty , winning voice . 
" Have you any idea how worried I ' ve been ? " said Mrs . Weasley in a deadly whisper . 
" Sorry , Mum , but see , we had to — " All three of Mrs . Weasley's sons were taller than she was , but they cowered as her rage broke over them . 
" Beds empty ! 
No note ! 
" YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY ' S BOOK ! " yelled Mrs . Weasley , prodding a finger in Fred's chest . 
" I'm very pleased to see you , Harry , dear , " she said . 
" Come in and have some breakfast . " 
She turned and walked back into the house and Harry , after a nervous glance at Ron , who nodded encouragingly , followed her . 
The kitchen was small and rather cramped . 
There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle , and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat , looking around . 
He had never been in a wizard house before . 
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all . 
And unless Harry's ears were deceiving him , the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was " Witching Hour , with the popular singing sorceress , Celestina Warbeck . " 
" I don't blame you , dear , " she assured Harry , tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate . 
" Arthur and I have been worried about you , too . 
But really " ( she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate ) , " flying an illegal car halfway across the country — anyone could have seen you — " She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink , which began to clean themselves , clinking gently in the background . 
Mrs . Weasley snapped . 
" They were starving him , Mum ! " said George . 
" And you ! " said Mrs . Weasley , but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him . 
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small , redheaded figure in a long nightdress , who appeared in the kitchen , gave a small squeal , and ran out again . 
" Ginny , " said Ron in an undertone to Harry . 
She's been talking about you all summer . " 
" Yeah , she ' ll be wanting your autograph , Harry , " Fred said with a grin , but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word . 
Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean , which took a surprisingly short time . 
" Blimey , I'm tired , " yawned Fred , setting down his knife and fork at last . 
" I think I ' ll go to bed and — " " You will not , " snapped Mrs . Weasley . 
" It's your own fault you ' ve been up all night . 
" You can go up to bed , dear , " she added to Harry . 
I ' ve never seen a de - gnoming — " " That's very sweet of you , dear , but it's dull work , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Now , let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject — " And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece . 
George groaned . 
" Mum , we know how to de - gnome a garden — " 
Harry looked at the cover of Mrs . Weasley's book . 
There was a big photograph on the front of a very good - looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes . 
As always in the wizarding world , the photograph was moving ; the wizard , who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart , kept winking cheekily up at them all . 
Mrs . Weasley beamed down at him . 
" Don't be so ridiculous , Fred , " said Mrs . Weasley , her cheeks rather pink . 
" All right , if you think you know better than Lockhart , you can go and get on with it , and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it . " 
The garden was large , and in Harry's eyes , exactly what a garden should be . 
The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it — there were plenty of weeds , and the grass needed cutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the walls , plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed , and a big green pond full of frogs . 
" Gerroff me ! 
It was small and leathery looking , with a large , knobby , bald head exactly like a potato . 
Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet ; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down . 
" This is what you have to do , " he said . 
Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face , Ron added , " It doesn't hurt them — you ' ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes . " 
He let go of the gnome's ankles : It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge . 
" Pitiful , " said Fred . " I bet I can get mine beyond that stump . " 
He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge , but the gnome , sensing weakness , sank its razor - sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until — " Wow , Harry — that must ' ve been fifty feet . . . 
" The moment they know the de - gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look . 
Soon , the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line , their little shoulders hunched . 
" They ' ll be back , " said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field . 
" They love it here . . . . 
Just then , the front door slammed . 
" He's back ! " said George . 
They hurried through the garden and back into the house . 
Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed . 
He was a thin man , going bald , but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's . 
" Nine raids . 
Nine ! 
And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned . . . 
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed . 
" Find anything , Dad ? " said Fred eagerly . 
" All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle , " yawned Mr. Weasley . 
" Just Muggle - baiting , " sighed Mr. Weasley . 
" Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it . . . . 
Of course , it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking — they ' ll insist they just keep losing it . 
Mrs . Weasley had appeared , holding a long poker like a sword . 
Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open . 
He stared guiltily at his wife . 
" C - cars , Molly , dear ? " " Yes , Arthur , cars , " said Mrs . Weasley , her eyes flashing . 
" Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked , while really he was enchanting it to make it fly . " 
Mr. Weasley blinked . 
" Well , dear , I think you ' ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that , even if — er — he maybe would have done better to , um , tell his wife the truth . . . . 
There's a loophole in the law , you ' ll find . . . . 
As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car , the fact that the car could fly wouldn't — " " Arthur Weasley , you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law ! " shouted Mrs . Weasley . 
And for your information , Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly ! " " Harry ? " said Mr. Weasley blankly . 
" Harry who ? " 
He looked around , saw Harry , and jumped . 
" Good lord , is it Harry Potter ? Very pleased to meet you , Ron's told us so much about — " " Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night ! " 
shouted Mrs . Weasley . 
" What have you got to say about that , eh ? " " Did you really ? " said Mr. Weasley eagerly . 
. " " Let's leave them to it , " Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs . Weasley swelled like a bullfrog . 
" Come on , I ' ll show you my bedroom . " 
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase , which wound its way , zigzagging up through the house . 
On the third landing , a door stood ajar . 
Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap . 
She never shuts up normally — " They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it , saying ronald's room . 
Harry stepped in , his head almost touching the sloping ceiling , and blinked . 
It was like walking into a furnace : Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange : the bedspread , the walls , even the ceiling . 
Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards , all wearing bright orange robes , carrying broomsticks , and waving energetically . 
" Your Quidditch team ? " said Harry . 
" The Chudley Cannons , " said Ron , pointing at the orange bedspread , which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball . 
" Ninth in the league . " 
Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner , next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs , the Mad Muggle . 
Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill , next to his fat gray rat , Scabbers , who was snoozing in a patch of sun . 
Harry stepped over a pack of Self - Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window . 
In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys ' hedge . 
Then he turned to look at Ron , who was watching him almost nervously , as though waiting for his opinion . 
" It's a bit small , " said Ron quickly . 
And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic ; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning . . . 
But Harry , grinning widely , said , " This is the best house I ' ve ever been in . " 
Ron's ears went pink . 
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered ; the Weasleys ' house burst with the strange and unexpected . 
Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted , " Tuck your shirt in , scruffy ! " 
The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet , and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal . 
What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's , however , wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul : It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him . 
Mrs . Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal . 
Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles , asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked . 
" Ingenious , really , how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic . " 
Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow . 
He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs . Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table . 
She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun . 
" Letters from school , " said Mr. Weasley , passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment , addressed in green ink . 
You two ' ve got them , too , " he added , as Fred and George ambled in , still in their pajamas . 
Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first . 
There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year . 
Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart 
" You ' ve been told to get all Lockhart's books , too ! " he said . 
" That lot won't come cheap , " said George , with a quick look at his parents . 
. " " Well , we ' ll manage , " said Mrs . Weasley , but she looked worried . 
" Oh , are you starting at Hogwarts this year ? " 
Harry asked Ginny . 
She nodded , blushing to the roots of her flaming hair , and put her elbow in the butter dish . 
Fortunately no one saw this except Harry , because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in . 
" Morning , all , " said Percy briskly . 
He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately , pulling from underneath him a molting , gray feather duster — at least , that was what Harry thought it was , until he saw that it was breathing . 
" Errol ! " said Ron , taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing . 
" Finally — he's got Hermione's answer . 
I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys . " 
He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it , but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining board instead , muttering , " Pathetic . " 
Then he ripped open Hermione's letter and read it out loud : " ' Dear Ron , and Harry if you ' re there , " ' I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too . 
I ' ve been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl , because I think another delivery might finish your one off . 
— ' and we ' re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books . 
" ' Let me know what's happening as soon as you can . 
" What ' re you all up to today ? " Harry , Ron , Fred , and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned . 
It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below , meaning that they could practice Quidditch there , as long as they didn't fly too high . 
They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand , which was easily the best broom ; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies . 
Five minutes later they were marching up the hill , broomsticks over their shoulders . 
They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them , but he had said he was busy . 
Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far ; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time . 
" He's not himself . 
I don't think I could stand the shame . " 
Bill was the oldest Weasley brother . 
Harry had never met either of them , but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank , Gringotts . 
" Five sets of Lockhart books ! 
And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything . . . 
Harry said nothing . 
Of course , it was only in the wizarding world that he had money ; you couldn't use Galleons , Sickles , and Knuts in Muggle shops . 
He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys ; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold . 
Mrs . Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday . 
After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each , they pulled on their coats and Mrs . Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside . 
Ah well , guests first ! 
After you , Harry dear ! " 
Harry stared at them all watching him . 
" W - what am I supposed to do ? " he stammered . 
" He's never traveled by Floo powder , " said Ron suddenly . 
" Sorry , Harry , I forgot . " 
" Never ? " said Mr. Weasley . 
" But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year ? " 
" I went on the Underground — " " Really ? " said Mr. Weasley eagerly . 
How exactly — " " Not now , Arthur , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot , stepped up to the fire , and threw the powder into the flames . 
" Well , there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from , you know , but as long as you ' ve spoken clearly — " " He ' ll be fine , Molly , don't fuss , " said Mr. Weasley , helping himself to Floo powder , too . 
" Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney , don't worry about that — " " Well . . . 
all right . . . 
you go after Arthur , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Now , when you get into the fire , say where you ' re going — " " And keep your elbows tucked in , " Ron advised . 
" And your eyes shut , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" The soot — " " Don't fidget , " said Ron . " Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace — " " But don't panic and get out too early ; wait until you see Fred and George . " 
Trying hard to bear all this in mind , Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire . 
He took a deep breath , scattered the powder into the flames , and stepped forward ; the fire felt like a warm breeze ; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash . 
It felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain . 
He seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly , still spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop , and then — He fell , face forward , onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap . 
Dizzy and bruised , covered in soot , he got gingerly to his feet , holding his broken glasses up to his eyes . 
He was quite alone , but where he was , he had no idea . 
All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large , dimly lit wizard's shop — but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list . 
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion , a bloodstained pack of cards , and a staring glass eye . 
Evil - looking masks stared down from the walls , an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter , and rusty , spiked instruments hung from the ceiling . 
Even worse , the dark , narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley . 
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth , Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door , but before he'd got halfway toward it , two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost , covered in soot , and wearing broken glasses : Draco Malfoy . 
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left ; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed , leaving a small crack to peer through . 
Seconds later , a bell clanged , and Malfoy stepped into the shop . 
Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop , looking lazily at the items on display , and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying , " Touch nothing , Draco . " 
Malfoy , who had reached for the glass eye , said , " I thought you were going to buy me a present . " 
" Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year . 
He's not even that good , it's just because he's famous . . . 
everyone thinks he's so smart , wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick — " " You have told me this at least a dozen times already , " said Mr. Malfoy , with a quelling look at his son . 
" And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Potter , not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear — ah , Mr. Borgin . " 
A stooping man had appeared behind the counter , smoothing his greasy hair back from his face . 
" Mr. 
Malfoy , what a pleasure to see you again , " said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair . 
I must show you , just in today , and very reasonably priced — " " I'm not buying today , Mr. Borgin , but selling , " said Mr. Malfoy . 
The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face . 
" You have heard , of course , that the Ministry is conducting more raids , " said Mr. Malfoy , taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read . 
" I have a few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me , if the Ministry were to call . . . 
Mr. Malfoy's lip curled . 
" I have not been visited yet . 
" — and as you see , certain of these poisons might make it appear — " " I understand , sir , of course , " said Mr. Borgin . 
" Let me see . . 
. " " Can I have that ? " 
interrupted Draco , pointing at the withered hand on its cushion . 
" Ah , the Hand of Glory ! " said Mr. Borgin , abandoning Mr. Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco . 
" Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder ! 
Your son has fine taste , sir . " " I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer , Borgin , " said Mr. Malfoy coldly , and Mr. Borgin said quickly , " No offense , sir , no offense meant — " " Though if his grades don't pick up , " said Mr. Malfoy , more coldly still , " that may indeed be all he is fit for — " " It's not my fault , " retorted Draco . 
" The teachers all have favorites , that Hermione Granger — " " I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam , " snapped Mr. Malfoy . 
" It's the same all over , " said Mr. Borgin , in his oily voice . 
" In that case , perhaps we can return to my list , " said Mr. Malfoy shortly . 
Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read , smirking , the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals , Caution : Do Not Touch . 
Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him . 
He walked forward — he stretched out his hand for the handle — " Done , " said Mr. Malfoy at the counter . 
" Come , Draco — " Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away . 
" Good day to you , Mr. Borgin . 
I ' ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods . " 
Harry waited for a minute in case he came back , then , quietly as he could , slipped out of the cabinet , past the glass cases , and out of the shop door . 
Clutching his broken glasses to his face , Harry stared around . 
He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts . 
The one he'd just left , Borgin and Burkes , looked like the largest , but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and , two doors down , a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders . 
Feeling jumpy , Harry set off , trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here . 
This didn't help , as Harry had never heard of such a place . 
Trying to stay calm , he wondered what to do . 
An aged witch stood in front of him , holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails . 
Harry backed away . 
" I'm fine , thanks , " he said . 
" I'm just — " " HARRY ! 
Harry's heart leapt . 
" Hagrid ! " 
Harry croaked in relief . 
" I was lost — Floo powder — " Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch , knocking the tray right out of her hands . 
Harry saw a familiar , snow - white marble building in the distance — Gringotts Bank . 
" Yer a mess ! " said Hagrid gruffly , brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary . 
" I told you , I was lost — what were you doing down there , anyway ? " 
Yer not on yer own ? " " I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated , " Harry explained . 
" I ' ve got to go and find them . . . 
They set off together down the street . 
Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys . 
" Lousy Muggles , " growled Hagrid . 
Harry ! 
Over here ! " 
Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts . 
She ran down to meet them , her bushy brown hair flying behind her . 
" What happened to your glasses ? 
Hello , Hagrid — Oh , it's wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming into Gringotts , Harry ? " " As soon as I ' ve found the Weasleys , " said Harry . 
Harry and Hermione looked around : Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron , Fred , George , Percy , and Mr. Weasley . 
" Harry , " Mr. Weasley panted . 
" Knockturn Alley , " said Hagrid grimly . 
" Excellent ! " said Fred and George together . 
" We ' ve never been allowed in , " said Ron enviously . 
" I should ruddy well think not , " growled Hagrid . 
Mrs . Weasley now came galloping into view , her handbag swinging wildly in one hand , Ginny just clinging onto the other . 
" Oh , Harry — oh , my dear — you could have been anywhere — " Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away . 
Mr. Weasley took Harry's glasses , gave them a tap of his wand , and returned them , good as new . 
" See yer at Hogwarts ! " 
" Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes ? " 
Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps . 
" Malfoy and his father . " 
" Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything ? " said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them . 
" No , he was selling — " " So he's worried , " said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction . 
" Oh , I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something . . . 
. " " You be careful , Arthur , " said Mrs . Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door . 
" That family's trouble . 
" But you ' re Muggles ! " said Mr. Weasley delightedly . 
" We must have a drink ! 
Molly , look ! " 
" Meet you back here , " Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin . 
Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys ' vault , but felt dreadful , far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley , when it was opened . 
There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside , and just one gold Galleon . 
Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts , Lee Jordan . 
Mrs . Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop . 
Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione strolled off along the winding , cobbled street . 
" A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , " Ron read aloud off the back cover . 
. " " Go away , " Percy snapped . 
" ' Course , he's very ambitious , Percy , he's got it all planned out . . . . 
He wants to be Minister of Magic . . 
Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it . 
An hour later , they headed for Flourish and Blotts . 
They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop . 
As they approached it , they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors , trying to get in . 
The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows : 
" We can actually meet him ! " 
Hermione squealed . 
The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs . Weasley's age . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione squeezed inside . 
A long line wound right to the back of the shop , where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books . 
They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs . Granger . 
" Oh , there you are , good , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view , seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face , all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd . 
" This is for the Daily Prophet — " " Big deal , " said Ron , rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it . 
Gilderoy Lockhart heard him . 
He looked up . 
He saw Ron — and then he saw Harry . 
He stared . 
The crowd parted , whispering excitedly ; Lockhart dived forward , seized Harry's arm , and pulled him to the front . 
Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer , who was clicking away madly , wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys . 
" Nice big smile , Harry , " said Lockhart , through his own gleaming teeth . 
When he finally let go of Harry's hand , Harry could hardly feel his fingers . 
He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys , but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side . 
" Ladies and gentlemen , " he said loudly , waving for quiet . 
" What an extraordinary moment this is ! 
The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I ' ve been sitting on for some time ! 
" When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today , he only wanted to buy my autobiography — which I shall be happy to present him now , free of charge — " The crowd applauded again . 
" He had no idea , " Lockhart continued , giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose , " that he would shortly be getting much , much more than my book , Magical Me . 
He and his schoolmates will , in fact , be getting the real magical me . 
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September , I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ! " 
The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Staggering slightly under their weight , he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room , where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron . 
" You have these , " Harry mumbled to her , tipping the books into the cauldron . 
He straightened up and found himself face - to - face with Draco Malfoy , who was wearing his usual sneer . 
" Famous Harry Potter , " said Malfoy . 
It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry . 
She was glaring at Malfoy . 
" Potter , you ' ve got yourself a girlfriend ! " drawled Malfoy . 
Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over , both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books . 
" Oh , it's you , " said Ron , looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe . 
" Bet you ' re surprised to see Harry here , eh ? " " Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop , Weasley , " retorted Malfoy . 
" I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those . " 
Ron went as red as Ginny . 
He dropped his books into the cauldron , too , and started toward Malfoy , but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket . 
" Ron ! " said Mr. Weasley , struggling over with Fred and George . 
" What are you doing ? 
It's too crowded in here , let's go outside . " 
" Well , well , well — Arthur Weasley . " 
It was Mr. Malfoy . 
" Lucius , " said Mr. Weasley , nodding coldly . 
" Busy time at the Ministry , I hear , " said Mr. Malfoy . 
I hope they ' re paying you overtime ? " 
He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted , from amid the glossy Lockhart books , a very old , very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration . 
" Obviously not , " Mr. Malfoy said . 
" Dear me , what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it ? " 
Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny . 
" Clearly , " said Mr. Malfoy , his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs . Granger , who were watching apprehensively . 
and I thought your family could sink no lower — " There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying ; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy , knocking him backward into a bookshelf . 
In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart . 
Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools . 
He was still holding Ginny's old Transfiguration book . 
He thrust it at her , his eyes glittering with malice . 
" Here , girl — take your book — it's the best your father can give you — " Pulling himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop . 
" Yeh should ' ve ignored him , Arthur , " said Hagrid , almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes . 
" Rotten ter the core , the whole family , everyone knows that — no Malfoy's worth listenin'ter — bad blood , that's what it is — come on now — let's get outta here . " 
The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving , but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it . 
They hurried up the street , the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs . Weasley beside herself with fury . 
He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report — said it was all publicity — " But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron , where Harry , the Weasleys , and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder . 
They said good - bye to the Grangers , who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side ; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked , but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs . Weasley's face . 
Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder . 
It definitely wasn't his favorite way to travel . 
He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts , but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life . 
It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive . 
On their last evening , Mrs . Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things , ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding . 
Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks ; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour . 
Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed . 
It took a long while to get started next morning . 
Mrs . Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills ; people kept colliding on the stairs , half - dressed with bits of toast in their hands ; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck , tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car . 
Harry couldn't see how eight people , six large trunks , two owls , and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia . 
He had reckoned , of course , without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added . 
" Not a word to Molly , " he whispered to Harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily . 
When at last they were all in the car , Mrs . Weasley glanced into the back seat , where Harry , Ron , Fred , George , and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side , and said , " Muggles do know more than we give them credit for , don't they ? " 
Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard , Harry turning back for a last look at the house . 
By the time she had clambered back into the car , they were running very late , and tempers were running high . 
Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife . 
Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station . 
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year . 
" Percy first , " said Mrs . Weasley , looking nervously at the clock overhead , which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier . 
Percy strode briskly forward and vanished . 
Mr. Weasley went next ; Fred and George followed . 
" I ' ll take Ginny and you two come right after us , " Mrs . Weasley told Harry and Ron , grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off . 
In the blink of an eye they were gone . 
" Let's go together , we ' ve only got a minute , " Ron said to Harry . 
Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier . 
He felt perfectly confident ; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder . 
Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier , gathering speed . 
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump , Harry was knocked off his feet , and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor , and she rolled away , shrieking indignantly ; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled , " What in blazes d ' you think you ' re doing ? " " Lost control of the trolley , " Harry gasped , clutching his ribs as he got up . 
Ron ran to pick up Hedwig , who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd . 
" Why can't we get through ? " 
Harry hissed to Ron . " I dunno — " Ron looked wildly around . 
" We're going to miss the train , " Ron whispered . 
" I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself — " Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach . 
Ten seconds . . . 
nine seconds . . . 
He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might . 
Three seconds . . . 
two seconds . . . 
" It's gone , " said Ron , sounding stunned . 
" The train's left . 
Harry gave a hollow laugh . 
" The Dursleys haven't given me pocket money for about six years . " 
Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier . 
" What ' re we going to do ? 
I don't know how long it ' ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us . " 
They looked around . 
" The car ! " " What about it ? " 
" We can fly the car to Hogwarts ! " " But I thought — " " We're stuck , right ? 
And we ' ve got to get to school , haven't we ? 
And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's a real emergency , section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy — " " But your mum and dad . . 
. " said Harry , pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way . 
" They don't need the car ! " said Ron impatiently . 
You know , just vanish and reappear at home ! 
" Can you fly it ? " 
" C ' mon , let's go . 
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles , out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked . 
They heaved their luggage back in , put Hedwig on the back seat , and got into the front . 
Harry stuck his head out of the window : Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead , but their street was empty . 
" Okay , " he said . 
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard . 
Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him , hear the engine , feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose , but for all he could see , he had become a pair of eyeballs , floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars . 
" Let's go , " said Ron's voice from his right . 
And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away , dropping out of sight as the car rose ; in seconds , the whole of London lay , smoky and glittering , below them . 
Then there was a popping noise and the car , Harry , and Ron reappeared . 
" Uh - oh , " said Ron , jabbing at the Invisibility Booster . 
" It's faulty — " Both of them pummeled it . 
The car vanished . 
Then it flickered back again . 
" Hold on ! " 
ator ; they shot straight into the low , woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy . 
" We need to see the train to know what direction to go in , " said Ron . " Dip back down again — quickly — " They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats , squinting at the ground . 
" I can see it ! " 
Harry yelled . 
" Right ahead — there ! " 
" Due north , " said Ron , checking the compass on the dashboard . 
" Okay , we ' ll just have to check on it every half hour or so — hold on — " And they shot up through the clouds . 
A minute later , they burst out into a blaze of sunlight . 
It was a different world . 
The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud , the sky a bright , endless blue under the blinding white sun . 
They looked at each other and started to laugh ; for a long time , they couldn't stop . 
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream . 
This , thought Harry , was surely the only way to travel — past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud , in a car full of hot , bright sunlight , with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment , and the prospect of seeing Fred's and George's jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle . 
They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north , each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view . 
The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink . 
He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters , but Harry's T - shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose . 
It was still right below them , winding its way past a snowcapped mountain . 
Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again , but as he did so , the engine began to whine . 
Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances . 
" It's probably just tired , " said Ron . " It's never been this far before . . . 
And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker . 
Stars were blossoming in the blackness . 
Harry pulled his sweater back on , trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly , as though in protest . 
" Not far , " said Ron , more to the car than to Harry , " not far now , " and he patted the dashboard nervously . 
When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later , they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew . 
" There ! " 
Harry shouted , making Ron and Hedwig jump . 
Silhouetted on the dark horizon , high on the cliff over the lake , stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle . 
" Come on , " Ron said cajolingly , giving the steering wheel a little shake , " nearly there , come on — " The engine groaned . 
Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood . 
Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake . 
The car gave a nasty wobble . 
Glancing out of his window , Harry saw the smooth , black , glassy surface of the water , a mile below . 
Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel . 
The car wobbled again . 
" Come on , " Ron muttered . 
They were over the lake — the castle was right ahead — Ron put his foot down . 
There was a loud clunk , a splutter , and the engine died completely . 
" Uh - oh , " said Ron , into the silence . 
The nose of the car dropped . 
Ron yelled , swinging the steering wheel around ; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc , soaring over the dark greenhouses , then the vegetable patch , and then out over the black lawns , losing altitude all the time . 
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket — " STOP ! 
STOP ! " he yelled , whacking the dashboard and the windshield , but they were still plummeting , the ground flying up toward them — " WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE ! " Harry bellowed , lunging for the steering wheel , but too late — CRUNCH . 
With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood , they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt . 
Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood ; Hedwig was shrieking in terror ; a golf - ball - sized lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he had hit the windshield ; and to his right , Ron let out a low , despairing groan . 
" Are you okay ? " 
Harry said urgently . 
" My wand , " said Ron , in a shaky voice . 
Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it up at the school , but he never even got started . 
At that very moment , something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull , sending him lurching sideways into Ron , just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof . 
" What's happen — ? " 
Ron gasped , staring through the windshield , and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it . 
Its trunk was bent almost double , and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach . 
" Aaargh ! " said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door ; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle - like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof , which seemed to be caving — " Run for it ! " 
" We're done for ! " he moaned as the ceiling sagged , but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating — the engine had restarted . 
Harry yelled , and the car shot backward ; the tree was still trying to hit them ; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up , lashing out at them as they sped out of reach . 
" That , " panted Ron , " was close . 
Well done , car — " The car , however , had reached the end of its tether . 
With two sharp clunks , the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways : Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground . 
Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk ; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open ; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look . 
Then , dented , scratched , and steaming , the car rumbled off into the darkness , its rear lights blazing angrily . 
But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust . 
" Can you believe our luck ? " said Ron miserably , bending down to pick up Scabbers . 
" Of all the trees we could ' ve hit , we had to get one that hits back . " 
He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree , which was still flailing its branches threateningly . 
" Come on , " said Harry wearily , " we'd better get up to the school . . . 
Stiff , cold , and bruised , they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope , toward the great oak front doors . 
" I think the feast's already started , " said Ron , dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window . 
" Hey — Harry — come and look — it's the Sorting ! " 
Harry hurried over and , together , he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall . 
Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long , crowded tables , making the golden plates and goblets sparkle . 
Overhead , the bewitched ceiling , which always mirrored the sky outside , sparkled with stars . 
Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats , Harry saw a long line of scared - looking first years filing into the Hall . 
Ginny was among them , easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair . 
Meanwhile , Professor McGonagall , a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun , was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers . 
Every year , this aged old hat , patched , frayed , and dirty , sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses ( Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin ) . 
For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin , the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor , along with Ron , Hermione , and the rest of the Weasleys . 
Last term , Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship , beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years . 
A very small , mousy - haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head . 
Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore , the headmaster , sat watching the Sorting from the staff table , his long silver beard and half - moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight . 
Several seats along , Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart , dressed in robes of aquamarine . 
And there at the end was Hagrid , huge and hairy , drinking deeply from his goblet . 
" Hang on . . 
Where's Snape ? " Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher . 
" Maybe he's ill ! " said Ron hopefully . 
" Maybe he's left , " said Harry , " because he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again ! " " Or he might have been sacked ! " said Ron enthusiastically . 
Harry spun around . 
There , his black robes rippling in a cold breeze , stood Severus Snape . 
He was a thin man with sallow skin , a hooked nose , and greasy , shoulder - length black hair , and at this moment , he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble . 
" Follow me , " said Snape . 
Not daring even to look at each other , Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast , echoing entrance hall , which was lit with flaming torches . 
A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall , but Snape led them away from the warmth and light , down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons . 
They entered Snape's office , shivering . 
The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars , in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the moment . 
The fireplace was dark and empty . 
Snape closed the door and turned to look at them . 
" So , " he said softly , " the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick , Weasley . 
Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we , boys ? " " No , sir , it was the barrier at King's Cross , it — " 
" Silence ! " said Snape coldly . 
" What have you done with the car ? " Ron gulped . 
This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds . 
He began to read aloud : " Two Muggles in London , convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower . . . 
Mr. Angus Fleet , of Peebles , reported to police . . . 
" Dear , dear . . . 
his own son . . 
Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches . 
If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car . . . he hadn't thought of that . . . . 
" I noticed , in my search of the park , that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow , " Snape went on . 
" That tree did more damage to us than we — " Ron blurted out . 
" Most unfortunately , you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me . 
You will wait here . " 
Harry and Ron stared at each other , white - faced . 
He now felt extremely sick . 
He tried not to look at a large , slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape's desk . 
She might be fairer than Snape , but she was still extremely strict . 
Ten minutes later , Snape returned , and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him . 
Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions , but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go , or he had never seen her this angry before . 
She raised her wand the moment she entered ; Harry and Ron both flinched , but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace , where flames suddenly erupted . 
Ron launched into the story , starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through . 
" — so we had no choice , Professor , we couldn't get on the train . " 
I believe you have an owl ? " Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry . 
Harry gaped at her . 
Now she'd said it , that seemed the obvious thing to have done . 
" I — I didn't think — " " That , " said Professor McGonagall , " is obvious . " 
There was a knock on the office door and Snape , now looking happier than ever , opened it . 
Harry's whole body went numb . 
Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow . 
Then Dumbledore said , " Please explain why you did this . " 
Harry hated the disappointment in his voice . 
For some reason , he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes , and spoke instead to his knees . 
He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car , making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station . 
He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once , but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car . 
When Harry had finished , he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles . 
" We ' ll go and get our stuff , " said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice . 
" What are you talking about , Weasley ? " barked Professor McGonagall . 
Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore . 
" Not today , Mr. Weasley , " said Dumbledore . " But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done . 
I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again , I will have no choice but to expel you . " 
" They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility . " 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
" I must go back to the feast , Minerva , I ' ve got to give out a few notices . 
" Not much , " said Ron , hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve . 
" Professor , I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted — " " The Sorting Ceremony is over , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" But you will both get a detention . " 
It was better than Harry had expected . 
As for Dumbledore's writing to the Dursleys , that was nothing . 
Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk . 
A large plate of sandwiches , two silver goblets , and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop . 
" You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory , " she said . 
" I must also return to the feast . " 
" So did I , " said Harry , taking one , too . 
" Fred and George must ' ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them . " 
" Why couldn't we get through the barrier ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could ( the plate kept refilling itself ) , they rose and left the office , treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower . 
The castle was quiet ; it seemed that the feast was over . 
They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor , and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs , until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden , behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress . 
" Password ? " 
" Er — " said Harry . 
" There you are ! 
Where have you been ? 
" Skip the lecture , " said Ron impatiently , " and tell us the new password . " 
" It's ' wattlebird , ' " said Hermione impatiently , " but that's not the point — " Her words were cut short , however , as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping . 
It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake , packed into the circular common room , standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs , waiting for them to arrive . 
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside , leaving Hermione to scramble in after them . 
" Brilliant ! " yelled Lee Jordan . 
What an entrance ! 
Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow , people ' ll be talking about that one for years — " " Good for you , " said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to ; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon ; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together , " Why couldn't we ' ve come in the car , eh ? " 
Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years , and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off . 
Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction . 
Ron got the point at once . 
" Got to get upstairs — bit tired , " he said , and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room , which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories . 
" ' Night , " Harry called back to Hermione , who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's . 
They managed to get to the other side of the common room , still having their backs slapped , and gained the peace of the staircase . 
They hurried up it , right to the top , and at last reached the door of their old dormitory , which now had a sign on it saying second years . 
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry . 
" I know I shouldn't ' ve enjoyed that or anything , but — " The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys , Seamus Finnigan , Dean Thomas , and Neville Longbottom . 
" Unbelievable ! " beamed Seamus . 
" Cool , " said Dean . " Amazing , " said Neville , awestruck . 
He grinned , too . 
CHAPTER SIX : GILDEROY LOCKHART 
The next day , however , Harry barely grinned once . 
Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall . 
The four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge , plates of kippers , mountains of toast , and dishes of eggs and bacon , beneath the enchanted ceiling ( today , a dull , cloudy gray ) . 
Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione , who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug . 
There was a slight stiffness in the way she said " ' Morning , " which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived . 
Neville Longbottom , on the other hand , greeted them cheerfully . 
Neville was a round - faced and accident - prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met . 
" Mail's due any minute — I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot . " 
Harry had only just started his porridge when , sure enough , there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in , circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd . 
A big , lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and , a second later , something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug , spraying them all with milk and feathers . 
" Errol ! " said Ron , pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet . 
Errol slumped , unconscious , onto the table , his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak . 
" Oh , no — " Ron gasped . 
" It's all right , he's still alive , " said Hermione , prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger . 
" It's not that — it's that . " 
Ron was pointing at the red envelope . 
It looked quite ordinary to Harry , but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode . 
" What's the matter ? " said Harry . 
" She's — she's sent me a Howler , " said Ron faintly . 
" You'd better open it , Ron , " said Neville in a timid whisper . 
Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope . 
" What's a Howler ? " he said . 
But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter , which had begun to smoke at the corners . 
Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears . 
He thought for a moment it had exploded ; a roar of sound filled the huge hall , shaking dust from the ceiling . 
People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler , and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen . 
A ringing silence fell . 
The red envelope , which had dropped from Ron's hand , burst into flames and curled into ashes . 
Harry and Ron sat stunned , as though a tidal wave had just passed over them . 
Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head . 
" Well , I don't know what you expected , Ron , but you — " " Don't tell me I deserved it , " snapped Ron . 
Harry pushed his porridge away . 
Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work . 
After all Mr. and Mrs . Weasley had done for him over the summer . . . 
Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione left the castle together , crossed the vegetable patch , and made for the greenhouses , where the magical plants were kept . 
As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside , waiting for Professor Sprout . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn , accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages , and with another twinge of guilt , Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance , several of its branches now in slings . 
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair ; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint . 
But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is ! 
There was a murmur of interest . 
They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants . 
Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door . 
Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant , umbrella - sized flowers dangling from the ceiling . 
He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out . 
" Harry ! 
" Harry , " said Lockhart , his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head . 
" Harry , Harry , Harry . " 
Completely nonplussed , Harry said nothing . 
" When I heard — well , of course , it was all my fault . 
Harry had no idea what he was talking about . 
Flying a car to Hogwarts ! 
Well , of course , I knew at once why you'd done it . 
Stood out a mile . 
Harry , Harry , Harry . " 
" Gave you the bug . 
" Oh , no , Professor , see — " " Harry , Harry , Harry , " said Lockhart , reaching out and grasping his shoulder . 
" I understand . 
Natural to want a bit more once you ' ve had that first taste — and I blame myself for giving you that , because it was bound to go to your head — but see here , young man , you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed . 
Just calm down , all right ? 
Yes , yes , I know what you ' re thinking ! 
But when I was twelve , I was just as much of a nobody as you are now . 
I mean , a few people have heard of you , haven't they ? 
He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead . 
" I know , I know — it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's MostCharming - Smile Award five times in a row , as I have — but it's a start , Harry , it's a start . " 
He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off . 
Harry stood stunned for a few seconds , then , remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse , he opened the door and slid inside . 
Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse . 
When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione , she said , " We ' ll be repotting Mandrakes today . 
Now , who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake ? " 
To nobody's surprise , Hermione's hand was first into the air . 
" It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state . " 
" Excellent . 
Ten points to Gryffindor , " said Professor Sprout . 
" The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes . 
It is also , however , dangerous . 
Who can tell me why ? " Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again . 
Take another ten points , " said Professor Sprout . 
" Now , the Mandrakes we have here are still very young . " 
They looked quite unremarkable to Harry , who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the " cry " of the Mandrake . 
" Everyone take a pair of earmuffs , " said Professor Sprout . 
" When it is safe to remove them , I will give you the thumbs - up . 
Right — earmuffs on . " 
Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears . 
Professor Sprout put the pink , fluffy pair over her own ears , rolled up the sleeves of her robes , grasped one of the tufty plants firmly , and pulled hard . 
Instead of roots , a small , muddy , and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth . 
He had pale green , mottled skin , and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs . 
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it , burying him in dark , damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible . 
" Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula , it's teething . " 
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky , dark red plant as she spoke , making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly - haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to . 
" Know who you are , of course , the famous Harry Potter . . . . 
And you ' re Hermione Granger — always top in everything " 
The Howler was obviously still on his mind . 
Have you read his books ? 
I'd have died of fear if I'd been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf , but he stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic . 
I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead . 
Of course , Mother was slightly disappointed , but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it ' ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . 
After that they didn't have much chance to talk . 
Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes . 
Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy , but it wasn't . 
By the end of the class , Harry , like everyone else , was sweaty , aching , and covered in earth . 
Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration . 
Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work , but today was especially difficult . 
Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer . 
He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button , but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand . 
It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments , and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs . 
Unable to see what he was doing , Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one . 
Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased . 
Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell . 
Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron , who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk . 
" Defense Against the Dark Arts , " said Hermione at once . 
Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again . 
Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched . 
He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera , and the moment Harry looked at him , he went bright red . 
" All right , Harry ? 
I'm — I'm Colin Creevey , " he said breathlessly , taking a tentative step forward . 
" I'm in Gryffindor , too . 
" A picture ? " 
Harry repeated blankly . 
" I know all about you . 
Everyone's told me . 
About how you survived when You - Know - Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you ' ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead " ( his eyes raked Harry's hairline ) " and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion , the pictures ' ll move . " 
I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts . 
So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him . 
And then , could you sign it ? " 
" Everyone line up ! " Malfoy roared to the crowd . 
" Harry Potter's giving out signed photos ! " " No , I'm not , " said Harry angrily , his fists clenching . 
" Shut up , Malfoy . " 
" You ' re just jealous , " piped up Colin , whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck . 
" Of what ? 
Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly . 
" Eat slugs , Malfoy , " said Ron angrily . 
" Be careful , Weasley , " sneered Malfoy . 
" You don't want to start any trouble or your mommy ' ll have to come and take you away from school . " 
He put on a shrill , piercing voice . 
" Who's giving out signed photos ? " 
We meet again , Harry ! " Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation , Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd . 
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them , signaling the start of afternoon classes . 
" Off you go , move along there , " Lockhart called to the crowd , and he set off back to the castle with Harry , who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell , still clasped to his side . 
" A word to the wise , Harry , " said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door . 
Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class , where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him , so that he could avoid looking at the real thing . 
The rest of the class came clattering in , and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry . 
" Shut up , " snapped Harry . 
The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase " Harry Potter fan club . " 
When the whole class was seated , Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell . 
" Gilderoy Lockhart , Order of Merlin , Third Class , Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League , and five - time winner of Witch Weekly's Most - Charming - Smile Award — but I don't talk about that . 
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her ! " He waited for them to laugh ; a few people smiled weakly . 
" I see you ' ve all bought a complete set of my books — well done . 
I thought we'd start today with a little quiz . 
Nothing to worry about — just to check how well you ' ve read them , how much you ' ve taken in — " When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said , " You have thirty minutes — start — now ! " Harry looked down at his paper and read : 
1 . What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color ? 2 . What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition ? 
3 . What , in your opinion , is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date ? 
54 . 
When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday , and what would his ideal gift be ? 
Half an hour later , Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class . 
I say so in Year with the Yeti . 
And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non - magic peoples — though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky ! " 
Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face ; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas , who were sitting in front , were shaking with silent laughter . 
Hermione , on the other hand , was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name . 
but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair - care potions — good girl ! 
Where is Miss Hermione Granger ? " 
" Excellent ! " beamed Lockhart . 
Take ten points for Gryffindor ! 
It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind ! 
All I ask is that you remain calm . " 
Lockhart placed a hand on the cover . 
Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now . 
Neville was cowering in his front row seat . 
" I must ask you not to scream , " said Lockhart in a low voice . 
As the whole class held its breath , Lockhart whipped off the cover . 
" Yes , " he said dramatically . 
He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror . 
" Yes ? " 
He smiled at Seamus . 
" Well , they ' re not — they ' re not very — dangerous , are they ? " 
Seamus choked . 
The moment the cover had been removed , they had started jabbering and rocketing around , rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them . 
" Right , then , " Lockhart said loudly . 
And he opened the cage . 
It was pandemonium . 
Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air . 
Several shot straight through the window , showering the back row with broken glass . 
The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino . 
They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them , shredded books and papers , tore pictures from the walls , up - ended the waste basket , grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window ; within minutes , half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling . 
He rolled up his sleeves , brandished his wand , and bellowed , " Peskipiksi Pesternomi ! " 
It had absolutely no effect ; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window , too . 
In the relative calm that followed , Lockhart straightened up , caught sight of Harry , Ron , and Hermione , who were almost at the door , and said , " Well , I ' ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage . " 
" Can you believe him ? " 
roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear . 
" Hands on ? " said Harry , who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out . 
" You ' ve read his books — look at all those amazing things he's done — " " He says he's done , " Ron muttered . 
Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor . 
Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey , who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule . 
Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say , " All right , Harry ? " six or seven times a day and hear , " Hello , Colin , " back , however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it . 
Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning , surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes , creating a large , throbbing green boil where it had struck . 
He , Ron , and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning . 
" Whassamatter ? " said Harry groggily . 
" Quidditch practice ! " said Wood . " Come on ! " 
Harry squinted at the window . 
There was a thin mist hanging across the pink - and - gold sky . 
Now that he was awake , he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making . 
" Oliver , " Harry croaked . 
" It's the crack of dawn . " 
" Exactly , " said Wood . 
He was a tall and burly sixth year and , at the moment , his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm . 
" It's part of our new training program . 
" None of the other teams have started training yet ; we ' re going to be first off the mark this year — " Yawning and shivering slightly , Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes . 
" Good man , " said Wood . " Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes . " 
When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth , Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room , his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder . 
He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase , his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand . 
" I heard someone saying your name on the stairs , Harry ! 
Look what I ' ve got here ! 
I ' ve had it developed , I wanted to show you — " 
Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose . 
A moving , black - and - white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own . 
He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view . 
As Harry watched , Lockhart gave up and slumped , panting , against the white edge of the picture . 
" No , " said Harry flatly , glancing around to check that the room was really deserted . 
" Oh , wow ! Wait for me ! 
I ' ve never watched a Quidditch game before ! " 
Colin scrambled through the hole after him . 
" It ' ll be really boring , " Harry said quickly , but Colin ignored him , his face shining with excitement . 
" You were the youngest House player in a hundred years , weren't you , Harry ? 
" You must be brilliant . 
I ' ve never flown . 
Is it easy ? 
Is that your own broom ? 
Is that the best one there is ? " Harry didn't know how to get rid of him . 
" I don't really understand Quidditch , " said Colin breathlessly . 
" Is it true there are four balls ? 
" Yes , " said Harry heavily , resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch . 
Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters . " 
" And what are the other balls for ? " 
Colin asked , tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open - mouthed at Harry . 
" Well , the Quaffle — that's the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals . 
Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch — they ' re three long poles with hoops on the end . " 
" And the fourth ball — " " — is the Golden Snitch , " said Harry , " and it's very small , very fast , and difficult to catch . 
And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points . " 
" And you ' re the Gryffindor Seeker , aren't you ? " said Colin in awe . 
" Yes , " said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew - drenched grass . 
That's it , really . " 
But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field , and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms ; Colin called after him in a piping voice , " I ' ll go and get a good seat , Harry ! " and hurried off to the stands . 
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room . 
Fred and George Weasley were sitting , puffy - eyed and touslehaired , next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet , who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her . 
" There you are , Harry , what kept you ? " said Wood briskly . 
" Now , I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field , because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program , which I really think will make all the difference . . . 
Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field , on which were drawn many lines , arrows , and crosses in differentcolored inks . 
He took out his wand , tapped the board , and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars . 
As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics , Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore . 
Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on . 
" Is that clear ? 
Any questions ? " " I ' ve got a question , Oliver , " said George , who had woken with a start . 
" Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake ? " 
" We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year . 
We're easily the best team . 
But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our control — " 
Harry shifted guiltily in his seat . 
He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year , meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years . 
Wood took a moment to regain control of himself . 
Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him . 
" So this year , we train harder than ever before . . . . 
Okay , let's go and put our new theories into practice ! " 
Wood shouted , seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms . 
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now , although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium . 
As Harry walked onto the field , he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands . 
" Haven't even started , " said Harry , looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall . 
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground , soaring up into the air . 
He soared right around the stadium at full speed , racing Fred and George . 
Harry looked into the stands . 
Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats , his camera raised , taking picture after picture , the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium . 
" Look this way , Harry ! 
" What's going on ? " said Wood , frowning , as he skimmed through the air toward them . 
I don't like it . 
He could be a Slytherin spy , trying to find out about our new training program . " 
" He's in Gryffindor , " said Harry quickly . 
" What makes you say that ? " said Wood testily . 
" Because they ' re here in person , " said George , pointing . 
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field , broomsticks in their hands . 
" I don't believe it ! " 
Wood hissed in outrage . 
" I booked the field for today ! 
We ' ll see about this ! " Wood shot toward the ground , landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger , staggering slightly as he dismounted . 
Harry , Fred , and George followed . 
" Flint ! " 
Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain . 
" This is our practice time ! 
He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied , " Plenty of room for all of us , Wood . " 
Angelina , Alicia , and Katie had come over , too . 
" I booked it ! " 
" Ah , " said Flint . 
' I , Professor S . Snape , give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker . ' " 
" You ' ve got a new Seeker ? " said Wood , distracted . 
" Where ? " 
It was Draco Malfoy . 
" Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son ? " said Fred , looking at Malfoy with dislike . 
" Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team . " 
Seven highly polished , brand - new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors ' noses in the early morning sun . 
As for the old Cleansweeps " — he smiled nastily at Fred and George , who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives — " sweeps the board with them . " 
None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment . 
Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits . 
" Oh , look , " said Flint . 
" A field invasion . " 
Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on . 
" What's happening ? " 
Ron asked Harry . 
" Why aren't you playing ? 
And what's he doing here ? " 
He was looking at Malfoy , taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes . 
" I'm the new Slytherin Seeker , Weasley , " said Malfoy , smugly . 
Ron gaped , openmouthed , at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him . 
" Good , aren't they ? " said Malfoy smoothly . 
" But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms , too . 
" At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in , " said Hermione sharply . 
" They got in on pure talent . " 
The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered . 
Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words . 
Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him , Alicia shrieked , " How dare you ! " , and Ron plunged his hand into his robes , pulled out his wand , yelling , " You ' ll pay for that one , Malfoy ! " and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoy's face . 
A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand , hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass . 
" Ron ! Ron ! Are you all right ? " 
squealed Hermione . 
Ron opened his mouth to speak , but no words came out . 
Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap . 
Malfoy was on all fours , banging the ground with his fist . 
Nobody seemed to want to touch him . 
" We'd better get him to Hagrid's , it's nearest , " said Harry to Hermione , who nodded bravely , and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms . 
" What happened , Harry ? 
What happened ? 
" Can you hold him still , Harry ? " " Get out of the way , Colin ! " said Harry angrily . 
He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest . 
" It's a simple matter if you know what you ' re doing ! " Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid . 
" If you need help , you know where I am ! I ' ll let you have a copy of my book . 
I'm surprised you haven't already got one — I ' ll sign one tonight and send it over . 
Well , good - bye ! " 
And he strode away toward the castle . 
Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight , then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid's front door . 
" Bin wonderin ' when you'd come ter see me — come in , come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again — " Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one - roomed cabin , which had an enormous bed in one corner , a fire crackling merrily in the other . 
" Better out than in , " he said cheerfully , plunking a large copper basin in front of him . 
" What did Lockhart want with you , Hagrid ? " 
Harry asked , scratching Fang's ears . 
Hagrid , moving a half - plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot . 
" Like I don ' know . 
Hermione , however , said in a voice somewhat higher than usual , " I think you ' re being a bit unfair . 
Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job — " " He was the on ' y man for the job , " said Hagrid , offering them a plate of treacle toffee , while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin . 
" He didn ' ! " he growled at Hermione . 
" He did , " she said . 
" But I don't know what it means . 
He gave a small burp , and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand . 
He threw it into the basin and continued , " I mean , the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all . 
It's ridiculous . 
" I have not been giving out signed photos , " he said hotly . 
But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing . 
" I'm on ' y jokin ' , " he said , patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table . 
" An'then I told him I'd never read one o ' his books an ' he decided ter go . 
Treacle toffee , Ron ? " he added as Ron reappeared . 
" No thanks , " said Ron weakly . 
" Better not risk it . " 
" Come an'see what I ' ve bin growin ' , " said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea . 
In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen . 
Each was the size of a large boulder . 
" What ' ve you been feeding them ? " said Harry . 
Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone . 
Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked ; in fact , he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it . 
Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic . 
He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year , but Harry had never found out why — any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed . 
" Well , you ' ve done a good job on them . " 
" That's what yer little sister said , " said Hagrid , nodding at Ron . " Met her jus ' yesterday . " 
Hagrid looked sideways at Harry , his beard twitching . 
" Said she was jus ' lookin ' round the grounds , but I reckon she was hopin'she might run inter someone else at my house . " 
He winked at Harry . 
Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs . 
" Watch it ! " 
Hagrid roared , pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins . 
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn , he was keen to go back to school to eat . 
They said good - bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle , Ron hiccoughing occasionally , but only bringing up two very small slugs . 
" You will both do your detentions this evening . " 
" You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" And no magic , Weasley — elbow grease . " 
Ron gulped . 
Argus Filch , the caretaker , was loathed by every student in the school . 
" And you , Potter , will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Certainly not , " said Professor McGonagall , raising her eyebrows . 
" Professor Lockhart requested you particularly . 
Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as much as he'd thought . 
Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal . 
" No magic ! 
" I'd swap anytime , " said Harry hollowly . 
Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away , and in what seemed like no time , it was five minutes to eight , and Harry was dragging his feet along the second - floor corridor to Lockhart's office . 
He gritted his teeth and knocked . 
Lockhart beamed down at him . 
" Ah , here's the scalawag ! " he said . 
" Come in , Harry , come in — " Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart . 
" This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon , bless her — huge fan of mine — " The minutes snailed by . 
The candles burned lower and lower , making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him . 
And then he heard something — something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans . 
It was a voice , a voice to chill the bone marrow , a voice of breathtaking , ice - cold venom . 
" Come . . . 
come to me . . . . 
Let me rip you . . . . 
Let me tear you . . . . 
Let me kill you . . . 
Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street . 
" What ? " he said loudly . 
" I know ! " said Lockhart . 
" Six solid months at the top of the best - seller list ! 
Broke all records ! " " No , " said Harry frantically . 
" That voice ! " " Sorry ? " said Lockhart , looking puzzled . 
" What voice ? " " That — that voice that said — didn't you hear it ? " 
" What are you talking about , Harry ? 
Great Scott — look at the time ! 
" We ' ve been here nearly four hours ! 
I'd never have believed it — the time's flown , hasn't it ? " 
Harry didn't answer . 
He was straining his ears to hear the voice again , but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention . 
Feeling dazed , Harry left . 
It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty . 
Harry went straight up to the dormitory . 
Half an hour later , Ron arrived , nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room . 
Took ages to get the slime off . . . . 
Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville , Dean , and Seamus , Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard . 
" And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it ? " said Ron . 
Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight . 
" D ' you think he was lying ? 
" I know , " said Harry , lying back in his four - poster and staring at the canopy above him . 
" I don't get it either . " 
October arrived , spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle . 
Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students . 
The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire . 
Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end ; the lake rose , the flower beds turned into muddy streams , and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds . 
Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions , however , was not dampened , which was why Harry was to be found , late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween , returning to Gryffindor Tower , drenched to the skin and splattered with mud . 
Fred and George , who had been spying on the Slytherin team , had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones . 
They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs , shooting through the air like missiles . 
As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was . 
. " " Hello , Nick , " said Harry . 
He wore a dashing , plumed hat on his long curly hair , and a tunic with a ruff , which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed . 
He was pale as smoke , and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside . 
" So do you , " said Harry . 
Thought I'd apply , but apparently I'don't fulfill requirements ' — " In spite of his airy tone , there was a look of great bitterness on his face . 
" But you would think , wouldn't you , " he erupted suddenly , pulling the letter back out of his pocket , " that getting hit forty - five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt ? " 
" Oh — yes , " said Harry , who was obviously supposed to agree . 
However — " Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously : 
" ' We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies . 
It is with the greatest regret , therefore , that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements . 
With very best wishes , Sir Patrick Delaney - Podmore . ' " 
Anything I can do ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly — " The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high - pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles . 
He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp - like yellow eyes . 
It was Mrs . Norris , the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker , Argus Filch , as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students . 
" You'd better get out of here , Harry , " said Nick quickly . 
Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat , Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right , wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule - breaker . 
There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head , and his nose was unusually purple . 
" Filth ! " he shouted , his jowls aquiver , his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes . 
I ' ve had enough of it , I tell you ! 
Follow me , Potter ! " 
So Harry waved a gloomy good - bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs , doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor . 
Harry had never been inside Filch's office before ; it was a place most students avoided . 
The room was dingy and windowless , lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling . 
A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place . 
Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls ; from their labels , Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished . 
Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves . 
A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk . 
I ' ve had enough of it . . . 
where's the form . . . 
yes . . 
He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him , dipping his long black quill into the ink pot . 
" Name . . . 
Harry Potter . 
. " " It was only a bit of mud ! " said Harry . 
" It's only a bit of mud to you , boy , but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing ! " 
shouted Filch , a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose . 
befouling the castle . . . 
suggested sentence . . 
Dabbing at his streaming nose , Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry , who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall . 
But as Filch lowered his quill , there was a great BANG ! on the ceiling of the office , which made the oil lamp rattle . 
" I ' ll have you this time , I ' ll have you ! " 
Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back , Harry sank into a moth - eaten chair next to the desk . 
There was only one thing on it apart from his half - completed form : a large , glossy , purple envelope with silver lettering on the front . 
With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back , Harry picked up the envelope and read : 
Intrigued , Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside . 
More curly silver writing on the front page said : 
Feel out of step in the world of modern magic ? 
There is an answer ! 
Kwikspell is an all - new , fail - safe , quick - result , easy - learn course . 
Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method ! 
Now , after a Kwikspell course , I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution ! " 
Warlock D . J . Prod of Didsbury says : " My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms , but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak ! Thank you , Kwikspell ! " 
Fascinated , Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents . 
Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope , Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened . 
" That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable ! " he was saying gleefully to Mrs . Norris . 
Filch's pasty face went brick red . 
Filch hobbled across to his desk , snatched up the envelope , and threw it into a drawer . 
" Have you — did you read — ? " he sputtered . 
" No , " Harry lied quickly . 
Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together . 
" If I thought you'd read my private — not that it's mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — " Harry was staring at him , alarmed ; Filch had never looked madder . 
His eyes were popping , a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks , and the tartan scarf didn't help . 
" Very well — go — and don't breathe a word — not that — however , if you didn't read — go now , I have to write up Peeves ' report — go — " 
Amazed at his luck , Harry sped out of the office , up the corridor , and back upstairs . 
" Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Thanks , Nick ! " 
They set off up the corridor together . 
Nearly Headless Nick , Harry noticed , was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter . 
" I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt , " Harry said . 
" But there is something you could do for me , " said Nick excitedly . 
" Harry — would I be asking too much — but no , you wouldn't want — " " What is it ? " said Harry . 
" Right . " 
" I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons . 
He watched Harry on tenterhooks . 
" No , " said Harry quickly , " I ' ll come — " " My dear boy ! 
Harry Potter , at my deathday party ! 
" A deathday party ? " said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room . 
The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading , talking , doing homework or , in the case of Fred and George Weasley , trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander . 
Fred had " rescued " the brilliant orange , fire - dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people . 
Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air , emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room . 
The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George , the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth , and its escape into the fire , with accompanying explosions , drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind . 
By the time Halloween arrived , Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party . 
The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast ; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats , Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in , and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment . 
" You said you'd go to the deathday party . " 
So at seven o ' clock , Harry , Ron , and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall , which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles , and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons . 
" Is that supposed to be music ? " 
Ron whispered . 
They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes . 
" My dear friends , " he said mournfully . 
" Welcome , welcome . . . 
so pleased you could come . . . 
He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside . 
It was an incredible sight . 
The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly - white , translucent people , mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor , waltzing to the dreadful , quavering sound of thirty musical saws , played by an orchestra on a raised , black - draped platform . 
" Shall we have a look around ? " 
Harry suggested , wanting to warm up his feet . 
" Careful not to walk through anyone , " said Ron nervously , and they set off around the edge of the dance floor . 
They passed a group of gloomy nuns , a ragged man wearing chains , and the Fat Friar , a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost , who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead . 
Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron , a gaunt , staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains , was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts . 
" Oh , no , " said Hermione , stopping abruptly . 
" Turn back , turn back , I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle — " " Who ? " said Harry as they backtracked quickly . 
" She haunts one of the toilets in the girls ' bathroom on the first floor , " said Hermione . 
" She haunts a toilet ? " 
" Yes . 
I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it ; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you — " " Look , food ! " said Ron . 
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table , also covered in black velvet . 
Large , rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters ; cakes , burned charcoal - black , were heaped on salvers ; there was a great maggoty haggis , a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and , in pride of place , an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone , with tar - like icing forming the words , 
" Can you taste it if you walk through it ? " 
Harry asked him . 
" Almost , " said the ghost sadly , and he drifted away . 
I feel sick , " said Ron . 
" Hello , Peeves , " said Harry cautiously . 
Unlike the ghosts around them , Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent . 
He was wearing a bright orange party hat , a revolving bow tie , and a broad grin on his wide , wicked face . 
" No thanks , " said Hermione . 
" I didn't mean it , I don't mind her — er , hello , Myrtle . " 
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over . 
" What ? " she said sulkily . 
" How are you , Myrtle ? " said Hermione in a falsely bright voice . 
" It's nice to see you out of the toilet . " 
Myrtle sniffed . 
" Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight , " said Hermione , glaring at Peeves . 
Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously . 
" D ' you think I don't know what people call me behind my back ? 
Fat Myrtle ! 
Ugly Myrtle ! 
Pimply ! " " Oh , dear , " said Hermione sadly . 
The orchestra , however , stopped playing at that very moment . 
They , and everyone else in the dungeon , fell silent , looking around in excitement , as a hunting horn sounded . 
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses , each ridden by a headless horseman . 
The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted , rearing and plunging . 
At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm , from which position he was blowing the horn . 
The ghost leapt down , lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd ( everyone laughed ) , and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick , squashing his head back onto his neck . 
" Nick ! " he roared . 
" How are you ? 
" Don't mind Nick ! " shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor . 
" My late lamented lords , ladies , and gentlemen , it is my great sorrow . . 
Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch . 
" I can't stand much more of this , " Ron muttered , his teeth chattering , as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor . 
" Let's go , " Harry agreed . 
They backed toward the door , nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them , and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles . 
" Pudding might not be finished yet , " said Ron hopefully , leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall . 
And then Harry heard it . 
tear . . . 
kill . . 
It was the same voice , the same cold , murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office . 
He stumbled to a halt , clutching at the stone wall , listening with all his might , looking around , squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway . 
for so long . . 
. " " Listen ! " said Harry urgently , and Ron and Hermione froze , watching him . 
kill . . . 
time to kill . . 
The voice was growing fainter . 
Harry was sure it was moving away — moving upward . 
A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling ; how could it be moving upward ? 
" This way , " he shouted , and he began to run , up the stairs , into the entrance hall . 
It was no good hoping to hear anything here , the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall . 
Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor , Ron and Hermione clattering behind him . 
Harry strained his ears . 
Distantly , from the floor above , and growing fainter still , he heard the voice : " . . . 
I smell blood . . . . 
I SMELL BLOOD ! " His stomach lurched — " It's going to kill someone ! " he shouted , and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces , he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time , trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps — Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor , Ron and Hermione panting behind him , not stopping until they turned a corner into the last , deserted passage . 
" I couldn't hear anything . . . 
But Hermione gave a sudden gasp , pointing down the corridor . 
" Look ! " Something was shining on the wall ahead . 
They approached slowly , squinting through the darkness . 
Foot - high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows , shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches . 
" What's that thing — hanging underneath ? " said Ron , a slight quiver in his voice . 
As they edged nearer , Harry almost slipped — there was a large puddle of water on the floor ; Ron and Hermione grabbed him , and they inched toward the message , eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it . 
Mrs . Norris , the caretaker's cat , was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket . 
She was stiff as a board , her eyes wide and staring . 
Then Ron said , " Let's get out of here . " 
But it was too late . 
From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs , and the loud , happy talk of well - fed people ; next moment , students were crashing into the passage from both ends . 
The chatter , the bustle , the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood alone , in the middle of the corridor , as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight . 
" Enemies of the Heir , beware ! 
It was Draco Malfoy . 
He had pushed to the front of the crowd , his cold eyes alive , his usually bloodless face flushed , as he grinned at the sight of the hanging , immobile cat . 
What's going on here ? 
What's going on ? " Attracted no doubt by Malfoy's shout , Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd . 
" My cat ! 
My cat ! What's happened to Mrs . Norris ? " he shrieked . 
" You ! " he screeched . 
" You ! 
You ' ve murdered my cat ! You ' ve killed her ! I ' ll kill you ! 
I ' ll — " " Argus ! " 
In seconds , he had swept past Harry , Ron , and Hermione and detached Mrs . Norris from the torch bracket . 
" You , too , Mr. Potter , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger . " 
Lockhart stepped forward eagerly . 
Lockhart , looking excited and important , hurried after Dumbledore ; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape . 
As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls ; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight , their hair in rollers . 
The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back . 
Dumbledore laid Mrs . Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight , watching . 
The tip of Dumbledore's long , crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs . Norris's fur . 
Snape loomed behind them , half in shadow , wearing a most peculiar expression : It was as though he was trying hard not to smile . 
" It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably the Transmogrifian Torture — I ' ve seen it used many times , so unlucky I wasn't there , I know the very countercurse that would have saved her . . . 
Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry , racking sobs . 
He was slumped in a chair by the desk , unable to look at Mrs . Norris , his face in his hands . 
If Dumbledore believed Filch , he would be expelled for sure . 
I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou , " said Lockhart , " a series of attacks , the full story's in my autobiography , I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets , which cleared the matter up at once . . . 
At last Dumbledore straightened up . 
" She's not dead , Argus , " he said softly . 
Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented . 
I thought so ! " said Lockhart ) . 
" But how , I cannot say . . . 
. " " Ask him ! " shrieked Filch , turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry . 
" No second year could have done this , " said Dumbledore firmly . 
Filch spat , his pouchy face purpling . 
He found — in my office — he knows I'm a — I'm a — " Filch's face worked horribly . 
" He knows I'm a Squib ! " he finished . 
" I never touched Mrs . Norris ! " 
Harry said loudly , uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him , including all the Lockharts on the walls . 
" And I don't even know what a Squib is . " " Rubbish ! " 
snarled Filch . 
" Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time , " he said , a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it . 
" But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here . 
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party . 
there were hundreds of ghosts , they ' ll tell you we were there — " " But why not join the feast afterward ? " said Snape , his black eyes glittering in the candlelight . 
" Why go up to that corridor ? " 
Ron and Hermione looked at Harry . 
" Because — because — " Harry said , his heart thumping very fast ; something told him it would sound very far - fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear , " because we were tired and wanted to go to bed , " he said . 
" It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story . 
I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest . " 
" Really , Severus , " said Professor McGonagall sharply , " I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch . 
There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong . " 
Snape looked furious . 
So did Filch . 
" I want to see some punishment ! " " We will be able to cure her , Argus , " said Dumbledore patiently . 
" Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes . 
" I must have done it a hundred times . 
" But I believe I am the Potions master at this school . " 
" You may go , " Dumbledore said to Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office , they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them . 
" D ' you think I should have told them about that voice I heard ? " " No , " said Ron , without hesitation . 
" Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign , even in the wizarding world . " 
Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask , " You do believe me , don't you ? " " ' Course I do , " said Ron quickly . 
" But — you must admit it's weird . . . 
. " " I know it's weird , " said Harry . 
What was that writing on the wall about ? 
" I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once . . . 
might ' ve been Bill . . . 
. " " And what on earth's a Squib ? " said Harry . 
" Well — it's not funny really — but as it's Filch , " he said . 
" A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers . 
If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course , I reckon he must be a Squib . 
" He's bitter . " 
A clock chimed somewhere . 
" Midnight , " said Harry . 
For a few days , the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs . Norris . 
Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked , as though he thought the attacker might come back . 
Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs . Skower's All - Purpose Magical Mess Remover , but to no effect ; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone . 
When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime , he was skulking red - eyed through the corridors , lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like " breathing loudly " and " looking happy . " 
According to Ron , she was a great cat lover . 
" Honestly , we ' re much better off without her . " 
Ginny's lip trembled . 
" Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts , " Ron assured her . 
I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled . 
The attack had also had an effect on Hermione . 
It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading , but she was now doing almost nothing else . 
Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to , and not until the following Wednesday did they find out . 
Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him , turned abruptly , and sped off in the opposite direction . 
Harry found Ron at the back of the library , measuring his History of Magic homework . 
" I don't believe it , I'm still eight inches short . . . 
" Somewhere over there , " said Ron , pointing along the shelves . 
" Looking for another book . 
I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas . " 
Harry told Ron about Justin Finch - Fletchley running away from him . 
I thought he was a bit of an idiot , " said Ron , scribbling away , making his writing as large as possible . 
She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them . 
" All the copies of Hogwarts , A History have been taken out , " she said , sitting down next to Harry and Ron . 
" And there's a two - week waiting list . 
I wish I hadn't left my copy at home , but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books . " 
" Why do you want it ? " said Harry . 
" The same reason everyone else wants it , " said Hermione , " to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets . " 
" What's that ? " said Harry quickly . 
" That's just it . 
I can't remember , " said Hermione , biting her lip . 
" No , I won't , " said Hermione , suddenly severe . 
Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic , bickering . 
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule . 
Professor Binns , who taught it , was their only ghost teacher , and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard . 
Ancient and shriveled , many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead . 
He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire ; his routine had not varied in the slightest since . 
Today was as boring as ever . 
Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor , occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date , then falling asleep again . 
He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before . 
Hermione put up her hand . 
Professor Binns , glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec - 
ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289 , looked amazed . 
I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets , " said Hermione in a clear voice . 
Dean Thomas , who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open , gazing out of the window , jerked out of his trance ; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk . 
Professor Binns blinked . 
" My subject is History of Magic , " he said in his dry , wheezy voice . 
He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk snapping and continued , " In September of that year , a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers — " He stuttered to a halt . 
Hermione's hand was waving in the air again . 
He looked dimly at them all , every face turned to his . 
" Oh , very well , " he said slowly . 
" Let me see . . . the Chamber of Secrets . . . 
" You all know , of course , that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age . 
He paused , gazed blearily around the room , and continued . 
" For a few years , the founders worked in harmony together , seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated . 
Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts . 
After a while , there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor , and Slytherin left the school . " 
Professor Binns paused again , pursing his lips , looking like a wrinkled old tortoise . 
" But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets . 
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle , of which the other founders knew nothing . 
" Slytherin , according to the legend , sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school . 
The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets , unleash the horror within , and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic . " 
Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed . 
" Naturally , the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber , many times , by the most learned witches and wizards . 
It does not exist . 
Hermione's hand was back in the air . 
" Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ' horror within'the Chamber ? " " That is believed to be some sort of monster , which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control , " said Professor Binns in his dry , reedy voice . 
" There is no Chamber and no monster . " 
" That will do , " he said sharply . 
" It is a myth ! 
It does not exist ! 
There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard ! 
I regret telling you such a foolish story ! 
We will return , if you please , to history , to solid , believable , verifiable fact ! " 
" I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony , " Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner . 
Honestly , if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin , I'd ' ve got the train straight back home . . . 
Hermione nodded fervently , but Harry didn't say anything . 
His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly . 
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin . 
He could remember , as though it were yesterday , the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before : You could be great , you know , it's all here in your head , and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that . . . . 
But Harry , who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputation for turning out Dark wizards , had thought desperately , Not Slytherin ! 
" Hiya , Harry ! " " Hullo , Colin , " said Harry automatically . 
" Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you ' re — " But Colin was so small he couldn't fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall ; they heard him squeak , " See you , Harry ! " and he was gone . 
" That I'm Slytherin's heir , I expect , " said Harry , his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch - Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime . 
" People here ' ll believe anything , " said Ron in disgust . 
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty . 
" D ' you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets ? " Ron asked Hermione . 
" I don't know , " she said , frowning . 
Mrs . Norris , and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be — well — human . " 
As she spoke , they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened . 
They stopped and looked . 
The scene was just as it had been that night , except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket , and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message " The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened . " 
They looked at each other . 
The corridor was deserted . 
" Scorch marks ! " he said . 
" Here — and here — " " Come and look at this ! " said Hermione . 
" This is funny . . . 
Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall . 
Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane , where around twenty spiders were scuttling , apparently fighting to get through a small crack . 
A long , silvery thread was dangling like a rope , as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside . 
" Have you ever seen spiders act like that ? " said Hermione wonderingly . 
" No , " said Harry , " have you , Ron ? Ron ? " 
He looked over his shoulder . 
Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run . 
" What's up ? " said Harry . 
" I — don't — like — spiders , " said Ron tensely . 
" I just don't like the way they move . . . 
Hermione giggled . 
" It's not funny , " said Ron , fiercely . 
" If you must know , when I was three , Fred turned my — my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick . . . . 
Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh . 
Feeling they had better get off the subject , Harry said , " Remember all that water on the floor ? 
Someone's mopped it up . " 
" It was about here , " said Ron , recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing . 
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he'd been burned . 
" What's the matter ? " said Harry . 
" Can't go in there , " said Ron gruffly . 
" That's a girls ' toilet . " 
" That's Moaning Myrtle's place . 
Come on , let's have a look . " 
And ignoring the large out of order sign , she opened the door . 
It was the gloomiest , most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in . 
Under a large , cracked , and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks . 
The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles , burning low in their holders ; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges . 
Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall . 
Harry and Ron went to look . 
Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet , picking a spot on her chin . 
" This is a girls ' bathroom , " she said , eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously . 
" They're not girls . " 
" No , " Hermione agreed . 
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor . 
" Ask her if she saw anything , " Harry mouthed at Hermione . 
" What are you whispering ? " said Myrtle , staring at him . 
" Nothing , " said Harry quickly . 
" I do have feelings , you know , even if I am dead — " " Myrtle , no one wants to upset you , " said Hermione . 
" Harry only — " " No one wants to upset me ! 
That's a good one ! " 
howled Myrtle . 
" Did you see anyone near here that night ? " said Harry . 
" Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself . 
Then , of course , I remembered that I'm — that I'm — " " Already dead , " said Ron helpfully . 
Myrtle gave a tragic sob , rose up in the air , turned over , and dived headfirst into the toilet , splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight , although from the direction of her muffled sobs , she had come to rest somewhere in the U - bend . 
Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open , but Hermione shrugged wearily and said , " Honestly , that was almost cheerful for Myrtle . . . . 
Come on , let's go . " 
" RON ! " Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs , prefect badge agleam , an expression of complete shock on his face . 
" Don't you care what this looks like ? 
" And I hope it teaches you a lesson ! 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night . 
When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges , it ignited the parchment . 
she said in a quiet voice , as though continuing a conversation they had just been having . 
" Let's think , " said Ron in mock puzzlement . 
He looked at Hermione . 
Hermione looked back , unconvinced . 
" Look at his family , " said Harry , closing his books , too . 
" They could ' ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries ! " said Ron . " Handing it down , father to son . . . 
. " " Well , " said Hermione cautiously , " I suppose it's possible . . . 
. " " But how do we prove it ? " said Harry darkly . 
" Of course , it would be difficult . 
And dangerous , very dangerous . 
" All right , " said Hermione coldly . 
" What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us . " 
" But that's impossible , " Harry said as Ron laughed . 
" No , it's not , " said Hermione . 
" What's that ? " said Ron and Harry together . 
" Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — " " D ' you think we ' ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape ? " muttered Ron . 
Think about it ! 
We could change into three of the Slytherins . 
No one would know it was us . 
Malfoy would probably tell us anything . 
He's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now , if only we could hear him . " 
Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library . " 
There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section : You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher . 
" Hard to see why we'd want the book , really , " said Ron , " if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions . " 
" I think , " said Hermione , " that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory , we might stand a chance . . . 
Since the disastrous episode of the pixies , Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class . 
He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions ; so far , Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse , a yeti with a head cold , and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him . 
Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson , this time acting a werewolf . 
If he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood , he would have refused to do it . 
" Nice loud howl , Harry — exactly — and then , if you ' ll believe it , I pounced — like this — slammed him to the floor — thus — with one hand , I managed to hold him down — with my other , I 
put my wand to his throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm — he let out a piteous moan — go on , Harry — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man . 
The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet . 
" Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf ! 
Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one ! " 
The class began to leave . 
Harry returned to the back of the room , where Ron and Hermione were waiting . 
" Ready ? " 
Harry muttered . 
" Wait till everyone's gone , " said Hermione nervously . 
" All right . . 
She approached Lockhart's desk , a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand , Harry and Ron right behind her . 
" Er — Professor Lockhart ? " 
Hermione stammered . 
" I wanted to — to get this book out of the library . 
She held out the piece of paper , her hand shaking slightly . 
" But the thing is , it's in the Restricted Section of the library , so I need a teacher to sign for it — I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow - acting venoms — " " Ah , Gadding with Ghouls ! " said Lockhart , taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her . " Possibly my very favorite book . 
You enjoyed it ? " 
" Oh , yes , " said Hermione eagerly . 
" So clever , the way you trapped that last one with the tea - strainer — " " Well , I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help , " said Lockhart warmly , and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill . 
" So , Harry , " said Lockhart , while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag . 
" Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season , I believe ? 
Gryffindor against Slytherin , is it not ? 
I hear you ' re a useful player . 
I was a Seeker , too . 
I was asked to try for the National Squad , but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces . 
Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players . . . 
Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione . 
" I don't believe it , " he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note . 
" He didn't even look at the book we wanted . " 
" Just because he said you were the best student of the year — " They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library . 
Madam Pince , the librarian , was a thin , irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture . 
" I was wondering if I could keep it , " she said breathlessly . 
Madam Pince held the note up to the light , as though determined to detect a forgery , but it passed the test . 
Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left , trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty . 
Five minutes later , they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out - of - order bathroom once again . 
Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully , and the three of them bent over the damp - spotted pages . 
Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about , and there were some very unpleasant illustrations , which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head . 
It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people . 
Harry sin - 
cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces . 
" This is the most complicated potion I ' ve ever seen , " said Hermione as they scanned the recipe . 
" Lacewing flies , leeches , fluxweed , and knotgrass , " she murmured , running her finger down the list of ingredients . 
Oooh , look , powdered horn of a bicorn — don't know where we ' re going to get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that ' ll be tricky , too — and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into . " 
" Excuse me ? " said Ron sharply . 
Ron turned , speechless , to Harry , who had another worry . 
" D ' you realize how much we ' re going to have to steal , Hermione ? 
What ' re we going to do , break into Snape's private stores ? 
Hermione shut the book with a snap . 
" Well , if you two are going to chicken out , fine , " she said . 
There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual . 
" I don't want to break rules , you know . 
I think threatening Muggle - borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion . 
But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy , I ' ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in — " 
" Well , since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty - one days . . . 
Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match . 
He was nervous , mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost , but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy . 
He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly . 
After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning , he got up , dressed , and went down to breakfast early , where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long , empty table , all looking uptight and not speaking much . 
As eleven o ' clock approached , the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium . 
It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air . 
Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms . 
The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes , then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre - match pep talk . 
" Slytherin has better brooms than us , " he began . 
" No point denying it . 
But we ' ve got better people on our brooms . 
Chest heaving with emotion , Wood turned to Harry . 
" It ' ll be down to you , Harry , to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father . 
Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying , Harry , because we ' ve got to win today , we ' ve got to . " 
" So no pressure , Harry , " said Fred , winking at him . 
As they walked out onto the field , a roar of noise greeted them ; mainly cheers , because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten , but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard , too . 
" On my whistle , " said Madam Hooch . 
" Three . . . 
two . . . 
one . . 
With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward , the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky . 
Harry flew higher than any of them , squinting around for the Snitch . 
" All right there , Scarhead ? " 
Harry had no time to reply . 
" Close one , Harry ! " said George , streaking past him with his club in his hand , ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin . 
Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey , but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again . 
Harry dropped quickly to avoid it , and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy . 
Once again , the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head . 
Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the field . 
He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him . 
What was going on ? 
Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end . 
Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might ; the Bludger was knocked off course . 
" Gotcha ! " Fred yelled happily , but he was wrong ; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry , the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed . 
It had started to rain ; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face , splattering onto his glasses . 
He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan , who was commentating , say , " Slytherin lead , sixty points to zero — " 
The Slytherins'superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs , and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air . 
Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch , let alone catch it . 
" We need time out , " said George , trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time . 
Wood had obviously got the message . 
Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry , Fred , and George dived for the ground , still trying to avoid the mad Bludger . 
" What's going on ? " said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together , while Slytherins in the crowd jeered . 
" Someone's fixed it — it won't leave Harry alone . 
The Slytherins must have done something to it . " 
" But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice , and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . 
. " said Wood , anxiously . 
Madam Hooch was walking toward them . 
Over her shoulder , Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction . 
" Listen , " said Harry as she came nearer and nearer , " with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve . 
Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one . " 
Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys . 
" Oliver , this is insane , " said Alicia Spinnet angrily . 
Let's ask for an inquiry — " " If we stop now , we ' ll have to forfeit the match ! " said Harry . 
" And we ' re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger ! 
Come on , Oliver , tell them to leave me alone ! " 
" This is all your fault , " George said angrily to Wood . 
" Ready to resume play ? " 
she asked Wood . 
Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face . 
" All right , " he said . 
" Fred , George , you heard Harry — leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own . " 
On Madam Hooch's whistle , Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him . 
Higher and higher Harry climbed ; he looped and swooped , spiraled , zigzagged , and rolled . 
Slightly dizzy , he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open , rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down , avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger . 
He could hear laughter from the crowd ; he knew he must look very stupid , but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could ; he began a kind of roller - coaster ride around the edges of the stadium , squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts , where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again ; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction . 
" Training for the ballet , Potter ? " yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger , and he fled , the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him ; and then , glaring back at Malfoy in hatred , he saw it — the Golden Snitch . 
It was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear — and Malfoy , busy laughing at Harry , hadn't seen it . 
The Bludger had hit him at last , smashed into his elbow , and Harry felt his arm break . 
Dimly , dazed by the searing pain in his arm , he slid sideways on his rain - drenched broom , one knee still crooked over it , his right arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack , this time aiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way , one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain : get to Malfoy . 
" What the — " he gasped , careening out of Harry's way . 
Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch ; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs , and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground , trying hard not to pass out . 
He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand . 
" Aha , " he said vaguely . 
" We ' ve won . " 
And he fainted . 
He came around , rain falling on his face , still lying on the field , with someone leaning over him . 
He saw a glitter of teeth . 
" Oh , no , not you , " he moaned . 
" Not to worry , Harry . 
" No ! " said Harry . 
" I ' ll keep it like this , thanks . . . 
He tried to sit up , but the pain was terrible . 
" Lie back , Harry , " said Lockhart soothingly . 
It was still putting up a terrific fight . 
" No — don't — " said Harry weakly , but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm . 
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips . 
He had shut his eyes , his face turned away from his arm , but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly . 
" Ah , " said Lockhart . 
" Yes . 
But the point is , the bones are no longer broken . 
That's the thing to bear in mind . 
Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side . 
He tried to move his fingers . 
Nothing happened . 
Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones . 
" I ' ll be able to , certainly , but it will be painful , " said Madam Pomfrey grimly , throwing Harry a pair of pajamas . 
" You ' ll have to stay the night . . . 
Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas . 
It took a while to stuff the rubbery , boneless arm into a sleeve . 
" If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked . " 
" Anyone can make a mistake , " said Hermione . 
" And it doesn't hurt anymore , does it , Harry ? " " No , " said Harry , getting into bed . 
As he swung himself onto the bed , his arm flapped pointlessly . 
Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain . 
Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele - Gro . 
It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it went down , making him cough and splutter . 
treated , leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water . 
" That was some catch you made . 
Malfoy's face . . . he looked ready to kill . . . 
. " " I want to know how he fixed that Bludger , " said Hermione darkly . 
" We can add that to the list of questions we ' ll ask him when we ' ve taken the Polyjuice Potion , " said Harry , sinking back onto his pillows . 
" I hope it tastes better than this stuff . . . 
. " " If it's got bits of Slytherins in it ? 
You ' ve got to be joking , " said Ron . 
The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment . 
Filthy and soaking wet , the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry . 
" Unbelievable flying , Harry , " said George . 
" I ' ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy . 
Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing . 
They had brought cakes , sweets , and bottles of pumpkin juice ; they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over , shouting , " This boy needs rest , he's got thirty - three bones to regrow ! 
And Harry was left alone , with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm . 
For a second , he thought that was what had woken him . 
Then , with a thrill of horror , he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark . 
" Get off ! " he said loudly , and then , " Dobby ! " 
A single tear was running down his long , pointed nose . 
" Harry Potter came back to school , " he whispered miserably . 
" Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter . 
Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train ? " 
Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge away . 
" What ' re you doing here ? " he said . 
" And how did you know I missed the train ? " 
" It was you ! " he said slowly . 
" Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward " — he showed Harry ten long , bandaged fingers — " but Dobby didn't care , sir , for he thought Harry Potter was safe , and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way ! " 
He was rocking backward and forward , shaking his ugly head . 
" Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts , he let his master's dinner burn ! 
Harry slumped back onto his pillows . 
" You nearly got Ron and me expelled , " he said fiercely . 
Dobby smiled weakly . 
" Dobby is used to death threats , sir . 
Dobby gets them five times a day at home . " 
He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore , looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself . 
" Why d ' you wear that thing , Dobby ? " he asked curiously . 
Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly , " Harry Potter must go home ! 
" What d ' you mean , your Bludger ? 
You made that Bludger try and kill me ? " " Not kill you , sir , never kill you ! " said Dobby , shocked . 
" Dobby wants to save Harry Potter's life ! 
Better sent home , grievously injured , than remain here , sir ! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home ! " " Oh , is that all ? " said Harry angrily . 
" If he knew what he means to us , to the lowly , the enslaved , we dregs of the magical world ! 
Of course , Dobby is still treated like that , sir , " he admitted , drying his face on the pillowcase . 
Harry Potter survived , and the Dark Lord's power was broken , and it was a new dawn , sir , and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end , sir . . . . 
A second later , he crawled back onto the bed , cross - eyed , muttering , " Bad Dobby , very bad Dobby . . 
. " " So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" And — did you say it's been opened before ? 
Tell me , Dobby ! " 
He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the water jug . 
" But I'm not Muggle - born — how can I be in danger from the Chamber ? " " Ah , sir , ask no more , ask no more of poor Dobby , " stammered the elf , his eyes huge in the dark . 
" Dark deeds are planned in this place , but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen — go home , Harry Potter , go home . 
Harry Potter must not meddle in this , sir , ' tis too dangerous — " " Who is it , Dobby ? " 
Harry said , keeping a firm hold on Dobby's wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again . 
" Who's opened it ? 
Who opened it last time ? " 
" Dobby can't , sir , Dobby can't , Dobby mustn't tell ! " squealed the elf . 
" Go home , Harry Potter , go home ! " " I'm not going anywhere ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" One of my best friends is Muggle - born ; she ' ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened — " " Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends ! " moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy . 
" So noble ! 
So valiant ! 
But he must save himself , he must , Harry Potter must not — " Dobby suddenly froze , his bat ears quivering . 
Harry heard it , too . 
There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside . 
" Dobby must go ! " breathed the elf , terrified . 
There was a loud crack , and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air . 
He slumped back into bed , his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer . 
He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue . 
" Get Madam Pomfrey , " whispered Dumbledore , and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight . 
Harry lay quite still , pretending to be asleep . 
" What happened ? " 
Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore , bending over the statue on the bed . 
" There was a bunch of grapes next to him , " said Professor McGonagall . 
Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch . 
Slowly and carefully , he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed . 
It was Colin Creevey . 
His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him , holding his camera . 
" Yes , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" But I shudder to think . . . 
Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip . 
" You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker ? " said Professor McGonagall eagerly . 
Dumbledore didn't answer . 
He opened the back of the camera . 
" Good gracious ! " said Madam Pomfrey . 
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera . 
Harry , three beds away , caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic . 
" Melted , " said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly . 
" All melted . . 
. " " What does this mean , Albus ? " Professor McGonagall asked urgently . 
" It means , " said Dumbledore , " that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again . " 
Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth . 
Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore . 
" But , Albus . . . 
" The question is , how . . . 
And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shadowy face , she didn't understand this any better than he did . 
Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff . 
" When you ' ve finished eating , you may leave . " 
Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower , desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby , but they weren't there . 
" Oh , hello , Harry , " he said . 
Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points ! " " You haven't seen Ron or Hermione , have you ? " said Harry . 
" No , I haven't , " said Percy , his smile fading . 
" I hope Ron's not in another girls ' toilet . . . 
There was a clunk , a splash , and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye peering through the keyhole . 
" Harry ! " she said . 
An old cauldron was perched on the toilet , and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it . 
" We'd ' ve come to meet you , but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion , " Ron explained as Harry , with difficulty , locked the stall again . 
" We ' ve decided this is the safest place to hide it . " 
Harry started to tell them about Colin , but Hermione interrupted . 
" We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling 
Professor Flitwick this morning . 
That's why we decided we'd better get going — " " The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy , the better , " snarled Ron . 
" D ' you know what I think ? 
" Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night . " 
Ron and Hermione looked up , amazed . 
Harry told them everything Dobby had told him — or hadn't told him . 
Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open . 
" The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before ? " 
Hermione said . 
" This settles it , " said Ron in a triumphant voice . 
It's obvious . 
I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school . " 
" Maybe it can make itself invisible , " said Hermione , prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron . 
He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry . 
" So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm . . . 
He shook his head . 
" You know what , Harry ? 
If he doesn't stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you . " 
The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning . 
The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion . 
The first years were now moving around the castle in tight - knit groups , as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone . 
Meanwhile , hidden from the teachers , a roaring trade in talismans , amulets , and other protective devices was sweeping the school . 
Neville Longbottom bought a large , evil - smelling green onion , a pointed purple crystal , and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger ; he was a pureblood , and therefore unlikely to be attacked . 
In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual , collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas . 
The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him . 
Unfortunately , the potion was only half finished . 
They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin , and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores . 
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously . 
" I think I'd better do the actual stealing , " Hermione continued in a matter - of - fact tone . 
So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so . " 
Harry smiled feebly . 
Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye . 
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons . 
Snape prowled through the fumes , making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors ' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively . 
Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny , but he had his mind on more important things . 
He was waiting for Hermione's signal , and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion . 
When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville , Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded . 
Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron , pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket , and gave it a quick prod with his wand . 
The firework began to fizz and sputter . 
Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon ; Goyle blundered around , his hands over his eyes , which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened . 
Through the confusion , Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office . 
" Anyone who has been splashed , come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this — " Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward , his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon . 
As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk , some weighted down with arms like clubs , others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips , Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon , the front of her robes bulging . 
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided , Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework . 
There was a sudden hush . 
Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression . 
" He knew it was me , " Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
" I could tell . " 
Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly . 
" Snape can't prove it was you , " said Ron reassuringly to Harry . 
A week later , Harry , Ron , and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board , reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up . 
Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over , looking excited . 
" They're starting a Dueling Club ! " said Seamus . 
" Could be useful , " he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner . 
" Shall we go ? " 
Harry and Hermione were all for it , so at eight o ' clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall . 
The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it , all carrying their wands and looking excited . 
" Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young — maybe it ' ll be him . " 
Can everyone see me ? Can you all hear me ? 
Excellent ! 
" Now , Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club , to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions — for full details , see my published works . 
" Let me introduce my assistant , Professor Snape , " said Lockhart , flashing a wide smile . 
" He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin . 
Snape's upper lip was curling . 
Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed ; at least , Lockhart did , with much twirling of his hands , whereas Snape jerked his head irritably . 
Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them . 
" On the count of three , we will cast our first spells . 
Neither of us will be aiming to kill , of course . " 
" One — two — three — " Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent ; Snape cried : " Expelliarmus ! " 
There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet : He flew backward off the stage , smashed into the wall , and slid down it to sprawl on the floor . 
Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered . 
" Do you think he's all right ? " 
she squealed through her fingers . 
" Who cares ? " said Harry and Ron together . 
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet . 
His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end . 
" Well , there you have it ! " 
he said , tottering back onto the platform . 
" That was a Disarming Charm — as you see , I ' ve lost my wand — ah , thank you , Miss Brown — yes , an excellent idea to show them that , Professor Snape , but if you don't mind my saying so , it was very obvious what you were about to do . 
If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy — however , I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . 
Possibly Lockhart had noticed , because he said , " Enough demonstrating ! 
I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs . 
Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch - Fletchley , but Snape reached Harry and Ron first . 
Potter — " Harry moved automatically toward Hermione . 
" I don't think so , " said Snape , smiling coldly . 
" Mr. 
Malfoy , come over here . 
Let's see what you make of the famous Potter . 
And you , Miss Granger — you can partner Miss Bulstrode . " 
Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return . 
called Lockhart , back on the platform . 
" And bow ! " Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads , not taking their eyes off each other . 
" Wands at the ready ! " shouted Lockhart . 
" When I count to three , cast your charms to disarm your opponents — only to disarm them — we don't want any accidents — one . . . 
two . . . 
three — " 
Harry swung his wand high , but Malfoy had already started on " two " : His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan . 
He stumbled , but everything still seemed to be working , and wasting no more time , Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted , " Rictusempra ! " 
Harry hung back , with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor , but this was a mistake ; gasping for breath , Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees , choked , " Tarantallegra ! " and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep . 
" Stop ! 
" Finite Incantatem ! " he shouted ; Harry's feet stopped dancing , Malfoy stopped laughing , and they were able to look up . 
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene . 
Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor , panting ; Ron was holding up an ashen - faced Seamus , apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done ; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving ; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain ; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor . 
It was difficult : She was a lot bigger than he was . 
" Dear , dear , " said Lockhart , skittering through the crowd , looking at the aftermath of the duels . 
" Up you go , Macmillan . . . . 
Pinch it hard , it ' ll stop bleeding in a second , Boot — " I think I'd better teach you how to block unfriendly spells , " said Lockhart , standing flustered in the midst of the hall . 
He glanced at Snape , whose black eyes glinted , and looked quickly away . 
Neville's round , pink face went pinker . 
" How about Malfoy and Potter ? " said Snape with a twisted smile . 
" Excellent idea ! " said Lockhart , gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room . 
" Now , Harry , " said Lockhart . 
" When Draco points his wand at you , you do this . " 
He raised his own wand , attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action , and dropped it . 
Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said , " Professor , could you show me that blocking thing again ? " 
" You wish , " said Harry out of the corner of his mouth . 
Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder . 
" Just do what I did , Harry ! " " What , drop my wand ? " 
" Three — two — one — go ! " he shouted . 
Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed , " Serpensortia ! " 
The end of his wand exploded . 
Harry watched , aghast , as a long black snake shot out of it , fell heavily onto the floor between them , and raised itself , ready to strike . 
There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away , clearing the floor . 
" I ' ll get rid of it . . . 
. " " Allow me ! " shouted Lockhart . 
He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang ; the snake , instead of vanishing , flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack . 
All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake , " Leave him alone ! " 
And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor , docile as a thick , black garden hose , its eyes now on Harry . 
Harry felt the fear drain out of him . 
He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now , though how he knew it , he couldn't have explained . 
He looked up at Justin , grinning , expecting to see Justin looking relieved , or puzzled , or even grateful — but certainly not angry and scared . 
" What do you think you ' re playing at ? " he shouted , and before Harry could say anything , Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall . 
Snape stepped forward , waved his wand , and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke . 
Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes . 
" Come on , " said Ron's voice in his ear . 
As they went through the doors , the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something . 
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on , and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room . 
Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said , " You ' re a Parselmouth . 
Why didn't you tell us ? " " I'm a what ? " said Harry . 
" A Parselmouth ! " said Ron . " You can talk to snakes ! " " I know , " said Harry . 
" I mean , that's only the second time I ' ve ever done it . 
I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — that was before I knew I was a wizard — " " A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil ? " Ron repeated faintly . 
" So ? " said Harry . 
" I bet loads of people here can do it . " 
Harry , this is bad . " 
" What's bad ? " said Harry , starting to feel quite angry . 
" What's wrong with everyone ? 
Listen , if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin — " " Oh , that's what you said to it ? " 
" What d ' you mean ? 
You were there — you heard me — " " I heard you speaking Parseltongue , " said Ron . " Snake language . 
" I spoke a different language ? 
But — I didn't realize — how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it ? " 
Ron shook his head . 
" D ' you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head ? " he said . 
" What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt ? " " It matters , " said Hermione , speaking at last in a hushed voice , " because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for . 
That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent . " 
Harry's mouth fell open . 
" You ' ll find that hard to prove , " said Hermione . 
Harry lay awake for hours that night . 
Through a gap in the curtains around his four - poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered . . . 
Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin ? 
He didn't know anything about his father's family , after all . 
It seemed he had to be face - to - face with a snake to do it . 
But I'm in Gryffindor , Harry thought . 
The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood . . . . 
Harry turned over . 
By next morning , however , the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled : Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes , a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else , now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs . Norris and Colin Creevey . 
Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room , while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess . 
" For heaven's sake , Harry , " said Hermione , exasperated , as one of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board . 
" Go and find Justin if it's so important to you . " 
So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole , wondering where Justin might be . 
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick , swirling gray snow at every window . 
Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who , by the sound of it , had turned his friend into a badger . 
Resisting the urge to take a look , Harry walked on by , thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work , and deciding to check the library first . 
A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library , but they didn't seem to be working . 
" So anyway , " a stout boy was saying , " I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory . 
I mean to say , if Potter's marked him down as his next victim , it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while . 
Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton . 
That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's heir on the loose , is it ? " 
" Hannah , " said the stout boy solemnly , " he's a Parselmouth . 
Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard . 
Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes ? 
Enemies of the Heir , Beware . 
Next thing we know , Filch's cat's attacked . 
That first year , Creevey , was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match , taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud . 
I mean to say , he was only a baby when it happened . 
Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him . 
Harry couldn't take anymore . 
Clearing his throat loudly , he stepped out from behind the bookshelves . 
If he hadn't been feeling so angry , he would have found the sight that greeted him funny : Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him , and the color was draining out of Ernie's face . 
" Hello , " said Harry . 
" I'm looking for Justin Finch - Fletchley . " 
The Hufflepuffs ' worst fears had clearly been confirmed . 
They all looked fearfully at Ernie . 
" What do you want with him ? " said Ernie in a quavering voice . 
" I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club , " said Harry . 
Ernie bit his white lips and then , taking a deep breath , said , " We were all there . 
Harry said , his voice shaking with anger . 
" And in case you ' re getting ideas , " he added hastily , " I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's , so — " " I don't care what sort of blood you ' ve got ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" Why would I want to attack Muggle - borns ? " 
" I ' ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with , " said Ernie swiftly . 
" It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them , " said Harry . 
" I'd like to see you try it . " 
He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library , earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince , who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook . 
Harry blundered up the corridor , barely noticing where he was going , he was in such a fury . 
" Oh , hello , Hagrid , " Harry said , looking up . 
" What ' re you doing in here ? " 
" It's nothing , " he said . 
" I'd better get going , Hagrid , it's Transfiguration next and I ' ve got to pick up my books . " 
Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor , which was particularly dark ; the torches had been extinguished by a strong , icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane . 
He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor . 
He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved . 
Justin Finch - Fletchley was lying on the floor , rigid and cold , a look of shock frozen on his face , his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling . 
And that wasn't all . 
Next to him was another figure , the strangest sight Harry had ever seen . 
Harry got to his feet , his breathing fast and shallow , his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs . 
He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies . 
The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side . 
He had to get help . . . . 
" What's Potter up to ? 
Why's Potter lurking — " 
For several long minutes , there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick . 
Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet . 
Professor McGonagall came running , followed by her own class , one of whom still had black - and - white - striped hair . 
No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived , panting , on the scene . 
" Caught in the act ! " 
Ernie yelled , his face stark white , pointing his finger dramatically at Harry . 
" That will do , Macmillan ! " said Professor McGonagall sharply . 
Peeves was bobbing overhead , now grinning wickedly , surveying the scene ; Peeves always loved chaos . 
As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick , examining them , Peeves broke into song : 
" Oh , Potter , you rotter , oh , what have you done , You ' re killing off students , you think it's good fun — " 
Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department , but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick . 
In the end , Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air , which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs . 
This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together . 
" Professor , " said Harry at once , " I swear I didn't — " " This is out of my hands , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall curtly . 
" Lemon drop ! " she said . 
This was evidently a password , because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two . 
Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward , like an escalator . 
As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it , Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them . 
They rose upward in circles , higher and higher , until at last , slightly dizzy , Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead , with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin . 
He knew now where he was being taken . 
This must be where Dumbledore lived . 
They stepped off the stone staircase at the top , and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door . 
Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there , alone . 
Harry looked around . 
One thing was certain : of all the teachers ' offices Harry had visited so far this year , Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting . 
If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school , he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it . 
It was a large and beautiful circular room , full of funny little noises . 
There was also an enormous , claw - footed desk , and , sitting on a shelf behind it , a shabby , tattered wizard's hat — the Sorting Hat . 
Harry hesitated . 
He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls . 
Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again ? 
Just to see . . . 
just to make sure it had put him in the right House — He walked quietly around the desk , lifted the hat from its shelf , and lowered it slowly onto his head . 
Harry stared at the black inside of the hat , waiting . 
Then a small voice said in his ear , " Bee in your bonnet , Harry Potter ? " " Er , yes , " Harry muttered . 
" Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask — " " You ' ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House , " said the hat smartly . 
" Yes . . . 
But I stand by what I said before " — Harry's heart leapt — " you would have done well in Slytherin — " Harry's stomach plummeted . 
He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off . 
" You ' re wrong , " he said aloud to the still and silent hat . 
Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit - looking bird that resembled a half - plucked turkey . 
Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back , making its gagging noise again . 
Harry thought it looked very ill . 
Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it , when the bird burst into flames . 
Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk . 
He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one ; the bird , meanwhile , had become a fireball ; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor . 
The office door opened . 
Dumbledore came in , looking very somber . 
" Professor , " Harry gasped . 
" About time , too , " he said . 
He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face . 
" Fawkes is a phoenix , Harry . 
Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes . 
Watch him . . 
Harry looked down in time to see a tiny , wrinkled , newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes . 
It was quite as ugly as the old one . 
They can carry immensely heavy loads , their tears have healing powers , and they make highly faithful pets . " 
In the shock of Fawkes catching fire , Harry had forgotten what he was there for , but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating , light - blue stare . 
Before Dumbledore could speak another word , however , the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in , a wild look in his eyes , his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand . 
" It wasn ' Harry , Professor Dumbledore ! " said Hagrid urgently . 
" I was talkin'ter him seconds before that kid was found , he never had time , sir — " Dumbledore tried to say something , but Hagrid went ranting on , waving the rooster around in his agitation , sending feathers everywhere . 
" — it can't ' ve bin him , I ' ll swear it in front o ' the Ministry o ' Magic if I have to — " " Hagrid , I — " " — yeh ' ve got the wrong boy , sir , I know Harry never — " " Hagrid ! " said Dumbledore loudly . 
" I do not think that Harry attacked those people . " 
" Right . 
I ' ll wait outside then , Headmaster . " 
And he stomped out looking embarrassed . 
" You don't think it was me , Professor ? " 
Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk . 
" But I still want to talk to you . " 
Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him , the tips of his long fingers together . 
" I must ask you , Harry , whether there is anything you'd like to tell me , " he said gently . 
" Anything at all . " 
Harry didn't know what to say . 
He thought of Malfoy shouting , " You ' ll be next , Mudbloods ! " and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said : " Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign , even in the wizarding world . " 
" No , " said Harry . 
What could possibly do that to a ghost ? 
There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas . 
" At this rate , we ' ll be the only ones left , " Ron told Harry and Hermione . 
" Us , Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle . 
But Harry was glad that most people were leaving . 
He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors , as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison ; tired of all the muttering , pointing , and hissing as he passed . 
Fred and George , however , found all this very funny . 
They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors , shouting , " Make way for the Heir of Slytherin , seriously evil wizard coming through . . . 
" It is not a laughing matter , " he said coldly . 
" Oh , get out of the way , Percy , " said Fred . " Harry's in a hurry . " 
" Yeah , he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant , " said George , chortling . 
" Oh , don't , " she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next , or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met . 
Harry didn't mind ; it made him feel better that Fred and George , at least , thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous . 
" It's because he's bursting to say it's really him , " said Ron knowingly . 
" Not for long , " said Hermione in a satisfied tone . 
At last the term ended , and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle . 
Harry found it peaceful , rather than gloomy , and enjoyed the fact that he , Hermione , and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower , which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone , and practice dueling in private . 
Fred , George , and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs . Weasley . 
Percy , who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior , didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room . 
He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time . 
Christmas morning dawned , cold and white . 
Harry and Ron , the only ones left in their dormitory , were woken very early by Hermione , who burst in , fully dressed and carrying presents for them both . 
" Wake up , " she said loudly , pulling back the curtains at the window . 
" Merry Christmas to you , too , " said Hermione , throwing him his present . 
" I ' ve been up for nearly an hour , adding more lacewings to the potion . 
It's ready . " 
Harry sat up , suddenly wide awake . 
" Are you sure ? " " Positive , " said Hermione , shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four - poster . 
" If we ' re going to do it , I say it should be tonight . " 
At that moment , Hedwig swooped into the room , carrying a very small package in her beak . 
" Hello , " said Harry happily as she landed on his bed . 
" Are you speaking to me again ? " 
They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation , too . 
Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee , which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating ; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons , a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team , and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle - feather quill . 
Harry opened the last present to find a new , hand - knitted sweater from Mrs . Weasley and a large plum cake . 
He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt , thinking about Mr. Weasley's car ( which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow ) , and the bout of rule - breaking he and Ron were planning next . 
The Great Hall looked magnificent . 
Not only were there a dozen frost - covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling , but enchanted snow was falling , warm and dry , from the ceiling . 
Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening . 
" We still need a bit of the people you ' re changing into , " said Hermione matter - of - factly , as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent . 
" I ' ve got it all worked out , " she went on smoothly , ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces . 
She held up two plump chocolate cakes . 
All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them . 
Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other . 
" The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair , " she said sternly . 
" You do want to investigate Malfoy , don't you ? " " Oh , all right , all right , " said Harry . 
" But what about you ? 
Whose hair are you ripping out ? " 
" Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club ? 
And she's gone home for Christmas — so I ' ll just have to tell the Slytherins I ' ve decided to come back . " 
When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again , Ron turned to Harry with a doom - laden expression . 
" Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong ? " 
But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement , stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said . 
They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea , waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table , shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle . 
Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters . 
When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall , Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door . 
For a moment , both of them chewed greedily , looks of triumph on their faces . 
Then , without the smallest change of expression , they both keeled over backward onto the floor . 
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall . 
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops , Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore - 
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron . 
Pulling their robes up over their faces , Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door . 
" Hermione ? " 
They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged , shiny - faced and looking anxious . 
Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling , glutinous potion . 
Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat . 
" Did you get them ? " 
Hermione asked breathlessly . 
Harry showed her Goyle's hair . 
" Good . 
" You ' ll need bigger sizes once you ' re Crabbe and Goyle . " 
The three of them stared into the cauldron . 
" I'm sure I ' ve done everything right , " said Hermione , nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions . 
" It looks like the book says it should . . . 
" Now what ? " Ron whispered . 
" We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs . " 
Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses . 
Then , her hand trembling , she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass . 
The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly . 
A second later , it had turned a sick sort of yellow . 
" Add yours , then , " said Hermione . 
Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one . 
Both glasses hissed and frothed : Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger , Crabbe's a dark , murky brown . 
" Hang on , " said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses . 
" Good thinking , " said Ron , unlocking the door . 
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion , Harry slipped into the middle stall . 
" Ready ? " he called . 
" Ready , " came Ron's and Hermione's voices . 
Immediately , his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes — doubled up , he wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes — next , bringing him gasping to all fours , came a horrible melting feeling , as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax — and before his eyes , his hands began to grow , the fingers thickened , the nails broadened , the knuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small — As suddenly as it had started , everything stopped . 
Harry lay facedown on the stone - cold floor , listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet . 
With difficulty , he kicked off his shoes and stood up . 
So this was what it felt like , being Goyle . 
His large hand trembling , he pulled off his old robes , which were hanging a foot above his ankles , pulled on the spare ones , and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes . 
He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles , low on his forehead . 
Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them — he took them off and called , " Are you two okay ? " 
Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth . 
Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror . 
Harry scratched his ear . 
Ron's door opened . 
They stared at each other . 
Except that he looked pale and shocked , Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe , from the pudding - bowl haircut to the long , gorilla arms . 
" This is unbelievable , " said Ron , approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose . 
" Unbelievable . " 
" We'd better get going , " said Harry , loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist . 
" We ' ve still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is . 
I only hope we can find someone to follow . . 
He banged on Hermione's door . 
" I — I don't think I'm going to come after all . 
You go on without me . " 
" Hermione , we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly , no one's going to know it's you — " " No — really — I don't think I ' ll come . 
You two hurry up , you ' re wasting time — " Harry looked at Ron , bewildered . 
" Hermione , are you okay ? " said Harry through the door . 
" Fine — I'm fine — go on — " Harry looked at his watch . 
Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully , checked that the coast was clear , and set off . " Don't swing your arms like that , " Harry muttered to Ron . " Eh ? " " Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . 
. " " How's this ? " " Yeah , that's better . . . 
They went down the marble staircase . 
All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room , but there was nobody around . 
" Any ideas ? " muttered Harry . 
" The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there , " said Ron , nodding at the entrance to the dungeons . 
The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long , curly hair emerged from the entrance . 
" Our common room ? 
I'm a Ravenclaw . " 
She walked away , looking suspiciously back at them . 
Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness , their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor , feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped . 
" Ha ! " said Ron excitedly . 
" There's one of them now ! " 
It wasn't a Slytherin , it was Percy . 
" What ' re you doing down here ? " said Ron in surprise . 
Percy looked affronted . 
It's Crabbe , isn't it ? " 
" Wh — oh , yeah , " said Ron . " Well , get off to your dormitories , " said Percy sternly . 
" It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days . " 
" I , " said Percy , drawing himself up , " am a prefect . 
Nothing's about to attack me . " 
A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron . 
Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them , and for the first time in his life , Harry was pleased to see him . 
" Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time ? 
I ' ve been looking for you ; I want to show you something really funny . " 
Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy . 
" And what ' re you doing down here , Weasley ? " he sneered . 
Percy looked outraged . 
" You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect ! " he said . 
" I don't like your attitude ! " 
Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him . 
Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time . 
He and Ron hurried after Malfoy , who said as they turned into the next passage , " That Peter Weasley — " " Percy , " Ron corrected him automatically . 
" Whatever , " said Malfoy . 
And I bet I know what he's up to . 
He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single - handed . " 
He gave a short , derisive laugh . 
Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks . 
Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare , damp stone wall . 
" What's the new password again ? " he said to Harry . 
" Er — " said Harry . 
" Oh , yeah — pure - blood ! " said Malfoy , not listening , and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open . 
Malfoy marched through it , and Harry and Ron followed him . 
The Slytherin common room was a long , low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round , greenish lamps were hanging on chains . 
" Wait here , " said Malfoy to Harry and Ron , motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire . 
" I ' ll go and get it — my father's just sent it to me — " Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them , Harry and Ron sat down , doing their best to look at home . 
Malfoy came back a minute later , holding what looked like a newspaper clipping . 
Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock . 
He read the clipping quickly , gave a very forced laugh , and handed it to Harry . 
INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Arthur Weasley , Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office , was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car . 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy , a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year , called today for Mr. Weasley's resignation . 
" Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute , " Mr. Malfoy told our reporter . 
" He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately . " 
" Don't you think it's funny ? " 
" Ha , ha , " said Harry bleakly . 
" Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them , " said Malfoy scornfully . 
" You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods , the way they behave . " 
Ron's — or rather , Crabbe's — face was contorted with fury . 
" What's up with you , Crabbe ? " snapped Malfoy . 
" Stomachache , " Ron grunted . 
" You know , I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet , " he went on thoughtfully . 
" I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up . 
Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place . 
Can I have your autograph ? 
Can I lick your shoes , please , Potter ? ' " 
He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron . 
" What's the matter with you two ? " Far too late , Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh , but Malfoy seemed satisfied ; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake . 
" Saint Potter , the Mudbloods ' friend , " said Malfoy slowly . 
And people think he's Slytherin's heir ! " 
" I could help them . " 
Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual . 
. " " You know I haven't , Goyle , how many times do I have to tell you ? " snapped Malfoy . 
" And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either . 
Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it ' ll look suspicious if I know too much about it . 
But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened , a Mudblood died . 
So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time . . . . 
Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy , Harry shot him a warning look and said , " D ' you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught ? " " Oh , yeah . . . 
whoever it was was expelled , " said Malfoy . 
" They're probably still in Azkaban . " 
" Azkaban ? " said Harry , puzzled . 
" Azkaban — the wizard prison , Goyle , " said Malfoy , looking at him in disbelief . 
He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth , but not to get mixed up in it . 
You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week ? " 
Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern . 
" Yeah . . 
. " said Malfoy . 
So did Harry . 
Ron blushed . 
Even his hair was turning red . 
" Medicine for my stomach , " Ron grunted , and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room , hurled themselves at the stone wall , and dashed up the passage , hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything . 
Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank ; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall , which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle . 
Leaving their shoes outside the closet door , they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
" I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks , but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys'drawing room . " 
Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror . 
He was back to normal . 
He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's stall . 
" Hermione , come out , we ' ve got loads to tell you — " " Go away ! " Hermione squeaked . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other . 
Harry had never seen her looking so happy . 
" It's awful — " They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged , sobbing , her robes pulled up over her head . 
" What's up ? " said Ron uncertainly . 
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink . 
Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long , pointed ears poking through her hair . 
" It's okay , Hermione , " said Harry quickly . 
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom . 
Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks . 
There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays , because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked . 
So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione's bed , to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face . 
Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening . 
When the new term started , they brought her each day's homework . 
Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown . 
" I don't suppose you ' ve got any new leads ? " 
" Nothing , " said Harry gloomily . 
" I was so sure it was Malfoy , " said Ron , for about the hundredth time . 
" What's that ? " asked Harry , pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow . 
Ron looked up at Hermione , disgusted . 
" Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you ' ve ever met , or what ? " Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower . 
Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears . 
" That's Filch , " Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused , out of sight , listening hard . 
" You don't think someone else's been attacked ? " said Ron tensely . 
They stood still , their heads inclined toward Filch's voice , which sounded quite hysterical . 
" — even more work for me ! 
They poked their heads around the corner . 
Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post : They were once again on the spot where Mrs . Norris had been attacked . 
They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about . 
A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor , and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
" Now what's up with her ? " said Ron . " Let's go and see , " said Harry , and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign , ignored it as always , and entered . 
It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet . 
" What's up , Myrtle ? " said Harry . 
" Who's that ? " glugged Myrtle miserably . 
. " " But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you , " said Harry , reasonably . 
" I mean , it'd just go right through you , wouldn't it ? " 
He had said the wrong thing . 
Well , ha , ha , ha ! 
asked Harry . 
" I don't know . . . . 
I was just sitting in the U - bend , thinking about death , and it fell right through the top of my head , " said Myrtle , glaring at them . 
Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing . 
A small , thin book lay there . 
It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom . 
Harry stepped forward to pick it up , but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" Are you crazy ? " said Ron . " It could be dangerous . " 
" Dangerous ? " said Harry , laughing . 
" Come off it , how could it be dangerous ? " 
" Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated — Dad's told me — there was one that burned your eyes out . 
And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading ! 
You just had to wander around with your nose in it , trying to do everything one - handed . 
And — " " All right , I ' ve got the point , " said Harry . 
The little book lay on the floor , nondescript and soggy . 
Harry saw at once that it was a diary , and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old . 
He opened it eagerly . 
On the first page he could just make out the name " T . 
M . Riddle " in smudged ink . 
" Hang on , " said Ron , who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder . 
" I know that name . . . . 
T . M . Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . " 
" How on earth d ' you know that ? " said Harry in amazement . 
Harry peeled the wet pages apart . 
There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them , not even Auntie Mabel's birthday , or dentist , half - past three . 
" He never wrote in it , " said Harry , disappointed . 
" I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away ? " said Ron curiously . 
Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road , London . 
" He must ' ve been Muggle - born , " said Harry thoughtfully . 
" To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road . . . 
. " " Well , it's not much use to you , " said Ron . 
He dropped his voice . 
Harry , however , pocketed it . 
Hermione left the hospital wing , de - whiskered , tail - less , and furfree , at the beginning of February . 
On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower , Harry showed her T . M . Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it . 
" If it has , it's hiding them very well , " said Ron . " Maybe it's shy . 
" I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it , " said Harry . 
" Could ' ve been anything , " said Ron . " Maybe he got thirty O . W . L . s or saved a teacher from the giant squid . 
But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking . 
" What ? " said Ron , looking from one to the other . 
" Well , the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago , wasn't it ? " he said . 
" That's what Malfoy said . " 
" Yeah . . 
. " said Ron slowly . 
" And this diary is fifty years old , " said Hermione , tapping it excitedly . 
" So ? " " Oh , Ron , wake up , " snapped Hermione . 
" We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago . 
We know T . M . Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . 
But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag . 
" It might be invisible ink ! " she whispered . 
She tapped the diary three times and said , " Aparecium ! " 
Nothing happened . 
Undaunted , Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser . 
She rubbed hard on January first . 
Nothing happened . 
" I'm telling you , there's nothing to find in there , " said Ron . " Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in . " 
Harry couldn't explain , even to himself , why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away . 
The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank , he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages , as though it were a story he wanted to finish . 
And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T . M . Riddle before , it still seemed to mean something to him , almost as though 
Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small , and had halfforgotten . 
But this was absurd . 
Nevertheless , Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle , so next day at break , he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award , accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron , who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime . 
Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet . 
probably top of every class — " " You say that like it's a bad thing , " said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice . 
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again . 
Inside the castle , the mood had grown more hopeful . 
There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick , and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive , meaning that they were fast leaving childhood . 
You ' ll have Mrs . 
It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets , with the school so alert and suspicious . 
Perhaps the monster , whatever it was , was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years . . . . 
He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one , that he had " given himself away " at the Dueling Club . 
Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop . 
Wash away the memories of last term ! 
I won't say any more just now , but I think I know just the thing . . . 
He tapped his nose again and strode off . 
Lockhart's idea of a morale - booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth . 
Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late - running Quidditch practice the night before , and he hurried down to the Great Hall , slightly late . 
The walls were all covered with large , lurid pink flowers . 
Worse still , heart - shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling . 
Harry went over to the Gryffindor table , where Ron was sitting looking sickened , and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles . 
" What's going on ? " 
Harry asked them , sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon . 
Ron pointed to the teachers ' table , apparently too disgusted to speak . 
The teachers on either side of him were looking stony - faced . 
From where he sat , Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek . 
" Happy Valentine's Day ! " Lockhart shouted . 
" And may I thank the forty - six people who have so far sent me cards ! 
Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly - looking dwarfs . 
I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion ! 
Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion ! 
And while you ' re at it , Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I ' ve ever met , the sly old dog ! " Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands . 
" Please , Hermione , tell me you weren't one of the forty - six , " said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson . 
All day long , the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines , to the annoyance of the teachers , and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms , one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry . 
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years , which happened to include Ginny Weasley , Harry tried to escape . 
" Let me go ! " Harry snarled , tugging . 
His books , wand , parchment , and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything . 
Harry scrambled around , trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing , causing something of a holdup in the corridor . 
" What's going on here ? " 
came the cold , drawling voice of Draco Malfoy . 
Losing his head , Harry tried to make a run for it , but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor . 
" Right , " he said , sitting on Harry's ankles . 
" Here is your singing valentine : 
His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad , His hair is as dark as a blackboard . 
Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot . 
Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else , he got up , his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf , as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd , some of whom were crying with mirth . 
" Off you go , off you go , the bell rang five minutes ago , off to class , now , " he said , shooing some of the younger students away . 
" And you , Malfoy — " Harry , glancing over , saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something . 
" Give that back , " said Harry quietly . 
ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary . 
" Hand it over , Malfoy , " said Percy sternly . 
" When I ' ve had a look , " said Malfoy , waving the diary tauntingly at Harry . 
He pulled out his wand and shouted , " Expelliarmus ! " and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart , so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air . 
" Harry ! " said Percy loudly . 
" No magic in the corridors . 
I ' ll have to report this , you know ! " 
Malfoy was looking furious , and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom , he yelled spitefully after her , " I don't think Potter liked your valentine much ! " Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class . 
Snarling , Ron pulled out his wand , too , but Harry pulled him away . 
The diary , however , was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it . 
He tried to point this out to Ron , but Ron was having trouble with his wand again ; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end , and he wasn't much interested in anything else . 
Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night . 
This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing , " His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad " one more time , and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again , and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time . 
Harry sat on his four - poster and flicked through the blank pages , not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it . 
Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet , dipped his quill into it , and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary . 
The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then , as though it was being sucked into the page , vanished . 
Excited , Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote , " My name is Harry Potter . " 
Oozing back out of the page , in his very own ink , came words Harry had never written . 
" Hello , Harry Potter . 
My name is Tom Riddle . 
How did you come by my diary ? " 
" Someone tried to flush it down a toilet . " 
He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply . 
But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read . " 
" What do you mean ? " 
Harry scrawled , blotting the page in his excitement . 
" I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things . 
Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . " 
" I'm at Hogwarts , and horrible stuff's been happening . 
Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets ? " His heart was hammering . 
Riddle's reply came quickly , his writing becoming untidier , as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew . 
" Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets . 
In my day , they told us it was a legend , that it did not exist . 
But this was a lie . 
In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one . 
I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled . 
But the headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth . 
They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut . 
But I knew it could happen again . 
The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned . " 
Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back . 
" It's happening again now . 
There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them . 
Who was it last time ? " 
" I can show you , if you like , " came Riddle's reply . 
I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him . " 
Harry hesitated , his quill suspended over the diary . 
What did Riddle mean ? 
He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory , which was growing dark . 
When he looked back at the diary , he saw fresh words forming . 
" Let me show you . " 
Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters . 
" OK . " 
The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind , stopping halfway through the month of June . 
His hands trembling slightly , he raised the book to press his eye against the little window , and before he knew what was happening , he was tilting forward ; the window was widening , he felt his body leave his bed , and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page , into a whirl of color and shadow . 
He knew immediately where he was . 
This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office — but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk . 
A wizened , fraillooking wizard , bald except for a few wisps of white hair , was reading a letter by candlelight . 
Harry had never seen this man before . 
" I'm sorry , " he said shakily . 
He continued to read , frowning slightly . 
" Sorry I disturbed you . 
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh , stood up , walked past Harry without glancing at him , and went to draw the curtains at his window . 
The sky outside the window was ruby - red ; it seemed to be sunset . 
The wizard went back to the desk , sat down , and twiddled his thumbs , watching the door . 
Harry looked around the office . 
This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it , meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster , not Dumbledore , and he , Harry , was little more than a phantom , completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago . 
There was a knock on the office door . 
" Enter , " said the old wizard in a feeble voice . 
He was much taller than Harry , but he , too , had jet - black hair . 
" Ah , Riddle , " said the headmaster . 
" You wanted to see me , Professor Dippet ? " said Riddle . 
He looked nervous . 
" Sit down , " said Dippet . 
" I ' ve just been reading the letter you sent me . " " Oh , " said Riddle . 
Surely you want to go home for the holidays ? " 
" No , " said Riddle at once . 
" I'd much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that — " 
" Yes , sir , " said Riddle , reddening slightly . 
" You are Muggle - born ? " 
" Half - blood , sir , " said Riddle . 
" Muggle father , witch mother . " 
Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically . 
" The thing is , Tom , " he sighed , " special arrangements might have been made for you , but in the current circumstances . . . 
" Precisely , " said the headmaster . 
" My dear boy , you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends . 
Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little girl . . . . 
As a matter of fact , the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school . 
Riddle's eyes had widened . 
" Riddle , do you mean you know something about these attacks ? " " No , sir , " said Riddle quickly . 
But Harry was sure it was the same sort of " no " that he himself had given Dumbledore . 
" You may go , Tom . . . 
Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room . 
Harry followed him . 
Down the moving spiral staircase they went , emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor . 
Riddle stopped , and so did Harry , watching him . 
Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking . 
He was biting his lip , his forehead furrowed . 
They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall , when a tall wizard with long , sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase . 
" What are you doing , wandering around this late , Tom ? " Harry gaped at the wizard . 
He was none other than a fifty - yearyounger Dumbledore . 
" I had to see the headmaster , sir , " said Riddle . 
" Well , hurry off to bed , " said Dumbledore , giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well . 
" Best not to roam the corridors these days . 
Not since . . 
He sighed heavily , bade Riddle good night , and strode off . 
Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then , moving quickly , headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons , with Harry in hot pursuit . 
But to Harry's disappointment , Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape . 
The torches hadn't been lit , and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed , Harry could only just see him , standing stock - still by the door , watching the passage outside . 
It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour . 
All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door , staring through the crack , waiting like a statue . 
And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present , he heard something move beyond the door . 
Someone was creeping along the passage . 
Riddle , quiet as a shadow , edged through the door and followed , Harry tiptoeing behind him , forgetting that he couldn't be heard . 
For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps , until Riddle stopped suddenly , his head inclined in the direction of new noises . 
Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner . 
Harry stepped out behind him . 
He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door , a very large box next to it . 
" ' Evening , Rubeus , " said Riddle sharply . 
The boy slammed the door shut and stood up . 
" It's all over , " he said . 
" I'm going to have to turn you in , Rubeus . 
But monsters don't make good pets . 
" Come on , Rubeus , " said Riddle , moving yet closer . 
" The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow . 
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered . . . 
roared the boy , his voice echoing in the dark passage . 
" He wouldn ' ! 
He never ! " " Stand aside , " said Riddle , drawing out his wand . 
The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite . 
And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long , piercing scream unheard by anyone — A vast , low - slung , hairy body and a tangle of black legs ; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor - sharp pincers — Riddle raised his wand again , but he was too late . 
The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away , tearing up the corridor and out of sight . 
Riddle scrambled to his feet , looking after it ; he raised his wand , but the huge boy leapt on him , seized his wand , and threw him back down , yelling , " NOOOOOOO ! " 
The scene whirled , the darkness became complete ; Harry felt himself falling and , with a crash , he landed spread - eagled on his four - poster in the Gryffindor dormitory , Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach . 
Before he had had time to regain his breath , the dormitory door opened and Ron came in . 
" There you are , " he said . 
Harry sat up . 
He was sweating and shaking . 
" What's up ? " said Ron , looking at him with concern . 
" It was Hagrid , Ron . 
Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago . " 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN : CORNELIUS FUDGE 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures . 
During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house , and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant , three - headed dog he'd christened " Fluffy . " 
And if , as a boy , Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle , Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it . 
He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long , and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs ; Harry could just imagine the thirteen - year - old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it . 
Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary . 
Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he'd seen , until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long , circular conversations that followed . 
" Riddle might have got the wrong person , " said Hermione . 
" Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . 
Ron asked dully . 
Ron tried a different tack . 
" And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts , " said Harry . 
" I don't blame him for wanting to stay here . . . 
. " " You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley , didn't you , Harry ? " " He was buying a Flesh - Eating Slug Repellent , " said Harry quickly . 
The three of them fell silent . 
After a long pause , Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice . 
" Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all ? " 
Tell us , have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately ? ' " 
In the end , they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack , and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice , they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled . 
Peeves had finally got bored of his " Oh , Potter , you rotter " song , Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day , and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three . 
This made Professor Sprout very happy . 
The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year , a matter that Hermione , at least , took very seriously . 
" I just want to give up Potions , " said Harry . 
" We can't , " said Ron gloomily . 
Dean Thomas , who , like Harry , had grown up with Muggles , ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list , then picking the subjects it landed on . 
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them . 
" Depends where you want to go , Harry , " he said . 
People say Muggle Studies is a soft option , but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non - magical community , particularly if they ' re thinking of working in close contact with them — look at my father , he has to deal with Muggle business all the time . 
My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type , so he went for Care of Magical Creatures . 
Play to your strengths , Harry . " 
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch . 
In the end , he chose the same new subjects as Ron , feeling that if he was lousy at them , at least he'd have someone friendly to help him . 
Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff . 
Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner , so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework . 
However , the training sessions were getting better , or at least drier , and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better . 
At the top of the stairs to the dormitory , he met Neville Longbottom , who was looking frantic . 
" Harry — I don't know who did it — I just found — " Watching Harry fearfully , Neville pushed open the door . 
His cloak lay ripped on the floor . 
The bedclothes had been pulled off his four - poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet , the contents strewn over the mattress . 
Harry walked over to the bed , openmouthed , treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls . 
As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed , Ron , Dean , and Seamus came in . 
" What happened , Harry ? " " No idea , " said Harry . 
But Ron was examining Harry's robes . 
" Someone's been looking for something , " said Ron . " Is there anything missing ? " 
Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk . 
It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn't there . 
" Riddle's diary's gone , " he said in an undertone to Ron . " What ? " 
Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out . 
Hermione looked aghast at the news . 
" But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password — " " Exactly , " said Harry . 
" Perfect Quidditch conditions ! " said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table , loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs . 
Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table , wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes . 
Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery , but Harry didn't like the idea . 
He didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again . 
As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things , another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list . 
let me rip . . . 
tear . . 
He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm . 
" The voice ! " said Harry , looking over his shoulder . 
" I just heard it again — didn't you ? " 
Ron shook his head , wide - eyed . 
Hermione , however , clapped a hand to her forehead . 
" Harry — I think I ' ve just understood something ! 
I ' ve got to go to the library ! " 
And she sprinted away , up the stairs . 
" What does she understand ? " said Harry distractedly , still looking around , trying to tell where the voice had come from . 
" Loads more than I do , " said Ron , shaking his head . 
" But why's she got to go to the library ? " " Because that's what Hermione does , " said Ron , shrugging . 
" When in doubt , go to the library . " 
Harry stood , irresolute , trying to catch the voice again , but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him , talking loudly , exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch . 
" You'd better get moving , " said Ron . " It's nearly eleven — the match — " Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower , collected his Nimbus Two Thousand , and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds , but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice , and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room , his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game . 
Harry's heart dropped like a stone . 
" This match has been canceled , " Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone , addressing the packed stadium . 
" But , Professor ! " he shouted . 
" We ' ve got to play — the Cup — Gryffindor — " Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone : " All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms , where their Heads of Houses will give them further information . 
To Harry's surprise , Professor McGonagall didn't object . 
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled ; others looked worried . 
Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase . 
But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time . 
" This will be a bit of a shock , " said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary . 
another double attack . " 
Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered . 
Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth - year girl with long , curly hair . 
Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room . 
And on the bed next to her was — " Hermione ! " 
Ron groaned . 
" They were found near the library , " said Professor McGonagall . 
It was on the floor next to them . . . 
She was holding up a small , circular mirror . 
Harry and Ron shook their heads , both staring at Hermione . 
" I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower , " said Professor McGonagall heavily . 
" I need to address the students in any case . " 
" All students will return to their House common rooms by six o ' clock in the evening . 
No student is to leave the dormitories after that time . 
You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher . 
No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher . 
All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed . 
There will be no more evening activities . " 
The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence . 
It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught . 
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole , and the Gryffindors began talking immediately . 
" Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe ? 
The Heir of Slytherin , the monster of Slytherin — why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out ? " he roared , to nods and scattered applause . 
He was looking pale and stunned . 
" Percy's in shock , " George told Harry quietly . 
But Harry was only half - listening . 
He didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione , lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone . 
Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed . 
Harry now knew exactly how he had felt . 
" What ' re we going to do ? " said Ron quietly in Harry's ear . 
" We ' ve got to go and talk to him , " said Harry , making up his mind . 
Harry had inherited just one thing from his father : a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak . 
It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it . 
They went to bed at the usual time , waited until Neville , Dean , and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep , then got up , dressed again , and threw the cloak over themselves . 
Harry , who had wandered the castle at night several times before , had never seen it so crowded after sunset . 
They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door . 
" What ' re you two doin ' here ? " 
He nearly extinguished the fire , spilling water from the kettle on it , and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand . 
" Are you okay , Hagrid ? " said Harry . 
" Did you hear about Hermione ? " 
" Oh , I heard , all righ ' , " said Hagrid , a slight break in his voice . 
He poured them both large mugs of boiling water ( he had forgotten to add tea bags ) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door . 
Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks , then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner . 
Hagrid checked that they were hidden , seized his crossbow , and flung open his door once more . 
" Good evening , Hagrid . " 
It was Dumbledore . 
The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression , and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes : a pinstriped suit , a scarlet tie , a long black cloak , and pointed purple boots . 
" That's Dad's boss ! " Ron breathed . 
" Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic ! " 
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up . 
Had to come . 
" I never , " said Hagrid , looking imploringly at Dumbledore . 
" Hagrid's record's against him . 
Ministry's got to do something — the school governors have been in touch — " " Yet again , Cornelius , I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest , " said Dumbledore . 
His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before . 
" Look at it from my point of view , " said Fudge , fidgeting with his bowler . 
" I'm under a lot of pressure . 
Got to be seen to be doing something . 
But I ' ve got to take him . 
Got to . 
" Not a punishment , Hagrid , more a precaution . 
If someone else is caught , you ' ll be let out with a full apology — " 
" Not Azkaban ? " croaked Hagrid . 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut , swathed in a long black traveling cloak , smiling a cold and satisfied smile . 
" Already here , Fudge , " he said approvingly . 
" Good , good . . 
. " " What ' re you doin ' here ? " said Hagrid furiously . 
" I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here . " 
He spoke politely , but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes . 
How many attacks have there been now ? 
At this rate , there ' ll be no Muggle - borns left at Hogwarts , and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school . " 
" The appointment — or suspension — of the headmaster is a matter for the governors , Fudge , " said Mr. Malfoy smoothly . 
" But as all twelve of us have voted — " Hagrid leapt to his feet , his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling . 
" I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that . 
He looked at Lucius Malfoy . 
" If the governors want my removal , Lucius , I shall of course step aside — " " But — " stuttered Fudge . 
" No ! " growled Hagrid . 
Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones . 
" However , " said Dumbledore , speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word , " you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me . 
You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it . " 
For a second , Harry was almost sure Dumbledore's eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron stood hidden . 
" Admirable sentiments , " said Malfoy , bowing . 
He strode to the cabin door , opened it , and bowed Dumbledore out . 
That'd lead ' em right ! 
That's all I'm sayin ' . " 
But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door , he stopped again and said loudly , " An'someone ' ll need ter feed Fang while I'm away . " 
The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak . 
" No Dumbledore . 
They might as well close the school tonight . 
There ' ll be an attack a day with him gone . " 
Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle ; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses . 
But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows , striding the grounds with Fang at his heels , the scene didn't look right to Harry ; no better , in fact , than the inside of the castle , where things were so horribly wrong . 
Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione , but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing . 
With Dumbledore gone , fear had spread as never before , so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows . 
There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense , and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled . 
Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself . 
" I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me . . . . 
But what good were these words ? 
Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help , when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were ? 
Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand — the trouble was , there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow . 
They were hampered , of course , by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors . 
Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy . 
" I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever had . 
Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed . 
Snape swept past Harry , making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron . 
" Sir , " said Malfoy loudly . 
" Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors . 
" Yeah , right , " said Malfoy , smirking . 
" I don't care , I don't need my wand , I'm going to kill him with my bare hands — " " Hurry up , I ' ve got to take you all to Herbology , " barked Snape over the class's heads , and off they marched , with Harry , Ron , and Dean bringing up the rear , Ron still trying to get loose . 
It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses . 
The Herbology class was very subdued ; there were now two missing from their number , Justin and Hermione . 
Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs . 
Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face - to - face with Ernie Macmillan . 
Ernie took a deep breath and said , very formally , " I just want to say , Harry , that I'm sorry I ever suspected you . 
I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger , and I apologize for all the stuff I said . 
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron . 
" Do you think it's Malfoy , Harry ? " Ernie asked . 
" No , " said Harry , so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared . 
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass , moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting . 
Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears . 
What ' re you — " 
" Oh , yeah , " said Ron , trying , and failing , to look pleased . 
" But we can't follow them now — " Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously . 
Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders . 
" Looks like they ' re heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . 
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson . 
Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot . 
" We ' ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again , " Harry told Ron . " We can take Fang with us . 
He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid , he might be some help . " 
" Right , " said Ron , who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers . 
Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again . 
Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him . 
" My dear young man , the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty , " said Lockhart , in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two . 
" Oh , yes he would , " said Ron , even more loudly than Dean . 
Harry muttered . 
But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness , his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good , his confidence that the whole business was now at an end , irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face . 
Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron : Let's do it tonight . 
Ron read the message , swallowed hard , and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione . 
The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days , because from six o ' clock onward the Gryffindors had no where else to go . 
Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner , and spent the evening sitting on it , waiting for the room to clear . 
Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap , and Ginny sat watching them , very subdued in Hermione's usual chair . 
Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose , trying to finish the games quickly , but even so , it was well past midnight when Fred , George , and Ginny finally went to bed . 
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak , throwing it over themselves , and climbing through the portrait hole . 
It was another difficult journey through the castle , dodging all the teachers . 
At last they reached the entrance hall , slid back the lock on the oak front doors , squeezed between them , trying to stop any creaking , and stepped out into the moonlit grounds . 
" ' Course , " said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass , " we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow . 
When Harry pushed the door open , Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them . 
Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table . 
" C ' mon , Fang , we ' re going for a walk , " said Harry , patting his leg , and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them , dashed to the edge of the forest , and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree . 
Harry took out his wand , murmured , " Lumos ! " and a tiny light appeared at the end of it , just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders . 
" Good thinking , " said Ron . " I'd light mine , too , but you know — it'd probably blow up or something . . . 
Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder , pointing at the grass . 
Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees . 
" Okay , " Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst , " I'm ready . 
Let's go . " 
So , with Fang scampering around them , sniffing tree roots and leaves , they entered the forest . 
By the glow of Harry's wand , they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path . 
Then , when the trees had become thicker than ever , so that the stars overhead were no longer visible , and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark , they saw their spider guides leaving the path . 
Harry paused , trying to see where the spiders were going , but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch - black . 
He had never been this deep into the forest before . 
He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here . 
But Hagrid was miles away now , probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban , and he had also said to follow the spiders . 
Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward , crushing Ron's foot , but it was only Fang's nose . 
" What d ' you reckon ? " 
Harry said to Ron , whose eyes he could just make out , reflecting the light from his wand . 
" We ' ve come this far , " said Ron . 
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees . 
Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand . 
More than once , they had to stop , so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight . 
After a while , they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward , though the trees were as thick as ever . 
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great , echoing bark , making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins . 
" What ? " said Ron loudly , looking around into the pitch - dark , and gripping Harry's elbow very hard . 
" Listen . . . 
sounds like something big . . . 
They listened . 
Some distance to their right , the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees . 
" Oh , no , " said Ron . " Oh , no , oh , no , oh — " " Shut up , " said Harry frantically . 
" It ' ll hear you . " 
" Hear me ? " said Ron in an unnaturally high voice . 
" It's already heard Fang ! " 
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood , terrified , waiting . 
There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence . 
" What d ' you think it's doing ? " said Harry . 
" Probably getting ready to pounce , " said Ron . 
" D ' you think it's gone ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" Dunno — " Then , to their right , came a sudden blaze of light , so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes . 
" Harry ! " 
Ron shouted , his voice breaking with relief . 
" Harry , it's our car ! " " What ? " " Come on ! " 
Mr. Weasley's car was standing , empty , in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches , its headlights ablaze . 
" It's been here all the time ! " said Ron delightedly , walking around the car . 
" Look at it . 
The forest's turned it wild . . . 
The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud . 
His breathing slowing down again , Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes . 
" And we thought it was going to attack us ! " said Ron , leaning against the car and patting it . 
" I wondered where it had gone ! " 
Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders , but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights . 
" C ' mon , let's go and find them . " 
Ron didn't speak . 
Harry didn't even have time to turn around . 
There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground , so that he was hanging facedown . 
Struggling , terrified , he heard more clicking , and saw Ron's legs leave the ground , too , heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment , he was being swept away into the dark trees . 
They were moving into the very heart of the forest . 
Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster , whining loudly , but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to ; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing . 
He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches ; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf - strewn ground was now swarming with spiders . 
Craning his neck sideways , he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow , a hollow that had been cleared of trees , so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on . 
Spiders . 
The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty , domed web in the very center of the hollow , while its fellows closed in all around it , clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load . 
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him . 
Ron and Fang thudded down next to him . 
Ron looked exactly like Harry felt . 
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something . 
" Aragog ! " it called . 
" Aragog ! " 
And from the middle of the misty , domed web , a spider the size of a small elephant emerged , very slowly . 
There was gray in the black of his body and legs , and each of the eyes on his ugly , pincered head was milky white . 
He was blind . 
" What is it ? " 
he said , clicking his pincers rapidly . 
" Is it Hagrid ? " said Aragog , moving closer , his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely . 
" Kill them , " clicked Aragog fretfully . 
" I was sleeping . . . 
. " " We're friends of Hagrid's , " Harry shouted . 
His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat . 
Click , click , click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow . 
Aragog paused . 
" Hagrid's in trouble , " said Harry , breathing very fast . 
" That's why we ' ve come . " 
" In trouble ? " said the aged spider , and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers . 
" But why has he sent you ? " 
Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it ; he didn't think his legs would support him . 
So he spoke from the ground , as calmly as he could . 
Aragog clicked his pincers furiously , and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders ; it was like applause , except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear . 
" But that was years ago , " said Aragog fretfully . 
I remember it well . 
They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets . 
They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free . " 
" And you . . . 
" I ! " said Aragog , clicking angrily . 
" I was not born in the castle . 
A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg . 
Hagrid was only a boy , but he cared for me , hidden in a cupboard in the castle , feeding me on scraps from the table . 
Hagrid is my good friend , and a good man . 
When I was discovered , and blamed for the death of a girl , he protected me . 
I have lived here in the forest ever since , where Hagrid still visits me . 
" So you never — never attacked anyone ? " 
" Never , " croaked the old spider . 
The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom . 
I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up . 
Our kind like the dark and the quiet . . . 
. " " But then . . . 
Do you know what did kill that girl ? " said Harry . 
Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go , when I sensed the beast moving about the school . " 
" What is it ? " said Harry urgently . 
" We do not speak of it ! " said Aragog fiercely . 
" We do not name it ! 
I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature , though he asked me , many times . " 
Harry didn't want to press the subject , not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides . 
Aragog seemed to be tired of talking . 
" Go ? " said Aragog slowly . 
" I think not . . . 
Harry spun around . 
Even as he reached for his wand , Harry knew it was no good , there were too many of them , but as he tried to stand , ready to die fighting , a loud , long note sounded , and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow . 
The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open . 
" Get Fang ! " Harry yelled , diving into the front seat ; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him , yelping , into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut — Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him ; the engine roared and they were off , hitting more spiders . 
They sped up the slope , out of the hollow , and they were soon crashing through the forest , branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps , following a path it obviously knew . 
Harry looked sideways at Ron . 
His mouth was still open in the silent scream , but his eyes weren't popping anymore . 
" Are you okay ? " Ron stared straight ahead , unable to speak . 
They smashed their way through the undergrowth , Fang howling loudly in the back seat , and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak . 
After ten noisy , rocky minutes , the trees thinned , and Harry could again see patches of sky . 
They had reached the edge of the forest . 
Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out , and when Harry opened the door , he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house , tail between his legs . 
Harry got out too , and after a minute or so , Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed , still stiff - necked and staring . 
Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view . 
Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak . 
Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket . 
" Follow the spiders , " said Ron weakly , wiping his mouth on his sleeve . 
" I ' ll never forgive Hagrid . 
We're lucky to be alive . " 
" That's exactly Hagrid's problem ! " said Ron , thumping the wall of the cabin . 
A cell in Azkaban ! " 
" What was the point of sending us in there ? 
What have we found out , I'd like to know ? " " That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets , " said Harry , throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk . 
" He was innocent . " 
As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden , then pushed the creaking front doors ajar . 
They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase , holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking . 
At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room , where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash . 
They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory . 
Harry , however , didn't feel very sleepy . 
He sat on the edge of his fourposter , thinking hard about everything Aragog had said . 
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle , he thought , sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other monsters didn't want to name it . 
Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets . 
Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows , watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window . 
Riddle had caught the wrong person , the Heir of Slytherin had got off , and no one could tell whether it was the same person , or a different one , who had opened the Chamber this time . 
There was nobody else to ask . 
Harry lay down , still thinking about what Aragog had said . 
" Ron , " he hissed through the dark , " Ron — " Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's , stared wildly around , and saw Harry . 
Aragog said she was found in a bathroom , " said Harry , ignoring Neville's snuffling snores from the corner . 
What if she's still there ? " 
Ron rubbed his eyes , frowning through the moonlight . 
And then he understood , too . 
" You don't think — not Moaning Myrtle ? " 
All those times we were in that bathroom , and she was just three toilets away , " said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day , " and we could ' ve asked her , and now . . 
Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls ' bathroom , the girls ' bathroom , moreover , right next to the scene of the first attack , was going to be almost impossible . 
But something happened in their first lesson , Transfiguration , that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks . 
" We're still getting exams ? " 
There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped , vanishing one of the legs on his desk . 
Professor 
" The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education , " she said sternly . 
Studying hard ! 
" Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible , " she said . 
Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers . 
Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest . 
Three days before their first exam , Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast . 
" You ' ve caught the Heir of Slytherin ! " squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table . 
When the hubbub had subsided , Professor McGonagall said , " Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last . 
I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who , or what , attacked them . 
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in . 
Ron , however , was looking happier than he'd looked in days . 
" Hermione ' ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up ! 
Just then , Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron . 
She looked tense and nervous , and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap . 
" What's up ? " said Ron , helping himself to more porridge . 
" Spit it out , " said Ron , watching her . 
" What is it ? " said Harry . 
Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly , so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him . 
" Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets ? 
I'm starving , I ' ve only just come off patrol duty . " 
Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table . 
" Percy ! " said Ron angrily . 
" What sort of thing ? " he said , coughing . 
" How do you know ? " said Ron , his eyebrows raised . 
ted me doing something and I , um , I asked her not to mention it to anybody . 
I must say , I did think she'd keep her word . 
" What were you doing , Percy ? " said Ron , grinning . 
Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help , but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up — and to his delight it did , midmorning , when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Lockhart , who had so often assured them that all danger had passed , only to be proved wrong right away , was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors . 
His hair wasn't as sleek as usual ; it seemed he had been up most of the night , patrolling the fourth floor . 
" That's right , " said Ron , catching on . 
They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them , then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
Weasley ! 
What are you doing ? " 
It was Professor McGonagall , and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines . 
" We were — we were — " Ron stammered . 
" We were going to — to go and see — " " Hermione , " said Harry . 
Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him . 
I quite understand . 
Yes , 
I will inform Professor Binns where you ' ve gone . 
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione . 
It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that she had visitors , and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do . 
But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face . 
It was no easy task . 
Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it . 
Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it , too . 
Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land , there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk , known also as the King of Serpents . 
Spiders flee before the Basilisk , for it is their mortal enemy , and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster , which is fatal to it . 
And beneath this , a single word had been written , in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's . 
" Ron , " he breathed . 
" This is it . 
This is the answer . 
The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk — a giant serpent ! 
It's because I understand Parseltongue . . . 
Harry looked up at the beds around him . 
But no one's died — because no one looked it straight in the eye . 
Justin . . . 
" And Mrs . Norris ? " he whispered eagerly . 
Harry thought hard , picturing the scene on the night of Halloween . 
. " he said slowly . 
He scanned the page in his hand eagerly . 
The more he looked at it , the more it made sense . 
The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened ! 
It all fits ! " " But how's the basilisk been getting around the place ? " said Ron . " A giant snake . . . 
Harry , however , pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page . 
" Pipes , " he said . 
Ron , it's been using the plumbing . 
Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm . 
" The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets ! " he said hoarsely . 
" What if it's a bathroom ? 
What if it's in — " " — Moaning Myrtle's bathroom , " said Harry . 
" This means , " said Harry , " I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school . 
That's how he's been controlling the basilisk . " 
" What ' re we going to do ? " said Ron , whose eyes were flashing . 
" Should we go straight to McGonagall ? " " Let's go to the staffroom , " said Harry , jumping up . 
It's nearly break . " 
It was a large , paneled room full of dark , wooden chairs . 
Harry and Ron paced around it , too excited to sit down . 
" All students to return to their House dormitories at once . 
All teachers return to the staffroom . 
Immediately , please . " 
Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron . " Not another attack ? 
Not now ? " " What ' ll we do ? " said Ron , aghast . 
" Go back to the dormitory ? " 
" No , " said Harry , glancing around . 
There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left , full of the teachers ' cloaks . 
" In here . 
Let's hear what it's all about . 
They hid themselves inside it , listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead , and the staffroom door banging open . 
From between the musty folds of the cloaks , they watched the teachers filtering into the room . 
Then Professor McGonagall arrived . 
" A student has been taken by the monster . 
Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth . 
" The Heir of Slytherin , " said Professor McGonagall , who was very white , " left another message . 
" Which student ? " " Ginny Weasley , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" This is the end of Hogwarts . 
Dumbledore always said . . 
The staffroom door banged open again . 
But it was Lockhart , and he was beaming . 
" So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed ? " 
Snape stepped forward . 
" Just the man , " he said . 
" The very man . 
A girl has been snatched by the monster , Lockhart . 
Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself . 
" That's right , Gilderoy , " chipped in Professor Sprout . 
" Weren't you saying just last night that you ' ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is ? " " I — well , I — " sputtered Lockhart . 
" Yes , didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it ? " 
" D - did I ? I don't recall — " " I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested , " said Snape . 
" I — I really never — you may have misunderstood — " " We ' ll leave it to you , then , Gilderoy , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" V - very well , " he said . 
" I ' ll — I ' ll be in my office , getting — getting ready . " 
And he left the room . 
" Right , " said Professor McGonagall , whose nostrils were flared , 
It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life . 
He , Ron , Fred , and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room , unable to say anything to each other . 
Percy wasn't there . 
Near sunset , Fred and George went up to bed , unable to sit there any longer . 
" She knew something , Harry , " said Ron , speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom . 
" That's why she was taken . 
She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets . 
" I mean , she was a pureblood . 
Harry could see the sun sinking , blood - red , below the skyline . 
This was the worst he had ever felt . 
" Harry , " said Ron . " D ' you think there's any chance at all she's not — you know — " Harry didn't know what to say . 
" D ' you know what ? " said Ron . " I think we should go and see 
Lockhart . 
Tell him what we know . 
He's going to try and get into the Chamber . 
Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do , and because he wanted to be doing something , he agreed . 
The Gryffindors around them were so miserable , and felt so sorry for the Weasleys , that nobody tried to stop them as they got up , crossed the room , and left through the portrait hole . 
Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through it . 
" We think it ' ll help you . " 
Two large trunks stood open on the floor . 
The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk . 
" Are you going somewhere ? " said Harry . 
" Er , well , yes , " said Lockhart , ripping a life - size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up . 
" You can't go now ! 
" You wrote them ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" My dear boy , " said Lockhart , straightening up and frowning at Harry . 
And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin . 
" Harry , Harry , " said Lockhart , shaking his head impatiently , " it's not nearly as simple as that . 
I had to track these people down . 
Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did . 
He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them . 
" Let's see , " he said . 
" I think that's everything . 
Yes . 
He pulled out his wand and turned to them . 
Harry was still pointing his wand at him . 
" What d ' you want me to do ? " said Lockhart weakly . 
" I don't know where the Chamber of Secrets is . 
There's nothing I can do . " 
" You ' re in luck , " said Harry , forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint . 
" We think we know where it is . 
And what's inside it . 
Let's go . " 
They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs , along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall , to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking . 
Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet . 
" What do you want this time ? " 
" To ask you how you died , " said Harry . 
" It happened right in here . 
I died in this very stall . 
I remember it so well . 
The door was locked , and I was crying , and then I heard somebody come in . 
A different language , I think it must have been . 
Anyway , what really got me was that it was a boy speaking . 
" I died . " 
" How ? " said Harry . 
She looked dreamily at Harry . 
I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby , you see . 
" Where exactly did you see the eyes ? " said Harry . 
Harry and Ron hurried over to it . 
And then Harry saw it : Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake . 
" Harry , " said Ron . " Say something . 
Something in Parseltongue . " 
" But — " Harry thought hard . 
" Open up , " he said . 
He looked at Ron , who shook his head . 
" English , " he said . 
Harry looked back at the snake , willing himself to believe it was alive . 
" Open up , " he said . 
Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again . 
" I'm going down there , " he said . 
He couldn't not go , not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber , not if there was even the faintest , slimmest , wildest chance that Ginny might be alive . 
" Me too , " said Ron . 
There was a pause . 
" You can go first , " Ron snarled . 
" Boys , " he said , his voice feeble . 
" Boys , what good will it do ? " 
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand . 
Harry followed quickly . 
And then , just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground , the pipe leveled out , and he shot out of the end with a wet thud , landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in . 
Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe , too . 
" We must be miles under the school , " said Harry , his voice echoing in the black tunnel . 
" Under the lake , probably , " said Ron , squinting around at the dark , slimy walls . 
" Lumos ! " 
Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again . 
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight . 
But the tunnel was quiet as the grave , and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull . 
" Harry — there's something up there — " said Ron hoarsely , grabbing Harry's shoulder . 
Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved , lying right across the tunnel . 
Harry turned back to look at the thing , his heart beating so fast it hurt . 
" Blimey , " said Ron weakly . 
" Get up , " said Ron sharply , pointing his wand at Lockhart . 
Lockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron , knocking him to the ground . 
Harry jumped forward , but too late — Lockhart was straightening up , panting , Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face . 
" I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school , tell them I was too late to save the girl , and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body — say good - bye to your memories ! " 
He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled , " Obliviate ! " 
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb . 
Harry flung his arms over his head and ran , slipping over the coils of snake skin , out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor . 
" Ron ! " he shouted . 
" Are you okay ? 
Ron ! " " I'm here ! " 
came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall . 
There was a dull thud and a loud " ow ! " 
" What now ? " Ron's voice said , sounding desperate . 
Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling . 
Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours . . . . 
Harry knew there was only one thing to do . 
" Wait there , " he called to Ron . " Wait with Lockhart . 
I ' ll go on . . . . 
If I'm not back in an hour . . 
There was a very pregnant pause . 
" So you can — can get back through . 
And , Harry — " " See you in a bit , " said Harry , trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice . 
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone . 
The tunnel turned and turned again . 
He could guess what he had to do . 
He cleared his throat , and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker . 
" Open , " said Harry , in a low , faint hiss . 
The serpents parted as the wall cracked open , the halves slid smoothly out of sight , and Harry , shaking from head to foot , walked inside . 
He was standing at the end of a very long , dimly lit chamber . 
And where was Ginny ? 
He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns . 
Then , as he drew level with the last pair of pillars , a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view , standing against the back wall . 
Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above : It was ancient and monkeyish , with a long , thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes , where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor . 
" Ginny ! " 
Harry muttered , sprinting to her and dropping to his knees . 
" She won't wake , " said a soft voice . 
Harry jumped and spun around on his knees . 
Harry said desperately . 
" She's not — she's not — ? " " She's still alive , " said Riddle . 
" But only just . " 
Harry stared at him . 
" Are you a ghost ? " 
Harry said uncertainly . 
" A memory , " said Riddle quietly . 
He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes . 
" You ' ve got to help me , Tom , " Harry said , raising Ginny's head again . 
There's a basilisk . . . 
I don't know where it is , but it could be along any moment . . . . 
Harry , sweating , managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor , and bent to pick up his wand again . 
But his wand had gone . 
" Did you see — ? " 
He looked up . 
Riddle was still watching him — twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers . 
" Thanks , " said Harry , stretching out his hand for it . 
He continued to stare at Harry , twirling the wand idly . 
" We ' ve got to go ! 
Harry stared at him . 
" What d ' you mean , I won't be — ? " " I ' ve waited a long time for this , Harry Potter , " said Riddle . 
" For the chance to see you . 
To speak to you . " " Look , " said Harry , losing patience , " I don't think you get it . 
We're in the Chamber of Secrets . 
Harry stared at him . 
" Well , that's an interesting question , " said Riddle pleasantly . 
" What are you talking about ? " said Harry . 
" The diary , " said Riddle . 
All the time he spoke , Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face . 
" But I was patient . 
I wrote back . 
I was sympathetic , I was kind . 
I'm so glad I ' ve got this diary to confide in . . . . 
It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck . 
" If I say it myself , Harry , I ' ve always been able to charm the people I needed . 
" Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets . 
She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls . 
She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods , and the Squib's cat . " " No , " Harry whispered . 
" Yes , " said Riddle , calmly . 
It was very amusing . 
Dear Tom , " he recited , watching Harry's horrified face , " I think I'm losing my memory . 
Dear Tom , I can't remember what I did on the night of Halloween , but a cat was attacked and I ' ve got paint all down my front . 
Dear Tom , Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself . 
I think he suspects me . . . . 
There was another attack today and I don't know where I was . 
Tom , what am I going to do ? 
I think I'm going mad . . . . 
I think I'm the one attacking everyone , Tom ! " Harry's fists were clenched , the nails digging deep into his palms . 
And that's where you came in , Harry . 
Of all the people who could have picked it up , it was you , the very person I was most anxious to meet . . . 
. " " And why did you want to meet me ? " said Harry . 
Anger was coursing through him , and it was an effort to keep his voice steady . 
" Well , you see , Ginny told me all about you , Harry , " said Riddle . 
" I knew I must find out more about you , talk to you , meet you if I could . 
" And you framed him , didn't you ? 
On the one hand , Tom Riddle , poor but brilliant , parentless but so brave , school prefect , model student . . . on the other hand , big , blundering Hagrid , in trouble every other week , trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed , sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls . . . 
but I admit , even I was surprised how well the plan worked . 
It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance . . . 
as though Hagrid had the brains , or the power ! 
. " " I bet Dumbledore saw right through you , " said Harry , his teeth gritted . 
But I wasn't going to waste those long years I'd spent searching for it . 
" Well , you haven't finished it , " said Harry triumphantly . 
Harry stared at him . 
" Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened , it was Ginny who was writing to me , not you . 
She saw you with the diary , you see , and panicked . 
What if you found out how to work it , and I repeated all her secrets to you ? 
But I knew what I must do . 
It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir . 
She struggled and cried and became very boring . 
I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here . 
I knew you'd come . 
I have many questions for you , Harry Potter . " " Like what ? " 
Harry spat , fists still clenched . 
" Why do you care how I escaped ? " said Harry slowly . 
He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air , writing three shimmering words : tom marvolo riddle Then he waved the wand once , and the letters of his name rearranged themselves : i am lord voldemort " You see ? " he whispered . 
I , keep the name of a foul , common Muggle , who abandoned me even before I was born , just because he found out his wife was a witch ? 
No , Harry — I fashioned myself a new name , a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak , when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world ! " 
Harry's brain seemed to have jammed . 
" Not the greatest sorcerer in the world , " said Harry , breathing fast . 
" Sorry to disappoint you and all that , but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore . 
" Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me ! " he hissed . 
" He's not as gone as you might think ! " 
Harry retorted . 
Then , as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs , flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar . 
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared , piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling . 
It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons , which were gripping a ragged bundle . 
" That's a phoenix . . . 
. " said Riddle , staring shrewdly back at it . 
So it was . 
Do you feel brave , Harry Potter ? Do you feel safe now ? " 
Harry didn't answer . 
" To business , Harry , " said Riddle , still smiling broadly . 
And twice I failed to kill you . 
How did you survive ? 
Riddle had the wand . 
but the longer Riddle stood there , the more life was dwindling out of Ginny . . . 
and in the meantime , Harry noticed suddenly , Riddle's outline was becoming clearer , more solid . . . . 
But I know why you couldn't kill me . 
And I ' ve seen the real you , I saw you last year . 
You ' re a wreck . 
You ' re barely alive . 
You ' re in hiding . 
You ' re ugly , you ' re foul — " 
Riddle's face contorted . 
" So . 
Your mother died to save you . 
Yes , that's a powerful countercharm . 
I can see now . . . 
there is nothing special about you , after all . 
I wondered , you see . 
Even you must have noticed . 
Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself . 
That's all I wanted to know . " 
Harry stood , tense , waiting for Riddle to raise his wand . 
But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again . 
" Now , Harry , I'm going to teach you a little lesson . 
Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort , Heir of Salazar Slytherin , against famous Harry Potter , and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . 
Harry , fear spreading up his numb legs , watched Riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin , high above him in the half - darkness . 
Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue , Fawkes swaying on his shoulder . 
Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving . 
Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall , and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes ' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight . 
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber . 
Eyes still tightly shut , Harry began to run blindly sideways , his hands outstretched , feeling his way — Voldemort was laughing — Harry tripped . 
He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — the serpent was barely feet from him , he could hear it coming — There was a loud , explosive spitting sound right above him , and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall . 
His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor . 
The snake's tail thrashed , narrowly missing Harry , and before Harry could shut his eyes , it turned — Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes , both its great , bulbous yellow eyes , had been punctured by the phoenix ; blood was streaming to the floor , and the snake was spitting in agony . 
" NO ! " Harry heard Riddle screaming . 
Harry ducked . 
Something soft hit his face . 
Harry seized it . 
Stars winking in front of his eyes , he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it . 
A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat , its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs . 
He raised the sword in both his hands — The basilisk lunged again , and this time its aim was true — Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth — But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms , he felt a searing pain just above his elbow . 
One long , poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell , twitching , to the floor . 
Harry slid down the wall . 
He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm . 
But he knew it was too late . 
Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes , his vision went foggy . 
" Fawkes , " said Harry thickly . 
" You were fantastic , Fawkes . . . 
He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him . 
Even Dumbledore's bird knows it . 
Do you see what he's doing , Potter ? 
He's crying . " 
Harry blinked . 
" I'm going to sit here and watch you die , Harry Potter . 
I'm in no hurry . " 
Harry felt drowsy . 
" So ends the famous Harry Potter , " said Riddle's distant voice . 
" Alone in the Chamber of Secrets , forsaken by his friends , defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged . 
If this is dying , thought Harry , it's not so bad . 
But was this dying ? 
Instead of going black , the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus . 
Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes , still resting his head on Harry's arm . 
Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at Fawkes ; there was a bang like a gun , and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet . 
. " said Riddle quietly , staring at Harry's arm . 
" Of course . . . 
I forgot . . 
He looked into Harry's face . 
Just you and me , Harry Potter . . . 
you and me . . . 
He raised the wand — Then , in a rush of wings , Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap — the diary . 
For a split second , both Harry and Riddle , wand still raised , stared at it . 
Then , without thinking , without considering , as though he had meant to do it all along , Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book . 
Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents , streaming over Harry's hands , flooding the floor . 
Riddle was writhing and twisting , screaming and flailing and then — He had gone . 
Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence . 
Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary . 
Slowly , he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat , and , with a huge tug , retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth . 
Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber . 
Ginny was stirring . 
As Harry hurried toward her , she sat up . 
Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk , over Harry , in his blood - soaked robes , then to the diary in his hand . 
" Harry — oh , Harry — I tried to tell you at b - breakfast , but I c - couldn't say it in front of Percy — it was me , Harry — but I — I s - swear I d - didn't mean to — R - Riddle made me , he t - took me over — and — how did you kill that — that thing ? 
W - where's Riddle ? 
The last thing I r - remember is him coming out of the diary — " " It's all right , " said Harry , holding up the diary , and showing Ginny the fang hole , " Riddle's finished . 
C ' mon , Ginny , let's get out of here — " " I'm going to be expelled ! " 
Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet . 
" I ' ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B - Bill came and n - now I ' ll have to leave and — w - what ' ll Mum and Dad say ? " Fawkes was waiting for them , hovering in the Chamber entrance . 
Harry urged Ginny forward ; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk , through the echoing gloom , and back into the tunnel . 
" Ron ! " 
Harry yelled , speeding up . 
" Ginny's okay ! 
I ' ve got her ! " 
He heard Ron give a strangled cheer , and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rockfall . 
" Ginny ! " 
Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first . 
" You ' re alive ! 
I don't believe it ! 
What happened ? 
How — what — where did that bird come from ? " 
" He's Dumbledore's , " said Harry , squeezing through himself . 
" But — " " Later , " Harry said shortly . 
" Where's Lockhart ? " 
" He's in a bad way . 
Led by Fawkes , whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness , they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe . 
I told him to come and wait here . 
He's a danger to himself . " 
" Hello , " he said . 
Do you live here ? " 
" No , " said Ron , raising his eyebrows at Harry . 
Harry bent down and looked up the long , dark pipe . 
" Have you thought how we ' re going to get back up this ? " he said to Ron . 
Ron shook his head , but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him , his beady eyes bright in the dark . 
Harry looked uncertainly at him . 
" He looks like he wants you to grab hold . . 
. " said Ron , looking perplexed . 
He turned quickly to the others . 
" We ' ve got to hold on to each other . 
Professor Lockhart — " " He means you , " said Ron sharply to Lockhart . 
" You hold Ginny's other hand — " Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt , Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes , and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers . 
This is just like magic ! " 
The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair , and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride , it was over — all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom , and as Lockhart straightened his hat , the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place . 
Myrtle goggled at them . 
" You ' re alive , " she said blankly to Harry . 
" Oh , well . . . 
" Urgh ! " said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark , deserted corridor outside . 
" Harry ! 
Harry pointed . 
Fawkes was leading the way , glowing gold along the corridor . 
Harry knocked and pushed the door open . 
For a moment there was silence as Harry , Ron , Ginny , and Lockhart stood in the doorway , covered in muck and slime and ( in Harry's case ) blood . 
Then there was a scream . 
" Ginny ! " 
Harry , however , was looking past them . 
Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece , beaming , next to Professor McGonagall , who was taking great , steadying gasps , clutching her chest . 
Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's shoulder , just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs . 
You saved her ! How did you do it ? " 
" I think we'd all like to know that , " said Professor McGonagall weakly . 
Mrs . Weasley let go of Harry , who hesitated for a moment , then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat , the rubyencrusted sword , and what remained of Riddle's diary . 
Then he started telling them everything . 
For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence : He told them about hearing the disembodied voice , how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes ; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest , that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died ; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim , and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom . . . . 
But then he faltered . 
Harry thought in panic . 
Riddle's diary didn't work anymore . . . . 
" W - what's that ? " said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice . 
" YouKnow - Who ? 
En - enchant Ginny ? 
But Ginny's not . . . 
Ginny hasn't been . . . 
has she ? " " It was this diary , " said Harry quickly , picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore . 
Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long , crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages . 
" Brilliant , " he said softly . 
" But , Ginny , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" What's our Ginny got to do with — with — him ? " 
What have I always told you ? 
" I found it inside one of the books Mum got me . 
He strode over to the door and opened it . 
I always find that cheers me up , " he added , twinkling kindly down at her . " You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake . 
" So Hermione's okay ! " said Ron brightly . 
Mrs . Weasley led Ginny out , and Mr. Weasley followed , still looking deeply shaken . 
" You know , Minerva , " Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall , " I think all this merits a good feast . 
Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens ? " 
" Right , " said Professor McGonagall crisply , also moving to the door . 
" I ' ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley , shall I ? " " Certainly , " said Dumbledore . 
She left , and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore . 
" I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules , " said Dumbledore . 
Ron opened his mouth in horror . 
Harry gave a start . 
" Professor Dumbledore , " Ron said quickly , " there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets . 
Professor Lockhart — " " Am I a professor ? " said Lockhart in mild surprise . 
I expect I was hopeless , was I ? " " He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired , " Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore . 
He pointed at Harry . 
" Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary , too ? " Dumbledore said to Ron . " I'd like a few more words with Harry . . . 
Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire . 
" Sit down , Harry , " he said , and Harry sat , feeling unaccountably nervous . 
" First of all , Harry , I want to thank you , " said Dumbledore , eyes twinkling again . 
Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you . " 
" And so you met Tom Riddle , " said Dumbledore thoughtfully . 
" Professor Dumbledore . . . 
Riddle said I'm like him . 
Strange likenesses , he said . . . 
" And what do you think , Harry ? " " I don't think I'm like him ! " said Harry , more loudly than he'd intended . 
" I mean , I'm — I'm in Gryffindor , I'm . . 
" The Sorting Hat told me I'd — I'd have done well in Slytherin . 
Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while . . . 
because I can speak Parseltongue . . . 
Not something he intended to do , I'm sure . . . 
Harry said , thunderstruck . 
" Listen to me , Harry . 
" It only put me in Gryffindor , " said Harry in a defeated voice , " because I asked not to go in Slytherin . . . 
. " " Exactly , " said Dumbledore , beaming once more . 
Harry sat motionless in his chair , stunned . 
" If you want proof , Harry , that you belong in Gryffindor , I suggest you look more closely at this . " Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk , picked up the blood - stained silver sword , and handed it to Harry . 
Dully , Harry turned it over , the rubies blazing in the firelight . 
And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt . 
Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink . 
" What you need , Harry , is some food and sleep . 
I suggest you go down to the feast , while I write to Azkaban — we need our gamekeeper back . 
Dear me , we do seem to run through them , don't we ? " Harry got up and crossed to the door . 
He had just reached for the handle , however , when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall . 
" Good evening , Lucius , " said Dumbledore pleasantly . 
Dobby went scurrying in after him , crouching at the hem of his cloak , a look of abject terror on his face . 
The governors suspended you , but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts . " 
They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all . 
Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place . " 
" So — have you stopped the attacks yet ? " he sneered . 
" Well ? " said Mr. Malfoy sharply . 
" Who is it ? " 
He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center , watching Mr. Malfoy closely . 
Harry , however , was watching Dobby . 
His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry , he kept pointing at the diary , then at Mr. Malfoy , and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist . 
" I see . . 
. " said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore . 
" A clever plan , " said Dumbledore in a level voice , still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye . 
Mr. Malfoy said nothing . 
Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise . . . 
And still , behind his back , Dobby was pointing , first to the diary , then to Lucius Malfoy , then punching himself in the head . 
And Harry suddenly understood . 
He nodded at Dobby , and Dobby backed into a corner , now twisting his ears in punishment . 
" Because you gave it to her , " said Harry . 
" Oh , no one will be able to do that , " said Dumbledore , smiling at Harry . 
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment , and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand . 
" We're going , Dobby ! " 
He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him , he kicked him right through it . 
They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor . 
Harry stood for a moment , thinking hard . 
Then it came to him — " Professor Dumbledore , " he said hurriedly . 
" Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy , please ? " " Certainly , Harry , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" But hurry . 
Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office . 
He could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner . 
Then he ran down the dark corridor . 
He caught up with them at the top of the stairs . 
" Mr. 
" What the — ? " 
Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary , threw it aside , then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry . 
He turned to go . 
" Come , Dobby . 
I said , come . " 
" What did you say ? " " Got a sock , " said Dobby in disbelief . 
" Master threw it , and Dobby caught it , and Dobby — Dobby is free . " 
Lucius Malfoy stood frozen , staring at the elf . 
Then he lunged at Harry . 
But Dobby shouted , " You shall not harm Harry Potter ! " 
There was a loud bang , and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward . 
He got up , his face livid , and pulled out his wand , but Dobby raised a long , threatening finger . 
" You shall go now , " he said fiercely , pointing down at Mr. Malfoy . 
" You shall not touch Harry Potter . 
You shall go now . " 
Lucius Malfoy had no choice . 
With a last , incensed stare at the pair of them , he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight . 
" Harry Potter freed Dobby ! " said the elf shrilly , gazing up at Harry , moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb - like eyes . 
" Harry Potter set Dobby free ! " 
" Least I could do , Dobby , " said Harry , grinning . 
" Just promise never to try and save my life again . " 
Well — " " It was a clue , sir , " said Dobby , his eyes widening , as though this was obvious . 
" Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew ! " he sobbed . 
" Farewell , Harry Potter ! " 
Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts , but never one quite like this . 
You solved it ! " 
or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him , or Hagrid turning up at half past three , cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle , or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running , or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ( " Oh , no ! " said Hermione ) , or Dumbledore announcing that , unfortunately , Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year , owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back . 
Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news . 
" Shame , " said Ron , helping himself to a jam doughnut . 
" He was starting to grow on me . " 
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine . 
Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place . 
Too soon , it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred , George , and Ginny got a compartment to themselves . 
They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays . 
Harry was getting very good at it . 
" Oh , that , " said Ginny , giggling . 
" What ? " " It's that Ravenclaw prefect , Penelope Clearwater , " said Ginny . 
He's been meeting her all over the school in secret . 
He was so upset when she was — you know — attacked . 
You won't tease him , will you ? " 
Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione . 
Call me at the Dursleys ' , okay ? 
I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to . . . 
" Proud ? " said Harry . 
" Are you crazy ? 
All those times I could ' ve died , and I didn't manage it ? 
And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world .
Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways . 
For one thing , he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year . 
For another , he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret , in the dead of night . 
It was nearly midnight , and he was lying on his stomach in bed , the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent , a flashlight in one hand and a large leather - bound book ( A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot ) propped open against the pillow . 
Harry moved the tip of his eagle - feather quill down the page , frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay , ' Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss . ' 
The quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph . 
On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard , burning had no effect whatsoever . 
Indeed , Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty - seven times in various disguises . 
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his inkbottle and a roll of parchment . 
Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle , dipped his quill into it , and began to write , pausing every now and then to listen , because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom , he'd probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer . 
The Dursley family of Number Four , Privet Drive , was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and their son , Dudley , were Harry's only living relatives . 
For years , Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible , they would be able to squash the magic out of him . 
These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
The most they could do , however , was to lock away Harry's spell books , wand , cauldron , and broomstick at the start of the summer break , and forbid him to talk to the neighbors . 
This separation from his spell books had been a real problem for Harry , because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work . 
One of the essays , a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions , was for Harry's least favorite teacher , Professor Snape , who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month . 
Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays . 
While Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car ( in very loud voices , so that the rest of the street would notice it too ) , Harry had crept downstairs , picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs , grabbed some of his books , and hidden them in his bedroom . 
As long as he didn't leave spots of ink on the sheets , the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night . 
Ron Weasley , who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts , came from a whole family of wizards . 
Harry , who happened to be in the room at the time , froze as he heard Ron's voice answer . 
" WHO IS THIS ? " he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece . 
" I ' M — A — FRIEND — OF — HARRY ' S — FROM — SCHOOL — " Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry , who was rooted to the spot . 
Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts , Hermione Granger , hadn't been in touch either . 
Harry suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call , which was a pity , because Hermione , the cleverest witch in Harry's year , had Muggle parents , knew perfectly well how to use a telephone , and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts . 
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks , and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one . 
There was just one very small improvement — after swearing that he wouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends , Harry had been allowed to let his owl , Hedwig , out at night . 
Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time . 
Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again . 
The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant , grunting snores of his enormous cousin , Dudley . 
It must be very late , Harry thought . 
His eyes were itching with tiredness . 
Perhaps he'd finish this essay tomorrow night … He replaced the top of the ink bottle ; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed ; put the flashlight , A History of Magic , his essay , quill , and ink inside it ; got out of bed ; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed . 
Then he stood up , stretched , and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table . 
It was one o ' clock in the morning . 
Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt . 
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays . 
He had never received a birthday card in his life . 
The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays , and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one . 
Harry walked across the dark room , past Hedwig's large , empty cage , to the open window . 
He leaned on the sill , the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets . 
Hedwig had been absent for two nights now . 
The eyes behind his glasses were bright green , and on his forehead , clearly visible through his hair , was a thin scar , shaped like a bolt of lightning . 
Of all the unusual things about Harry , this scar was the most extraordinary of all . 
It was not , as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years , a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents , because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash . 
For a split second he hesitated , his hand on the window latch , wondering whether to slam it shut . 
But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive , and Harry , realizing what it was , leapt aside . 
Through the window soared three owls , two of them holding up the third , which appeared to be unconscious . 
They landed with a soft flump on Harry's bed , and the middle owl , which was large and gray , keeled right over and lay motionless . 
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol , and he belonged to the Weasley family . 
Harry dashed to the bed , untied the cords around Errol's legs , took off the parcel , and then carried Errol to Hedwig's cage . 
Harry turned back to the remaining owls . 
One of them , the large snowy female , was his own Hedwig . 
Harry didn't recognize the third owl , a handsome tawny one , but he knew at once where it had come from , because in addition to a third package , it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest . 
When Harry relieved this owl of its burden , it ruffled its feathers importantly , stretched its wings , and took off through the window into the night . 
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol's package , ripped off the brown paper , and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card . 
Fingers trembling slightly , he opened the envelope . 
Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a newspaper clipping . 
The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper , the Daily Prophet , because the people in the black - and - white picture were moving . 
Harry picked up the clipping , smoothed it out , and read : MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE Arthur Weasley , Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic , has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw . 
A delighted Mr . Weasley told the Daily Prophet , " We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt , where our eldest son , Bill , works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank . " 
The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt , returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts , which five of the Weasley children currently attend . 
Harry scanned the moving photograph , and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him , standing in front of a large pyramid . 
Right in the middle of the picture was Ron , tall and gangling , with his pet rat , Scabbers , on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister , Ginny . 
He picked up Ron's letter and unfolded it . 
Dear Harry , Happy birthday ! 
Look , I'm really sorry about that telephone call . 
I asked Dad , and he reckons I shouldn't have shouted . 
It's amazing here in Egypt . 
I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw . 
Most of it's gone on this trip , but they ' re going to buy me a new wand for next year . 
It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds . 
Harry glanced back at the photograph . 
Percy , who was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts , was looking particularly smug . 
He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair , his horn - rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun . 
Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top . 
Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope . 
If there's someone untrustworthy around , it's supposed to light up and spin . 
Bye — Ron 
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table , where it stood quite still , balanced on its point , reflecting the luminous hands of his clock . 
He looked at it happily for a few seconds , then picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought . 
Inside this , too , there was a wrapped present , a card , and a letter , this time from Hermione . 
Dear Harry , Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon . 
I do hope you ' re all right . 
I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going to send this to you — what if they'd opened it at customs ? — but then Hedwig turned up ! 
There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here , too . 
I ' ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I ' ve found out , I hope it's not too long — it's two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for . 
Ron says he's going to be in London in the last week of the holidays . 
Can you make it ? 
Will your aunt and uncle let you come ? 
I really hope you can . 
If not , I ' ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first ! 
Ron doesn't seem too happy about it . 
Harry laughed as he put Hermione's letter aside and picked up her present . 
It was very heavy . 
Knowing Hermione , he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells — but it wasn't . 
" Wow , Hermione ! " 
Harry whispered , unzipping the case to look inside . 
There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High - Finish Handle Polish , a pair of gleaming silver TailTwig Clippers , a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys , and a Handbook of DoIt - Yourself Broomcare . 
Apart from his friends , the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch , the most popular sport in the magical world — highly dangerous , very exciting , and played on broomsticks . 
Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player ; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams . 
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel . 
He recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once : this was from Hagrid , the Hogwarts gamekeeper . 
He tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery , but before he could unwrap it properly , the parcel gave a strange quiver , and whatever was inside it snapped loudly — as though it had jaws . 
Harry froze . 
He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose , but then , Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of what was dangerous . 
It snapped loudly again . 
Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table , gripped it firmly in one hand , and raised it over his head , ready to strike . 
Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled . 
And out fell — a book . 
Harry just had time to register its handsome green cover , emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of Monsters , before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab . 
" Uh - oh , " Harry muttered . 
The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room . 
Harry followed it stealthily . 
The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk . 
Uncle Vernon gave a loud , sleepy grunt in the room next door . 
Dear Harry , Happy Birthday ! 
Tell you when I see you . 
Hope the Muggles are treating you right . 
All the best , Hagrid 
It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful , but he put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's , grinning more broadly than ever . 
Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left . 
Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual , Harry slit open the envelope , pulled out the first page of parchment within , and read : Dear Mr . Potter , Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first . 
The Hogwarts Express will leave from King's Cross station , platform nine and three - quarters , at eleven o ' clock . 
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends . 
Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign . 
But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form ? 
He looked over at the alarm clock . 
It was now two o ' clock in the morning . 
Deciding that he'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up , Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart he'd made for himself , counting down the days left until his return to Hogwarts . 
Then he took off his glasses and lay down ; eyes open , facing his three birthday cards . 
Extremely unusual though he was , at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad , for the first time in his life , that it was his birthday . 
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table . 
They were watching a brand - new television , a welcome - home - for - the - summer present for Dudley , who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room . 
Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen , his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually . 
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon , a large , beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache . 
Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday , none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room , but Harry was far too used to this to care . 
He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television , who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict . 
" … the public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous . 
" No need to tell us he's no good , " snorted Uncle Vernon , staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner . 
" Look at the state of him , the filthy layabout ! 
Look at his hair ! " 
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry , whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon . 
" The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today — " " Hang on ! " barked Uncle Vernon , staring furiously at the reporter . 
What use is that ? 
Lunatic could be coming up the street right now ! " Aunt Petunia , who was bony and horse - faced , whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window . 
Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number . 
She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring , law - abiding neighbors . 
" Aunt Marge ? " he blurted out . 
" Sh - she's not coming here , is she ? " Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister . 
Aunt Marge lived in the country , in a house with a large garden , where she bred bulldogs . 
At Dudley's fifth birthday party , Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues . 
A few years later , she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry . 
On her last visit , the year before Harry started at Hogwarts , Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog . 
Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree , and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight . 
" Marge ' ll be here for a week , " Uncle Vernon snarled , " and while we ' re on the subject , " he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry , " we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her . " Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television . 
" Firstly , " growled Uncle Vernon , " you ' ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you ' re talking to Marge . " " All right , " said Harry bitterly , " if she does when she's talking to me . " " Secondly , " said Uncle Vernon , acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply , " as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality , I don't want any — any funny stuff while she's here . 
Harry yelled . 
Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit — it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him , including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks . 
" Well , Petunia , " said Uncle Vernon , getting heavily to his feet , " I ' ll be off to the station , then . 
Want to come along for the ride , Dudders ? " " No , " said Dudley , whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry . 
" See you in a bit , then , " he said , and he left the kitchen . 
Abandoning his toast , he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door . 
" Like I wanted to come , " said Harry coldly . 
" I want to ask you something . " 
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously . 
" Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes , " said Harry . 
" I need you to sign the permission form , " said Harry in a rush . 
" And why should I do that ? " 
sneered Uncle Vernon . 
Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys ! " bellowed Uncle Vernon , and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon's voice . 
" Exactly , " said Harry , looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large , purple face . 
" It's a lot to remember . 
" But if you sign my permission form , " Harry went on quickly , " I swear I ' ll remember where I'm supposed to go to school , and I ' ll act like a Mug — like I'm normal and everything . " 
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over , even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple . 
" Right , " he snapped finally . 
" I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge's visit . 
If , at the end of it , you ' ve toed the line and kept to the story , I ' ll sign your ruddy form . " 
He wheeled around , pulled open the front door , and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out . 
Harry didn't return to the kitchen . 
He went back upstairs to his bedroom . 
If he was going to act like a real Muggle , heed better start now . 
Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework . 
Then he went to Hedwig's cage . 
Harry sighed , then poked them both awake . 
" Hedwig , " he said gloomily , " you ' re going to have to clear off for a week . 
And don't look at me like that " — Hedwig's large amber eyes were reproachful — " it's not my fault . 
It's the only way I ' ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione . " 
Ten minutes later , Errol and Hedwig ( who had a note to Ron bound to her leg ) soared out of the window and out of sight . 
Harry , now feeling thoroughly miserable , put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe . 
But Harry didn't have long to brood . 
In next to no time , Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest . 
Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat . 
All too soon , there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car pulled back into the driveway , then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path . 
" Get the door ! " Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry . 
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach , Harry pulled the door open . 
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge . 
She was very like Uncle Vernon : large , beefy , and purplefaced , she even had a mustache , though not as bushy as his . 
" Where's my Dudders ? " roared Aunt Marge . 
Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry's stomach , knocking the wind out of him , seized Dudley in a tight one - armed hug , and planted a large kiss on his cheek . 
" Petunia ! " 
Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed , or rather , Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunias bony cheekbone . 
Uncle Vernon now came in , smiling jovially as he shut the door . 
" Tea , Marge ? " he said . 
" And what will Ripper take ? " " Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer , " said Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen , leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase . 
But Harry wasn't complaining ; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him , so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom , taking as long as he could . 
By the time he got back to the kitchen , Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake , and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner . 
Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor . 
Aunt Petunia hated animals . 
" Who's looking after the other dogs , Marge ? " Uncle Vernon asked . 
" He's retired now , good for him to have something to do . 
He pines if he's away from me . " Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down . 
This directed Aunt Marge's attention to Harry for the first time . 
" So ! " she barked . 
" Still here , are you ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Don't you say ' yes ' in that ungrateful tone , " Aunt Marge growled . 
" It's damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you . 
Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys , but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him . 
He forced his face into a painful smile . 
" I can see you haven't improved since I last saw you . 
She took a large gulp of tea , wiped her mustache , and said , " Where is it that you send him , again , Vernon ? " " St . 
Brutus's , " said Uncle Vernon promptly . 
" I see , " said Aunt Marge . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
Then , feeling he might as well do the thing properly , he added , " All the time . " 
" Excellent , " said Aunt Marge . 
A good thrashing is what's needed in ninety - nine cases out of a hundred . 
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes . 
" I still don't like your tone , boy , " she said . 
Petunia , I'd write if I were you . 
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain ; in any case , he changed the subject abruptly . 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way , which Harry was only too happy to do . 
She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley , and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry , as though daring him to ask why he hadn't got a present too . 
" You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out , Vernon , " she said over lunch on the third day . 
Harry tried to concentrate on his food , but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger . 
Think about Hogsmeade . 
Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine . 
" It's one of the basic rules of breeding , " she said . 
If there's something wrong with the bitch , there ' ll be something wrong with the pup — " At that moment , the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her hand . 
" Marge ! " squealed Aunt Petunia . 
" Marge , are you all right ? " 
" Must have squeezed it too hard . 
Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster's the other day . 
No need to fuss , Petunia , I have a very firm grip … " But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously , so he decided he'd better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could . 
Outside in the hall , he leaned against the wall , breathing deeply . 
It had been a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode . 
He couldn't afford to let it happen again . 
The Hogsmeade form wasn't the only thing at stake — if he carried on like that , he'd be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic . 
Only last summer he'd gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive , Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts . 
He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way . 
Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his Handbook of Do - ItYourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him . 
Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine . 
They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry's faults ; during the lemon meringue pie , Uncle Vernon bored them a with a long talk about Grunnings , his drill - making company ; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy . 
" Can I tempt you , Marge ? " Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine . 
Her huge face was very red . 
" A bit more than that … and a bit more … that's the ticket . " 
Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out . 
Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom , but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out . 
" Excellent nosh , Petunia . 
" Pardon me . 
I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year . 
Weak . 
Now , I'm saying nothing against your family , Petunia " — she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovel - like one " but your sister was a bad egg . 
They turn up in the best families . 
Harry was staring at his plate , a funny ringing in his ears . 
But he couldn't remember what came next . 
Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon's drills . 
Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents . 
Harry was shaking all over . 
He had never felt so angry in his life . 
" Go to bed , go on — " " No , Vernon , " hiccupped Aunt Marge , holding up a hand , her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry's . 
" Go on , boy , go on . 
Proud of your parents , are you ? 
They go and get themselves killed in a car crash ( drunk , I expect ) — " " They didn't die in a car crash ! " said Harry , who found himself on his feet . 
" They died in a car crash , you nasty little liar , and left you to be a burden on their decent , hardworking relatives ! " 
screamed Aunt Marge , swelling with fury . 
She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger — but the swelling didn't stop . 
Her great red face started to expand , her tiny eyes bulged , and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech — next second , several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls — she was inflating like a monstrous balloon , her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband , each of her fingers blowing up like a salami … " MARGE ! " yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling . 
Ripper came skidding into the room , barking madly . 
Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down again , but was almost lifted from the floor himself . 
A second later , Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg . 
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him , heading for the cupboard under the stairs . 
In seconds , he had heaved his trunk to the front door . 
He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed , wrenching up the loose floorboard , and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents . 
He wriggled out , seized Hedwig's empty cage , and dashed back downstairs to his trunk , just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room , his trouser leg in bloody tatters . 
He kicked his trunk open , pulled out his wand , and pointed it at Uncle Vernon . 
" She deserved it , " Harry said , breathing very fast . 
He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door . 
" I'm going , " Harry said . 
" I ' ve had enough . " 
And in the next moment , he was out in the dark , quiet street , heaving his heavy trunk behind him , Hedwig's cage under his arm . 
He sat quite still , anger still surging through him , listening to the frantic thumping of his heart . 
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street , a new emotion overtook him : panic . 
Whichever way he looked at it , he had never been in a worse fix . 
He was stranded , quite alone , in the dark Muggle world , with absolutely nowhere to go . 
He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly , he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren't swooping down on him where he sat . 
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent . 
What , was going to happen to him ? 
Would he be arrested , or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world ? 
He thought of Ron and Hermione , and his heart sank even lower . 
Harry was sure that , criminal or not , Ron and Hermione would want to help him now , but they were both abroad , and with Hedwig gone , he had no means of contacting them . 
He didn't have any Muggle money , either . 
There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk , but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London . 
He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London . 
Unless … He looked down at his wand , which he was still clutching in his hand . 
He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father — what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather - light , tied it to his broomstick , covered himself in the cloak , and flew to London ? 
Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and … begin his life as an outcast . 
It was a horrible prospect , but he couldn't sit on this wall forever , or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick . 
Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside , looking for the Invisibility Cloak — but before he had found it , he straightened up suddenly , looking around him once more . 
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched , but the street appeared to be deserted , and no lights shone from any of the large square houses . 
He bent over his trunk again , but almost immediately stood up once more , his hand clenched on his wand . 
He had sensed rather than heard it : someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him . 
Harry squinted at the black alleyway . 
If only it would move , then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or — something else . 
" Lumos , " Harry muttered , and a light appeared at the end of his wand , almost dazzling him . 
He held it high over his head , and the pebble - dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled ; the garage door gleamed , and between them Harry saw , quite distinctly , the hulking outline of something very big , with wide , gleaming eyes . 
Harry stepped backward . 
His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall , and he landed , hard , in the gutter . 
There was a deafening BANG , and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light … With a yell , he rolled back onto the pavement , just in time . 
A second later , a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying . 
For a split second , Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall . 
Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night . 
" Welcome to the Knight Bus , emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand , step on board , and we can take you anywhere you want to go . 
Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet . 
Close up , he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was , eighteen or nineteen at most , with large , protruding ears and quite a few pimples . 
" Fell over , " said Harry . 
" I didn't do it on purpose , " said Harry , annoyed . 
One of the knees in his jeans was torn , and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding . 
He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence . 
With a feeling of unease , Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead . 
" Nothing , " said Harry quickly , flattening his hair over his scar . 
If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him , he didn't want to make it too easy for them . 
" Neville Longbottom , " said Harry , saying the first name that came into his head . 
" So — so this bus , " he went on quickly , hoping to distract Stan , " did you say it goes anywhere ? " 
" Yep , " said Stan proudly , " anywhere you like , ' long it's on land . 
He and Stan then lifted his trunk , with Hedwig's cage balanced on top , up the steps of the bus . 
A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered , " Not now , thanks , I'm pickling some slugs " and rolled over in his sleep . 
" You ' ave this one , " Stan whispered , shoving Harry's trunk under the bed right behind the driver , who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel . 
" This is our driver , Ernie Prang . 
There was another tremendous BANG , and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed , thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus . 
Pulling himself up , Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street . 
" Where are we , Ern ? Somewhere in Wales ? " " Ar , " said Ernie . 
" How come the Muggles don't hear the bus ? " said Harry . 
Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase . 
Harry was still looking out of the window , feeling increasingly nervous . 
Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel . 
Stan came back downstairs , followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak . 
" ' Ere you go , Madam Marsh , " said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus . 
Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut ; there was another loud BANG , and they were thundering down a narrow country lane , trees leaping out of the way . 
His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him , and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet . 
Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth . 
A large photograph of a sunken - faced man with long , matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page . 
He looked strangely familiar . 
" That man ! " Harry said , forgetting his troubles for a moment . 
" He was on the Muggle news ! " Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled . 
Where you been ? " 
He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face , removed the front page , and handed it to Harry . 
Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read : BLACK STILL AT LARGE Sirius Black , possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress , is still eluding capture , the Ministry of Magic confirmed today . 
" We are doing all we can to recapture Black , " said the Minister of Magic , Cornelius Fudge , this morning , " and we beg the magical community to remain calm . " 
Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis . 
" Well , really , I had to , don't you know , " said an irritable Fudge . 
" Black is mad . 
He's a danger to anyone who crosses him , magic or Muggle . 
I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black's true identity to anyone . 
While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun ( a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other ) , the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago , when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse . 
Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black , the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive . 
Harry had never met a vampire , but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes , and Black , with his waxy white skin , looked just like one . 
" He murdered thirteen people ? " said Harry , handing the page back to Stan , " with one curse ? " 
" Yep , " said Stan , " in front of witnesses an ' all . 
Stan swiveled in his armchair , his hands on the back , the better to look at Harry . 
" What , Voldemort ? " said Harry , without thinking . 
Even Stan's pimples went white ; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus . 
" ' Choo say ' is name for ? " " Sorry , " said Harry hastily . 
" Sorry , I — I forgot — " " Forgot ! " said Stan weakly . 
Harry prompted apologetically . 
" Yeah , that's right . 
But not Sirius Black . 
" Anyway , they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an ' Black took out ' is wand and ' e blasted ' alf the street apart , an ' a wizard got it , an'so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place . 
Stan put the paper away reluctantly , and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus , feeling worse than ever . 
Blew up ' is aunt ! 
Hagrid , the Hogwarts gamekeeper , had spent two months there only last year . 
Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going , and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew . 
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness , scattering bushes and wastebaskets , telephone booths and trees , and Harry lay , restless and miserable , on his feather bed . 
After a while , Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate , but poured it all over Harry's pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen . 
One by one , wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus . 
They all looked very pleased to go . 
Finally , Harry was the only passenger left . 
" Right then , Neville , " said Stan , clapping his hands , " whereabouts in London ? " " Diagon Alley , " said Harry . 
They were thundering along Charing Cross Road . 
Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way . 
The sky was getting a little lighter . 
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabbylooking pub , the Leaky Cauldron , behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley . 
" Thanks , " Harry said to Ern . 
He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's cage onto the pavement . 
" Well , " said Harry . 
Still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron . 
" There you are , Harry , " said a voice . 
Before Harry could turn , he felt a hand on his shoulder . 
At the same time , Stan shouted , " Blimey ! 
Come ' ere ! " 
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach — he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic himself . 
" What didja call Neville , Minister ? " he said excitedly . 
Fudge , a portly little man in a long , pinstriped cloak , looked cold and exhausted . 
" This is Harry Potter . " " I knew it ! " 
I can see ' is scar ! " " Yes , " said Fudge testily , " well , I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up , but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now … " Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder , and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub . 
A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar . 
Brandy ? " " Perhaps a pot of tea , " said Fudge , who still hadn't let go of Harry . 
There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them , and Stan and Ern appeared , carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around excitedly . 
" ' Ow come you di ' n't tell us ' oo you are , eh , Neville ? " said Stan , beaming at Harry , while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over Stan's shoulder . 
" Bye , " Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar . 
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern , and then into a small parlor . 
Tom clicked his fingers , a fire burst into life in the grate , and he bowed himself out of the room . 
" Sit down , Harry , " said Fudge , indicating a chair by the fire . 
Harry sat down , feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire . 
Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside , then hitched up the trousers of his bottle - green suit and sat down opposite Harry . 
The Minister of Magic . " 
Harry already knew this , of course ; he had seen Fudge once before , but as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time , Fudge wasn't to know that . 
Tom the innkeeper reappeared , wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets . 
He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor , closing the door behind him . 
Running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that ! 
Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago . 
She has no recollection of the incident at all . 
So that's that , and no harm done . " 
Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup , rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew . 
Harry , who couldn't believe his ears , opened his mouth to speak , couldn't think of anything to say , and closed it again . 
" Ah , you ' re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle ? " said Fudge . 
" Well , I won't deny that they are extremely angry , Harry , but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays . " 
Harry unstuck his throat . 
" I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays , " he said , " and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive . " 
" Now , now , I'm sure you ' ll feel differently once you ' ve calmed down , " said Fudge in a worried tone . 
He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now . 
" So all that remains , " said Fudge , now buttering himself a second crumpet , " is to decide where you ' re going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation . 
" What about my punishment ? " 
" I broke the law ! " 
Harry said . 
" It was an accident ! 
" Last year , I got an official warning just because a house - elf smashed a pudding in my uncle's house ! " he told Fudge , frowning . 
Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him , Fudge was suddenly looking awkward . 
" Circumstances change , Harry … We have to take into account … in the present climate … Surely you don't want to be expelled ? " 
" Of course I don't , " said Harry . 
" Well then , what's all the fuss about ? " laughed Fudge . 
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him . 
There was something extremely odd going on . 
And now Harry came to think of it , surely it wasn't usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic ? 
" Room eleven's free , Harry , " said Fudge . 
" I think you ' ll be very comfortable just one thing , and I'm sure you ' ll understand … I don't want you wandering off into Muggle London , all right ? 
And you ' re to be back here before dark each night . 
Sure you ' ll understand . 
" Okay , " said Harry slowly , " but why ? " " Don't want to lose you again , do we ? " said Fudge with a hearty laugh . 
Harry asked . 
Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak . 
" What's that ? 
Oh , you ' ve heard - well , no , not yet , but it's only a matter of time . 
" So , I ' ll say good - bye . " 
He held out his hand and Harry , shaking it , had a sudden idea . 
" Er — Minister ? 
Can I ask you something ? " 
" Certainly , " said Fudge with a smile . 
" Ah , " he said . 
" No , no , I'm very sorry , Harry , but as I'm not your parent or guardian — " " But you ' re the Minister of Magic , " said Harry eagerly . 
In fact , I think it's best if you don't … yes … well , I ' ll be off . 
Enjoy your stay , Harry . " 
And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand , Fudge left the room . 
Inside was a very comfortable - looking bed , some highly polished oak furniture , a cheerfully crackling fire and , perched on top of the wardrobe — " Hedwig ! " 
Harry gasped . 
Harry sat on his bed for a long time , absentmindedly stroking Hedwig . 
The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep , velvety blue to cold , steely gray and then , slowly , to pink shot with gold . 
It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom . 
Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied . 
He could even go wherever he pleased , as long as it was in Diagon Alley , and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world , Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world . 
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron , where he liked watching the other guests : funny little witches from the country , up for a day's shopping ; venerable - looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today ; wild - looking warlocks ; raucous dwarfs ; and once , what looked suspiciously like a hag , who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woolen balaclava . 
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard , take out his wand , tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin , and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall . 
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes , where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases ( " It's a lunascope , old boy — no more messing around with moon charts , see ? " ) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black ( " Personally , I won't let any of the children out alone until he's back in Azkaban " ) . 
Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons , silver Sickles , and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts , he had to exercise a lot of self - control not to spend the whole lot at once . 
He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts , and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks , to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones ( a wizarding game rather like marbles , in which the stones squirt a nasty - smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point ) . 
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at , Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium , on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life . 
" It's the fastest broom in the world , isn't it , Dad ? " squeaked a boy younger than Harry , who was swinging off his father's arm . 
" Irish International Side's just put in an order for seven of these beauties ! " the proprietor of the shop told the crowd . 
He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life — but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand , and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt , when he had a very good broom already ? 
Harry didn't ask for the price , but he returned , almost every day after that , just to look at the Firebolt . 
There were , however , things that Harry needed to buy . 
He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients , and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg , he visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones . 
Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window . 
Instead of the usual display of gold - embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs , there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters . 
Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time . 
The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures . 
He felt relieved ; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet . 
" Hogwarts ? " he said abruptly . 
" Yes , " said Harry , " I need — " " Get out of the way , " said the manager impatiently , brushing Harry aside . 
He drew on a pair of very thick gloves , picked up a large , knobbly walking stick , and proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books ' cage . 
" Have you ? " 
I ' ve been bitten five times already this morning — " A loud ripping noise rent the air ; two of the Monster Books had seized a third and were pulling it apart . 
" Stop it ! 
Stop it ! " 
cried the manager , poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart . 
" I'm never stocking them again , never ! 
It's been bedlam ! 
I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility — cost a fortune , and we never found them … Well … is there anything else I can help you with ? " " Yes , " said Harry , looking down his booklist , " I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky . " 
" Ah , starting Divination , are you ? " said the manager , stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop , where there was a corner devoted to fortune - telling . 
" Here you are , " said the manager , who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick , blackbound book . 
" Unfogging the Future . 
His eyes had fallen on another book , which was among a display on a small table : Death Omens — What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming . 
" Oh , I wouldn't read that if I were you , " said the manager lightly , looking to see what Harry was staring at . 
It's enough to frighten anyone to death . " 
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book ; it showed a black dog large as a bear , with gleaming eyes . 
" Anything else ? " he said . 
" Yes , " said Harry , tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedly consulting his booklist . 
Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron , hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people . 
He tramped up the stairs to his room , went inside , and tipped his books onto his bed . 
Somebody had been in to tidy ; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside . 
Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley . 
He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin . 
" I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent … It was probably just a stray dog … " He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat " You ' re fighting a losing battle there , dear , " said his mirror in a wheezy voice . 
As the days slipped by , Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione . 
Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now , with the start of term so near . 
Harry didn't stop to chat ; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable - looking grandmother . 
Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic . 
Harry woke on the last day of the holidays , thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow , on the Hogwarts Express . 
" Harry ! 
" Finally ! " said Ron , grinning at Harry as he sat down . 
" We went to the Leaky Cauldron , but they said you'd left , and we went to Flourish and Blotts , and Madam Malkin's , and — " " I got all my school stuff last week , " Harry explained . 
" Dad , " said Ron simply . 
Mr . Weasley , who worked at the Ministry of Magic , would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge . 
" Did you really blow up your aunt , Harry ? " said Hermione in a very serious voice . 
" I just — lost control . " 
" It's not funny , Ron , " said Hermione sharply . 
" Forget expelled , I thought I was going to be arrested . " 
shrugged Ron , still chuckling . 
" Famous Harry Potter and all that . 
I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to me if I blew up an aunt . 
Hermione's there as well ! " Hermione nodded , beaming . 
" Excellent ! " said Harry happily . 
" So , have you got all your new books and stuff ? " " Look at this , " said Ron , pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it . 
" Brand - new wand . 
" What about those Monster Books , eh ? 
" What's all that , Hermione ? " 
" Those are my books for Arithmancy , Care of Magical Creatures , Divination , the Study of Ancient Runes , Muggle Studies — " " What are you doing Muggle Studies for ? " said Ron , rolling his eyes at Harry . 
" You ' re Muggleborn ! 
Your mum and dad are Muggles ! 
" Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year , Hermione ? " asked Harry , while Ron sniggered . 
Hermione ignored them . 
" It's my birthday in September , and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present . " 
" How about a nice book ? said Ron innocently . 
" No , I don't think so , " said Hermione composedly . 
" I really want an owl . 
I mean , Harry's got Hedwig and you ' ve got Errol — " " I haven't , " said Ron . " Errol's a family owl . 
He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket . 
" And I want to get him checked over , " he added , placing Scabbers on the table in front of them . 
" There's a magical creature shop just over there , " said Harry , who knew Diagon Alley very well by now . 
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie . 
Every inch of wall was hidden by cages . 
The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double - ended newts , so Harry , Ron , and Hermione waited , examining the cages . 
Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank , and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise . 
Then there were cats of every color , a noisy cage of ravens , a basket of funny custard - colored furballs that were humming loudly , and on the counter , a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long , bald tails . 
The double - ended newt wizard left , and Ron approached the counter . 
" He's been a bit off - color ever since I brought him back from Egypt . " " Bang him on the counter , " said the witch , pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket . 
Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats , who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took . 
Like nearly everything Ron owned , Scabbers the rat was secondhand ( he had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy ) and a bit battered . 
Next to the glossy rats in the cage , he looked especially woebegone . 
" How old is this rat ? " " Dunno , " said Ron . " Quite old . 
He used to belong to my brother . " 
Ron muttered , " Show - offs . " 
" Well , if you don't want a replacement , you can try this rat tonic , " said the witch , reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle . 
" Okay , " said Ron . " How much — OUCH ! " Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage , landed on his head , and then propelled itself , spitting madly , at Scabbers . 
" NO , CROOKSHANKS , NO ! " cried the witch , but Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap , landed splay - legged on the floor , and then scampered for the door . 
Ron shouted , racing out of the shop after him ; Harry followed . 
Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up , massaging his head . 
" What was that ? " " It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger , " said Harry . 
" Where's Hermione ? " 
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie . 
" He's gorgeous , isn't he ? " said Hermione , glowing . 
That was a matter of opinion , thought Harry . 
Now that Scabbers was out of sight , however , the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione's arms . 
" Hermione , that thing nearly scalped me ! " said Ron . " He didn't mean to , did you , Crookshanks ? " said Hermione . 
" And what about Scabbers ? " said Ron , pointing at the lump in his chest pocket . 
" He needs rest and relaxation ! 
How's he going to get it with that thing around ? " 
" That reminds me , you forgot your rat tonic , " said Hermione , slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand . 
" And stop worrying , Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours , what's the problem ? 
They found Mr . Weasley sitting in the bar , reading the Daily Prophet . 
" Harry ! " he said , smiling as he looked up . 
" How are you ? " 
Mr . Weasley put down his paper , and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him . 
asked Ron . 
At that moment Mrs . Weasley entered the bar , laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins , Fred and George , who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts ; the newly elected Head Boy , Percy ; and the Weasleys ' youngest child and only girl , Ginny . 
Percy , however , held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said , " Harry . 
How nice to see you . " " Hello , Percy , " said Harry , trying not to laugh . 
" I hope you ' re well ? " said Percy pompously , shaking hands . 
" Very well , thanks — " " Harry ! " said Fred , elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply . 
" Absolutely spiffing . " 
" That's enough , now , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" How really corking to see you — " " I said , that's enough , " said Mrs . Weasley , depositing her shopping in an empty chair . 
" Hello , Harry , dear . 
She pointed to the brand - new silver badge on Percy's chest . 
" I don't doubt that , " said Mrs . Weasley , frowning suddenly . 
" Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example , Mother , " said Percy loftily . 
" I'm going up to change for dinner … " He disappeared and George heaved a sigh . 
" We tried to shut him in a pyramid , " he told Harry . 
" But Mum spotted us . " 
Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor , and the seven Weasleys , Harry , and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses . 
Everyone looked up at him . 
" Why ? " said Percy curiously . 
" And there ' ll be little flags on the hoods , with HB on them — " " — for Humongous Bighead , " said Fred . 
" Well , as we haven't got one anymore , " said Mr . Weasley , " and as I work there , they ' re doing me a favor … " His voice was casual , but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr . Wesley's ears had gone red , just like Ron's did when he was under pressure . 
" Good thing , too , " said Mrs . Weasley briskly . 
" Do you realize how much luggage you ' ve all got between you ? 
" He's dumped them on my bed . " " You'd better go and pack properly , Ron , because we won't have much time in the morning , " Mrs . Weasley called down the table . 
Ron scowled at Percy . 
After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy . 
One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day . 
Ron and Percy were next door to Harry . 
He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall , and went to see what was going on . 
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting . 
Ron roared back . 
" What's up ? " said Harry . 
" I ' ll get Scabbers's stuff , I'm packed , " Harry said to Ron , and he went downstairs . 
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar , which was now very dark , when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor . 
He hesitated , not wanting them to know he'd heard them arguing , when the sound of his own name made him stop , then move closer to the parlor door . 
" Harry's got a right to know . 
I ' ve tried to tell Fudge , but he insists on treating Harry like a child . 
" Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him ? 
For heaven's sake , he's happy not knowing ! " 
" I don't want to make him miserable , I want to put him on his guard ! " retorted Mr . Weasley . 
" You know what Harry and Ron are like , wandering off by themselves — they ' ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest ! 
But Harry mustn't do that this year ! 
When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home ! 
" But he's not dead , he's fine , so what's the point — " " Molly , they say Sirius Black's mad , and maybe he is , but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban , and that's supposed to be impossible . 
The only thing we know for sure is what Black's after — " " But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts . " 
" But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry — " There was a thud on wood , and Harry was sure Mr . Weasley had banged his fist on the table . 
" Molly , how many times do I have to tell you ? 
They didn't report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet , but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped . 
Always the same words : ' He's at Hogwarts … he's at Hogwarts . ' Black is deranged , Molly , and he wants Harry dead . 
If you ask me , he thinks murdering Harry will bring You - Know - Who back to power . 
Harry leaned still closer to the door , desperate to hear more . 
" Well , Arthur , you must do what you think is right . 
But you ' re forgetting Albus Dumbledore . 
I suppose he knows about all this ? " " Of course he knows . 
We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds . 
" Not happy ? 
" Nor am I , if it comes to that … but when you ' re dealing with a wizard like Black , you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather avoid . " 
As quietly as he could , he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight . 
The parlor door opened , and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr . and Mrs . Weasley were climbing the stairs . 
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier . 
Harry waited until he heard Mr . and Mrs . Wesley's bedroom door close , then headed back upstairs with the bottle . 
Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing , heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's room in search of his badge . 
" We ' ve got it , " Fred whispered to Harry . 
Harry forced a laugh , went to give Ron the rat tonic , then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed . 
So Sirius Black was after him . 
Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive . 
He'd made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him . 
And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow , so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train . 
Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse ; Mr . and Mrs . Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic - stricken if he knew the truth . 
But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs . Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be . 
Didn't people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of ? 
And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about . 
No , all in all , the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero . 
Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught ; in fact , Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed . 
He scowled at the dark ceiling . 
He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times ; he wasn't completely useless … Unbidden , the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind . 
What to do when you know the worst is coming … " I'm not going to be murdered , " Harry said out loud . 
Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea . 
Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room , pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable . 
" The sooner we get on the train , the better , " he said . 
You know , " Ron grimaced , " his girlfriend . 
They headed down to breakfast , where Mr . Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs . Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl . 
" What were you saying ? " 
Ron asked Harry as they sat down . 
Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving ; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's narrow staircase and piling them up near the door , with Hedwig and Hermes , Percy's screech owl , perched on top in their cages . 
" It's all right , Crookshanks , " Hermione cooed through the wickerwork . 
" I ' ll let you out on the train . " 
" What about poor Scabbers , eh ? " 
He pointed at his chest , where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket . 
Mr . Weasley , who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars , stuck his head inside . 
" Harry , come on . " 
Mr . Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two oldfashioned dark green cars , each of which was driven by a furtive - looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet . 
Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione , Ron , and , to Ron's disgust , Percy . 
The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's trip on the Knight Bus . 
though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed . 
They reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare ; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys , unloaded their trunks , touched their hats in salute to Mr . Weasley , and drove away , somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights . 
Mr . Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station . 
" Right then , " he said , glancing around them . 
Mr . Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten , pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine . 
With a meaningful look at Harry , he leaned casually against the barrier . 
Harry imitated him . 
In a moment , they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and threequarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express , a scarlet steam engine , puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train . 
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry . 
Ginny caught Harry's eye , and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long , curly hair , walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge . 
Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them , Harry and Mr . Weasley led the way to the end of the train , past packed compartments , to a carriage that looked quite empty . 
They loaded the trunks onto it , stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage rack , then went back outside to say goodbye to Mr . and Mrs . Weasley . 
Mrs . Weasley kissed all her children , then Hermione , and finally Harry . 
Here you are , Ron … no , they ' re not corned beef … Fred ? 
Where's Fred ? 
" There's something I ' ve got to tell you before you leave — " said Mr . Weasley in a tense voice . 
" It's all right , Mr . Weasley , " said Harry , " I already know . " 
" You know ? 
How could you know ? " " I — er — I heard you and Mrs . Wesley talking last night . 
" Harry , you must be scared — " " I'm not , " said Harry sincerely . 
Mr . Weasley flinched at the sound of the name , but overlooked it . 
" Harry , I knew you were , well , made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems to think , and I'm obviously pleased that you ' re not scared , but — " " Arthur ! " called Mrs . Weasley , who was now shepherding the rest onto the train . 
" Arthur , what are you doing ? 
It's about to go ! " " He's coming Molly ! " said Mr . Weasley , but he turned back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice , " Listen , I want you to give me your word — " " — that I ' ll be a good boy and stay in the castle ? " said Harry gloomily . 
" Harry , swear to me you won't go looking for Black . " 
Harry stared , " What ! " 
There was a loud whistle . 
Guards were walking along the train , slamming all the doors shut . 
" Promise me , Harry , " said Mr . Weasley , talking more quickly still , " that whatever happens — " " Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me ? " said Harry blankly . 
" Swear to me that whatever you might hear — " " Arthur , quickly ! " cried Mrs . Weasley . 
Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron threw it open and stood back to let him on . 
They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr . and Mrs . Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view . 
" I need to talk to you in private , " Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed . 
" Go away , Ginny , " said Ron . " Oh , that's nice , " said Ginny huffily , and she stalked off . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione set off down the corridor , looking for an empty compartment , but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione checked on the threshold . 
The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before , except for the witch who pushed the food cart . 
He looked ill and exhausted . 
Though quite young , his light brown hair was flecked with gray . 
" Who d ' you reckon he is ? " Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut , taking the seats farthest away from the window . 
" Professor R . J . Lupin . " 
whispered Hermione at once . 
" That's obvious , " whispered Hermione . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , both of whom had lasted only one year . 
When he'd finished , Ron looked thunderstruck , and Hermione had her hands over her mouth . 
She finally lowered them to say , " Sirius Black escaped to come after you ? 
Oh , Harry … you ' ll have to be really , really careful . 
" How thick would Harry have to be , to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him ? " said Ron shakily . 
Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was . 
" No one's ever done it before . 
" But they ' ll catch him , won't they ? " said Hermione earnestly . 
They looked all around the compartment . 
" It's coming from your trunk , Harry , " said Ron , standing up and reaching into the luggage rack . 
It was spinning very fast in the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly . 
" Yeah … mind you , it's a very cheap one , " Ron said . 
" It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry . " " Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time ? " said Hermione shrewdly . 
You know he's not really up to long journeys … but how else was I supposed to get Harry's present to him ? " " Stick it back in the trunk , " Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly , " or it ' ll wake him up . " 
Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks , which deadened the sound , then closed the lid of the trunk on it . 
asked Hermione keenly . 
" but that's not why I want to go . 
I just want to get inside Honeydukes ! " " What's that ? " said Hermione . 
" It's this sweetshop , " said Ron , a dreamy look coming over his face , " where they ' ve got everything … Pepper Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream , and really excellent sugar quills , which you can suck in class and just look like you ' re thinking what to write next – " " But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place , isn't it ? " 
Hermione pressed on eagerly . 
" In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion , and the Shrieking Shack's supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — " " – and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you ' re sucking them , " said Ron , who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying . 
Hermione looked around at Harry . 
" ' Spect it will , " said Harry heavily . 
" You ' ll have to tell me when you ' ve found out . " " What d ' you mean ? " said Ron . " I can't go . 
Ron looked horrified . 
" You ' re not allowed to come ? 
But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — " Harry gave a hollow laugh . 
Professor McGonagall , head of Gryffindor house , was very strict . 
" – or we can ask Fred and George , they know every secret passage out of the castle — " " Ron ! " said Hermione sharply . 
" I don't think Harry should be sneaking out of the school with Black on the loose — " " Yeah , I expect that's what McGonagall will say when I ask of permission , " said Harry bitterly . 
" But if we ' re with him , " said Ron spiritedly to Hermione . 
" Don't let that thing out ! " Ron said , but too late ; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket , stretched , yawned , and sprang onto Ron's knees ; the lump in Ron's pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away . 
" Get out of it ! " 
" Ron , don't ! " said Hermione angrily . 
They watched him apprehensively , but he simply turned his head the other way , mouth slightly open , and slept on . 
The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened overhead . 
Crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat , his squashed face turned towards Ron , his yellow eyes on Ron's top pocket . 
At one o ' clock the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door . 
" D ' you think we should wake him up ? " Ron asked awkwardly , nodding towards Professor Lupin . 
" Er — Professor ? " 
she said . 
" Excuse me — Professor ? " 
" If he's hungry when he wakes , I ' ll be up front with the driver . " 
" I suppose he is asleep ? " said Ron quietly , as the witch slid the compartment door closed . 
" I mean — he hasn't died , has he ? " " No , no , he's breathing , " whispered Hermione , taking the cauldron cake Harry passed her . 
Mid - afternoon , just as it had started to rain , blurring the rolling hills outside the window , they heard footsteps outside in the corridor again , and their three least favorite people appeared at the door : Draco Malfoy , flanked by his cronies , Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle . 
Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first journey to Hogwarts . 
Malfoy , who had a pale , pointed , sneering face , was in Slytherin house ; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team , the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team . 
Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy's bidding . 
" Potty and the Weasel . " 
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly . 
Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor . 
Professor Lupin gave a snort . 
" What were you saying , Malfoy ? " Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed ; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher's nose . 
" C ' mon , " he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle , and they disappeared . 
Harry and Ron sat down again , Ron massaging his knuckles . 
" I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year , " he said angrily . 
" I mean it . 
The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north ; the windows were now a solid , shimmering gray , which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks . 
The train rattled , the rain hammered , the wind roared , but still , Professor Lupin slept . 
" We must be nearly there , " said Ron , leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window . 
" I'm starving . 
I want to get to the feast … " " We can't be there yet , " said Hermione , checking her watch . 
As the noise of the pistons fell away , the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows . 
Harry , who was nearest the door , got up to look into the corridor . 
" What's going on ? " said Ron's voice from behind Harry . 
" Ouch ! " gasped Hermione . 
Harry felt his way back to his seat . 
" D ' you think we ' ve broken down ? " " Dunno … " There was a squeaking sound , and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron , wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out . 
" There's something moving out there , " Ron said . 
" I think people are coming aboard … " The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry's legs . 
" Sorry ! 
D ' you know what's going on ? 
Ouch ! Sorry — " " Hullo , Neville , " said Harry , feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak . 
" Harry ? 
Is that you ? 
What's happening ? " 
" No idea ! 
" I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on , " came Hermione's voice . 
" Who's that ? " " Who's that ? " " Ginny ? " " Hermione ? " 
" What are you doing ? " " I was looking for Ron — " " Come in and sit down — " " Not here ! " said Harry hurriedly . 
" I'm here ! " 
" Ouch ! " said Neville . 
" Quiet ! " said a hoarse voice suddenly . 
Harry could hear movements in his corner . 
None of them spoke . 
There was a soft , crackling noise , and a shivering light filled the compartment . 
They illuminated his tired , gray face , but his eyes looked alert and wary . 
" Stay where you are . " he said in the same hoarse voice , and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him . 
But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it . 
Standing in the doorway , illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's hand , was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling . 
Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood . 
There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening , grayish , slimy - looking , and scabbed , like something dead that had decayed in water … But it was visible only for a split second . 
As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze , the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak . 
And then the thing beneath the hood , whatever it was , drew a long , slow , rattling breath , as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings . 
Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest . 
It was inside his chest , it was inside his very heart … Harry's eyes rolled up into his head . 
There was a rushing in his ears as though of water . 
He was being dragged downward , the roaring growing louder … And then , from far away , he heard screaming , terrible , terrified , pleading screams . 
He wanted to help whoever it was , he tried to move his arms , but couldn't … a thick white fog was swirling around him , inside him — " Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Are you all right ? " 
Someone was slapping his face . 
" W - what ? " 
Harry opened his eyes ; there were lanterns above him , and the floor was shaking — the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on . 
He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor . 
Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him , and above them he could see Neville and Professor Lupin watching . 
Harry felt very sick ; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on , he felt cold sweat on his face . 
Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat . 
" Are you okay ? " Ron asked nervously . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , looking quickly toward the door . 
" What happened ? 
Where's that — that thing ? 
Who screamed ? " 
" No one screamed , " said Ron , more nervously still . 
Harry looked around the bright compartment . 
Ginny and Neville looked back at him , both very pale . 
" But I heard screaming — " A loud snap made them all jump . 
" Here , " he said to Harry , handing him a particularly large piece . 
" Eat it . 
It ' ll help . " 
Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it . 
" One of the Dementors of Azkaban . " 
Everyone stared at him . 
Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket . 
" Eat , " he repeated . 
" It ' ll help . 
I need to speak to the driver , excuse me … " He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor . 
" Are you sure you ' re okay , Harry ? " said Hermione , watching Harry anxiously . 
" Well — that thing — the Dementor — stood there and looked around ( I mean , I think it did , I couldn't see its face ) — and you — you — " " I thought you were having a fit or something , " said Ron , who still looked scared . 
" You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching — " " And Professor Lupin stepped over you , and walked toward the Dementor , and pulled out his wand , " said Hermione , " and he said , ' None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks . 
Go . ' 
But the Dementor didn't move , so Lupin muttered something , and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it , and it turned around and sort of glided away … " " It was horrible , " said Neville , in a higher voice than usual . 
" No , " said Ron , looking anxiously at Harry again . 
Harry didn't understand . 
He paused as he entered , looked around , and said , with a small smile , " I haven't poisoned that chocolate , you know … " Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes . 
" We ' ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes , " said Professor Lupin . 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " 
Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name . 
They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey . 
At long last , the train stopped at Hogsmeade station , and there was a great scramble to get outside ; owls hooted , cats meowed , and Neville's pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform , beckoning the terrified - looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake . 
" All right , you three ? " Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd . 
They waved at him , but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track , where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students , each pulled , Harry could only assume , by an invisible horse , because when they climbed inside and shut the door , the coach set off all by itself , bumping and swaying in procession . 
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw . 
Harry felt better since the chocolate , but still weak . 
Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways , as though frightened he might collapse again . 
As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates , flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars , Harry saw two more towering , hooded Dementors , standing guard on either side . 
A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again ; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates . 
The carriage picked up speed on the long , sloping drive up to the castle ; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window , watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer . 
At last , the carriage swayed to a halt , and Hermione and Ron got out . 
As Harry stepped down , a drawling , delighted voice sounded in his ear . 
Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to the castle , his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously . 
" Shove off , Malfoy , " said Ron , whose jaw was clenched . 
" Did you faint as well , Weasley ? " said Malfoy loudly . 
Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare , which took in the patches on his robes and the dilapidated suitcase . 
With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice , he said , " Oh , no — er — Professor , " then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle . 
Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry , and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps , through the giant oak front doors , into the cavernous Entrance Hall , which was lit with flaming torches , and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors . 
The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right ; Harry followed the crowd toward it , but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling , which was black and cloudy tonight , when a voice called , " Potter ! 
I want to see you both ! " Harry and Hermione turned around , surprised . 
Professor McGonagall , Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House , was calling over the heads of the crowd . 
She was a stern looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun ; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles . 
Harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding : Professor McGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong . 
Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd ; they accompanied her across the entrance hall , up the marble staircase , and along a corridor . 
Once they were in her office , a small room with a large , welcoming fire , Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down . 
Before Harry could reply , there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , came bustling in . 
Harry felt himself going red in the face . 
" I'm fine , " he said , " I don't need anything — " " Oh , it's you , is it ? " said Madam Pomfrey , ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him . 
" I suppose you ' ve been doing something dangerous again ? " " It was a Dementor , Poppy , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Of course you ' re not , " said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly , now taking his pulse . 
" What does he need ? " said Professor McGonagall crisply . 
Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing ? " " I'm fine ! " said Harry , jumping up . 
The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture . 
" Well , he should have some chocolate , at the very least , " said Madam Pomfrey , who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes . 
" I ' ve already had some , " said Harry . 
" Professor Lupin gave me some . 
" Are you sure you feel all right , Potter ? " Professor McGonagall said sharply . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Very well . 
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey , who left for the hospital wing , muttering to herself . 
He had to wait only a few minutes ; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something , followed by Professor McGonagall , and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall . 
It was a sea of pointed black hats ; each of the long House tables was lined with students , their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles , which were floating over the tables in midair . 
Professor Flitwick , who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair , was carrying an ancient hat and a three - legged stool out of the hall . 
" Oh , " said Hermione softly , " we ' ve missed the Sorting ! " New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting Hat , which shouted out the House they were best suited to ( Gryffindor , Ravenclaw , Hufflepuff , or Slytherin ) . 
Professor McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table , and Harry and Hermione set off in the other direction , as quietly as possible , toward the Gryffindor table . 
People looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall , and a few of them pointed at Harry . 
Had the story of his collapsing in front of the Dementor traveled that fast ? 
He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron , who had saved them seats . 
Harry started to explain in a whisper , but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak , and he broke off . 
Professor Dumbledore , though very old , always gave an impression of great energy . 
He was often described as the greatest wizard of the age , but that wasn't why Harry respected him . 
You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore , and as Harry watched him beaming around at the students , he felt really calm for the first time since the Dementor had entered the train compartment . 
" Welcome ! " said Dumbledore , the candlelight shimmering on his beard . 
" Welcome to another year at Hogwarts ! 
I have a few things to say to you all , and as one of them is very serious , I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast … " Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued , " As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express , our school is presently playing host to some of the Dementors of Azkaban , who are here on Ministry of Magic business . " 
He paused , and Harry remembered what Mr . Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the Dementors guarding the school . 
Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks , " he added blandly , and Harry and Ron glanced at each other . 
" It is not in the nature of a Dementor to understand pleading or excuses . 
I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you . 
I look to the prefects , and our new Head Boy and Girl , to make sure that no student runs afoul of the Dementors , " he said . 
Percy , who was sitting a few seats down from Harry , puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively . 
" On a happier note , " he continued , " I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year . 
" First , Professor Lupin , who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . " 
Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes . 
" Look at Snape ! " Ron hissed in Harry's ear . 
Professor Snape , the Potions master , was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin . 
It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , but even Harry , who hated Snape , was startled at the expression twisting his thin , sallow face . it was beyond anger : it was loathing . 
Harry knew that expression only too well ; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry . 
" Well , I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn , our Care of Magical Creatures teacher , retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs . 
However , I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid , who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties . " 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stared at one another , stunned . 
Then they joined in with the applause , which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in particular . 
Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid , who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands , his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard . 
" Who else would have assigned us a biting book ? " Harry , Ron , and Hermione were the last to stop clapping , and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again , they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth . 
The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink . 
Harry , suddenly ravenous , helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat . 
It was a delicious feast ; the hall echoed with talk , laughter , and the clatter of knives and forks . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione , however , were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid . 
Hagrid wasn't a fully qualified wizard ; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed . 
It had been Harry , Ron , and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid's name last year . 
At long last , when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters , Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed , and they got their chance . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and , very tired now , along more corridors , up more and more stairs , to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower , where a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them , " Password ? " 
Through the portrait hole and across the common room , the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases . 
Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back . 
When Harry , Ron , and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day , the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy , who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story . 
As they passed , Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter . 
" Ignore him , " said Hermione , who was right behind Harry . 
" Just ignore him , it's not worth it … " " Hey , Potter ! " shrieked Pansy Parkinson , a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug . 
" Potter ! 
Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table , next to George Weasley . 
" What's up with you , Harry ? " " Malfoy , " said Ron , sitting down on George's other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table . 
George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror again . 
" That little git , " he said calmly . 
" He wasn't so cocky last night when the Dementors were down at our end of the train . 
Came running into our compartment , didn't he , Fred ? " " Nearly wet himself , " said Fred , with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy . 
" Forget it , Harry , " said George bracingly . 
" Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time , remember , Fred ? 
And he said it was the worst place he'd ever been , he came back all weak and shaking … They suck the happiness out of a place , Dementors . 
Most of the prisoners go mad in there . " 
" Anyway , we ' ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match , " said Fred . " Gryffindor versus Slytherin , first game of the season , remember ? " 
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match , Malfoy had definitely come off worse . 
Hermione was examining her new schedule . 
Look — they ' ve got you down for about ten subjects a day . 
" I ' ll manage . 
And — " Ron leaned closer to the timetable , disbelieving , " look — underneath that , Arithmancy , nine o ' clock . 
I mean , I know you ' re good , Hermione , but no one's that good . 
" Of course I won't be in three classes at once . " " Well then — " " Pass the marmalade , " said Hermione . 
" But — " " Oh , Ron , what's it to you if my timetable's a bit full ? " Hermione snapped . 
" I told you , I ' ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall . " 
Just then , Hagrid entered the Great Hall . 
Right after lunch ! 
Bin up since five getting ' everthin ' ready … hope it'sokay … me , a teacher … hones ' ly … " He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table , still swinging the polecat . 
" Wonder what he's been getting ready ? " said Ron , a note of anxiety in his voice . 
Ron checked his schedule . 
" We'd better go , look , Divination's at the top of North Tower . 
It ' ll take us ten minutes to get there … " They finished breakfast hastily , said goodbye to Fred and George and walked back through the hall . 
As they passed the Slytherin table , Malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit . 
The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one . 
Two years at Hogwarts hadn't taught them everything about the castle , and they had never been inside North Tower before . 
" There's — got — to — be — a — short — cut , " Ron panted , as they climbed the seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing , where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall . 
" I think it's this way , " said Hermione , peering down the empty passage to the right . 
" Can't be , " said Ron . " That's south . 
Look , you can see a bit of the lake outside the window … " 
Harry was watching the painting . 
Harry was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other , but he always enjoyed watching them . 
By the look of the grass stains on his metal knees , he had just fallen off . 
" Aha ! " he yelled , seeing Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Draw , you knaves , you dogs ! " 
They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently , hopping up and down in rage . 
" Are you all right ? " said Harry , moving closer to the picture . 
Back , you rogue ! " 
The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up , but the blade sank deeply into the grass and , though he pulled with all his might , he couldn't get it out again . 
Finally , he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face . 
" Listen , " said Harry , taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion , " we ' re looking for the North Tower . 
You don't know the way , do you ? " 
" A quest ! " 
The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly . 
He gave the sword another fruitless tug , tried and failed to mount the fat pony , gave up , and cried , " On foot then , good sirs and gentle lady ! 
On ! On ! " And he ran , clanking loudly , into the left side of the frame and out of sight . 
They hurried after him along the corridor , following the sound of his armor . 
Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead . 
" Be of stout heart , the worst is yet to come ! " yelled the knight , and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines , whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase . 
Puffing loudly , Harry , Ron , and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps , getting dizzier and dizzier , until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom . 
" Farewell ! " cried the knight , popping his head into a painting of some sinister - looking monks . 
They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing , where most of the class was already assembled . 
" ' Sybill Trelawney , Divination teacher , ' " Harry read . 
" How ' re we supposed to get up there ? " 
As though in answer to his question , the trapdoor suddenly opened , and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet . 
In fact , it didn't look like a classroom at all , more like a cross between someone's attic and an old - fashioned tea shop . 
Everything was lit with a dim , crimson light ; the curtains at the windows were all closed , and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves . 
It was stiflingly warm , and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy , sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle . 
The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty - looking feathers , stubs of candles , many packs of tattered playing cards , countless silvery crystal balls , and a huge array of teacups . 
" Where is she ? " Ron said . 
A voice came suddenly out of the shadows , a soft , misty sort of voice . 
Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight , and they saw that she was very thin ; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size , and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl . 
Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck , and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table . 
" Welcome to Divination , " said Professor Trelawney , who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire . 
" My name is Professor Trelawney . 
You may not have seen me before . 
I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye . " Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement . 
Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued , " So you have chosen to study Divination , the most difficult of all magical arts . 
I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight , there is very little I will be able to teach you … Books can take you only so far in this field … " At these words , both Harry and Ron glanced , grinning , at Hermione , who looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this subject . 
" Many witches and wizards , talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings , are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future , " Professor Trelawney went on , her enormous , gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face . 
" It is a Gift granted to few . 
" I wouldn't be so sure if I were you , dear , " said Professor Trelawney , the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings . 
Neville gulped . 
Professor Trelawney continued placidly . 
" We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year . 
The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves . 
By the way , my dear , " she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil , " beware a red - haired man . " 
" In the second term , " Professor Trelawney went on , " we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens , that is . 
Unfortunately , classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu . 
I myself will lose my voice . 
And around Easter , one of our number will leave us for ever . " 
A very tense silence followed this pronouncement , but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it . 
Lavender , looking relieved , stood up , took an enormous teapot from the shelf , and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney . 
" Thank you , my dear . 
Incidentally , that thing you are dreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October . " 
Lavender trembled . 
" Now , I want you all to divide into pairs . 
Collect a teacup from the shelf , come to me , and I will fill it . 
Then sit down and drink , drink until only the dregs remain . 
Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand , then turn the cup upside down on its saucer , wait for the last of the tea to drain away , then give your cup to your partner to read . 
You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future . 
Oh , and dear , " — she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up , " after you ' ve broken your first cup , would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones ? 
I'm rather attached to the pink . " 
Sure enough , Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china . 
Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said , " One of the blue ones , then , dear , if you wouldn't mind … thank you … " When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled , they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly . 
The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid . 
" Broaden your minds , my dears , and allow your eyes to see past the mundane ! " Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom . 
Harry tried to pull himself together . 
" That means you ' re going to have ' trials and suffering ' — sorry about that — but there's a thing that could be the sun . 
Hang on … that means ' great happiness ' … so you ' re going to suffer but be very happy … " " You need your Inner Eye tested , if you ask me , " said Ron , and they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction . 
" There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat , " he said . 
" Maybe you ' re going to work for the Ministry of Magic … " He turned the teacup the other way up . 
" But this way it looks more like an acorn … what's that ? " 
He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future . 
And there's a thing here , " he turned the cup again , " that looks like an animal … yeah , if that was its head … it looks like a hippo … no , a sheep … " Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter . 
" But everyone knows that , " said Hermione in a loud whisper . 
Professor Trelawney stared at her . " Well , they do , " said Hermione . 
" Everybody knows about Harry and You - Know - Who . " 
Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration . 
They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before . 
Professor Trelawney chose not to reply . 
She lowered her huge eyes to Harry's cup again and continued to turn it . 
" The club … an attack . 
Dear , dear , this is not a happy cup … " " I thought that was a bowler hat , " said Ron sheepishly . 
Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair , her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed . 
" My dear boy — my poor dear boy — no — it is kinder not to say — no — don't ask me … " " What is it , Professor ? " said Dean Thomas at once . 
Everyone had got to their feet , and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table , pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a good look at Harry's cup . 
" My dear , " Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically , " you have the Grim . " 
" The what ? " said Harry . 
That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts — the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent … Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too . 
Everyone was looking at Harry , everyone except Hermione , who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair . 
Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike . 
" You ' ll forgive me for saying so , my dear , but I perceive very little aura around you . 
Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future . " 
Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side . 
" It looks like a Grim if you do this , " he said , with his eyes almost shut , " but it looks more like a donkey from here , " he said , leaning to the left . 
Now nobody seemed to want to look at him . 
" I think we will leave the lesson here for today , " said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice . 
Even Ron was avoiding Harry's eyes . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the winding stair in silence , then set off for Professor McGonagall's Transfiguration lesson . 
Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room , feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight ; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him , as though he were about to drop dead at any moment . 
He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi ( wizards who could transform at will into animals ) , and wasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes . 
" Not that it matters , but that's the first time my transformation's not got applause from a class . " 
Then Hermione raised her hand . 
" Please , Professor , we ' ve just had our first Divination class , and we were reading the tea leaves , and — " " Ah , of course , " said Professor McGonagall , suddenly frowning . 
" There is no need to say any more , Miss Granger . 
Everyone stared at her . " Me , " said Harry , finally . 
" I see , " said Professor McGonagall , fixing Harry with her beady eyes . 
" Then you should know , Potter , that Sybill Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school . 
None of them has died yet . 
She went on , more calmly , " Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic . 
I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it . 
I assure you that if you die , you need not hand it in . " 
Hermione laughed . 
Harry felt a bit better . 
It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom . 
Ron still looked worried , and Lavender whispered , " But what about Neville's cup ? " 
When the Transfiguration class had finished , they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch . 
" Ron , cheer up , " said Hermione , pushing a dish of stew toward him . 
" You heard what Professor McGonagall said . " 
Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start . 
" Harry , " he said , in a low , serious voice , " You haven't seen a great black dog anywhere , have you ? " 
" Yeah , I have , " said Harry . 
" I saw one the night I left the Dursleys ' . " 
" Probably a stray , " said Hermione calmly . 
Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad . 
" Hermione , if Harry's seen a Grim , that's — that's bad , " he said . 
" My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and he died twenty - four hours later ! " " Coincidence , " said Hermione airily , pouring herself some pumpkin juice . 
" You don't know what you ' re talking about ! " said Ron , starting to get angry . 
" They see the Grim and die of fright . 
The Grim's not an omen , it's the cause of death ! 
And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think , right , well , I'd better kick the bucket then ! " Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione , who opened her bag , took out her new Arithmancy book , and propped it open against the juice jug . 
" A lot of guesswork , if you ask me . " " There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup ! " said Ron hotly . 
" Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura ! 
" If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves , I'm not sure I ' ll be studying it much longer ! 
That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class ! " 
She snatched up her bag and stalked away . 
Ron frowned after her . 
" What's she talking about ? " he said to Harry . 
Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch . 
Yesterday's rain had cleared ; the sky was a clear , pale gray , and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical Creatures class . 
Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other . 
Harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle , who were chortling . 
Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about . 
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut . 
He stood in his moleskin overcoat , with Fang the boarhound at his heels , looking impatient to start . 
Right , follow me ! " 
For one nasty moment , Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest ; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime . 
However , Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees , and five minutes later , they found themselves outside a kind of paddock . 
There was nothing in there . 
" Eh ? " said Hagrid . 
" How do we open our books ? " 
Malfoy repeated . 
He took out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters , which he had bound shut with a length of rope . 
The class all shook their heads . 
" Yeh ' ve got ter stroke ' em , " said Hagrid , as though this was the most obvious thing in the world . 
The book tried to bite , but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine , and the book shivered , and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand . 
" We should have stroked them ! 
" Oh , tremendously funny ! " said Malfoy . 
Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success . 
Yeah . 
Hang on … " He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight . 
" God , this place is going to the dogs , " said Malfoy loudly . 
squealed Lavender Brown , pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock . 
They had the bodies , hind legs , and tails of horses , but the front legs , wings , and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles , with cruel , steel - colored beaks and large , brilliantly , orange eyes . 
Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck , which was attached to a long chain , and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid , who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures . 
" Gee up , there ! " he roared , shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood . 
Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence . 
Hagrid roared happily , waving a hand at them . 
Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse , half bird , you started to appreciate the Hippogriffs ' gleaming coats , changing smoothly from feather to hair , each of them a different color : stormy gray , bronze , pinkish roan , gleaming chestnut , and inky black . 
" So , " said Hagrid , rubbing his hands together and beaming around , " if yeh wan'ter come a bit nearer … " No one seemed to want to . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione , however , approached the fence cautiously . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle weren't listening ; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson . 
" It's polite , see ? 
Even Harry , Ron , and Hermione had misgivings . 
" No one ? " said Hagrid , with a pleading look . 
" I ' ll do it , " said Harry . 
There was an intake of breath from behind him , and both Lavender and Parvati whispered , " Oooh , no , Harry , remember your tea leaves ! " 
Harry ignored them . 
He climbed over the paddock fence . 
" Good man , Harry ! " roared Hagrid . 
He untied one of the chains , pulled the gray Hippogriff away from its fellows , and slipped off its leather collar . 
The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath . 
Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously . 
" Easy now , Harry , " said Hagrid quietly . 
Buckbeak had turned his great , sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye . 
" Tha's it , " said Hagrid . 
" Tha's it , Harry … now , bow . " 
Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak , but he did as he was told . 
He gave a short bow and then looked up . 
The Hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him . 
It didn't move . 
" Ah , " said Hagrid , sounding worried . 
" Well done , Harry ! " said Hagrid , ecstatic . 
He patted the beak several times and the Hippogriff closed its eyes lazily , as though enjoying it . 
The class broke into applause , all except for Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , who were looking deeply disappointed . 
" Righ ' then , Harry , " said Hagrid . 
He was used to a broomstick ; but he wasn't sure a Hippogriff would be quite the same . 
" Yeh climb up there , jus ' behind the wing joint , " said Hagrid , " an ' mind yeh don ' pull any of his feathers out , he won ' like that … " Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak's wing and hoisted himself onto its back . 
Buckbeak stood up . 
Harry wasn't sure where to hold on ; everything in front of him was covered with feathers . 
" Go on , then ! " roared Hagrid , slapping the Hippogriffs hindquarters . 
Without warning , twelve - foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry , he just had time to seize the Hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward . 
It was nothing like a broomstick , and Harry knew which one he preferred ; the Hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him , catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off ; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn't dare get a stronger grip ; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand , he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the Hippogriff rose and fell with its wings . 
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground ; this was the bit Harry had been dreading ; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered , feeling he was going to slip off over the beak , then felt a heavy thud as the four ill - assorted feet hit the ground . 
" Good work , Harry ! " roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle cheered . 
" Okay , who else wants a go ? " Emboldened by Harry's success , the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock . 
Hagrid untied the Hippogriffs one by one , and soon people were bowing nervously , all over the paddock . 
Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut , while Harry watched . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak . 
He had bowed to Malfoy , who was now patting his beak , looking disdainful . 
" This is very easy , " Malfoy drawled , loud enough for Harry to , hear him . 
" I knew it must have been , if Potter could do it … I bet you ' re not dangerous at all , are you ? " he said to the Hippogriff . 
" Are you , you great ugly brute ? " 
" I'm dying , look at me ! It's killed me ! " " Yer not dyin ' ! " said Hagrid , who had gone very white . 
" Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — " Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily . 
As they passed , Harry saw that there was a long , deep gash on Malfoy's arm ; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him , up the slope toward the castle . 
The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid . 
" It was Malfoy's fault ! " snapped Dean Thomas . 
Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly . 
They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall . 
" I'm going to see if he's okay ! " said Pansy , and they all watched her run up the marble staircase . 
The Slytherins , still muttering about Hagrid , headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room ; Harry , Ron , and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower . 
" Course he will . 
" Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him … " They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime , hoping to see Hagrid , but he wasn't there . 
Harry was watching the Slytherin table . 
A large group including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together , deep in conversation . 
They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them , but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window . 
" There's a light on in Hagrid's window , " Harry said suddenly . 
Ron looked at his watch . 
" If we hurried , we could go down and see him . 
It's still quite early … " " I don't know , " Hermione said slowly , and Harry saw her glance at him . 
" I'm allowed to walk across the grounds , " he said pointedly . 
So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole , glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors , as they weren't entirely sure they were supposed to be out . 
The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight . 
Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table ; his boarhound , Fang , had his head in Hagrid's lap . 
" ' Spect it's a record , " he said thickly , when he recognized them . 
" You haven't been fired , Hagrid ! " gasped Hermione . 
" It wasn't serious , was it ? " 
" Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could , " said Hagrid dully , " but he's sayin ' it's still agony … covered in bandages … moanin ' … " " He's faking it , " said Harry at once . 
Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's worth . " 
Shoulda left Hippogriffs fer later … one flobberworms or summat … Jus ' thought it'd make a good firs ' lesson's all my fault … " " It's all Malfoy's fault , Hagrid ! " said Hermione earnestly . 
" We're witnesses , " said Harry . 
It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening . 
We ' ll tell Dumbledore what really happened . " 
He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone - breaking hug . 
" I think you ' ve had enough to drink , Hagrid , " said Hermione firmly . 
She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it . 
" Ah , maybe she's right , " said Hagrid , letting go of Harry and Ron , who both staggered away , rubbing their ribs . 
" What's he done ? " said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard . 
" Stuck his head in the water barrel , " said Hermione , putting the tankard away . 
Hagrid came back , his long hair and beard sopping wet , wiping the water out of his eyes . 
AN , YOU TWO ! LETTIN ' HIM ! " Hagrid strode over to Harry , grabbed his arm , and pulled him to the door . 
Hagrid said angrily . 
I'm not worth that ! " 
He swaggered into the dungeon , his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling , acting , in Harry's opinion , as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle . 
" How is it , Draco ? " simpered Pansy Parkinson . 
But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away . 
" Settle down , settle down , " said Professor Snape idly . 
Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron , so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table . 
" Sir , " Malfoy called , " sir , I ' ll need help cutting up these daisy roots , because of my arm — " " Weasley , cut up Malfoy's roots for him , " said Snape without looking up . 
Ron went brick red . 
" There's nothing wrong with your arm , " he hissed at Malfoy . 
Malfoy smirked across the table . 
" Weasley , you heard Professor Snape ; cut up these roots . " 
Ron seized his knife , pulled Malfoy's roots toward him , and began to chop them roughly , so that they were all different sizes . 
Snape approached their table , stared down his hooked nose at the roots , then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long , greasy black hair . 
" Now , " said Snape in his most dangerous voice . 
Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy , then took up the knife again . 
" Potter , you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig , " said Snape , giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him . 
Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use . 
Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking . 
Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever . 
" Seen your pal Hagrid lately ? " he asked them quietly . 
" I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer , " said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow . 
" – he's complained to the school governors . 
And to the Ministry of Magic . 
" Well , " said Malfoy , lowering his voice to a whisper , " partly , Potter . 
But there are other benefits too . 
A few cauldrons away , Neville was in trouble . 
Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons ; it was his worst subject , and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse . 
" Orange . 
What do I have to do to make you understand , Longbottom ? " Neville was pink and trembling . 
He looked as though he was on the verge of tears . 
" I don't remember asking you to show off , Miss Granger , " said Snape coldly , and Hermione went as pink as Neville . 
" Longbottom , at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens . 
Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly . " 
" Help me ! " he moaned to Hermione . 
" Hey , Harry , " said Seamus Finnigan , leaning over to borrow Harry's brass scales , " have you heard ? 
Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black's been sighted . " 
" Where ? " said Harry and Ron quickly . 
On the other side of the table , Malfoy looked up , listening closely . 
" Not too far from here , " said Seamus , who looked excited . 
" It was a Muggle who saw him . 
So she phoned the telephone hot line . 
By the time the Ministry of Magic got there , he was gone . " 
" Not too far from here … " Ron repeated , looking significantly at Harry . 
He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely . 
" What , Malfoy ? 
But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently , and they were fixed Harry . 
He leaned across the table . 
" Thinking of trying to catch Black single - handed , Potter ? " " Yeah , that's right , " said Harry offhandedly . 
Malfoy's thin mouth was curving in a mean smile . 
I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy , I'd be out there looking for him . " 
" What are you talking about , Malfoy ? " said Ron roughly . 
" Don't you know , Potter ? " breathed Malfoy , his pale eyes narrowed . 
" Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck , " he said . 
" Want to leave it to the Dementors , do you ? 
But if it was me , I'd want revenge . 
I'd hunt him down myself . " 
Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth , so that Snape wouldn't see . 
Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner . 
" What did Malfoy mean ? " 
Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth " Why would I want revenge on Black ? 
" He's making it up , " said Ron savagely . 
" Everyone gather ' round , " said Snape , his black eyes glittering , " and watch what happens to Longbottom's toad . 
If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution , it will shrink to a tadpole . 
The Gryffindors watched fearfully . 
The Slytherins looked excited . 
Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville's potion , which was now green . 
He trickled a few drops down Trevor's throat . 
There was a moment of hushed silence , in which Trevor gulped ; then there was a small pop , and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape's palm . 
Snape , looking sour , pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe , poured a few drops on top of Trevor , and he reappeared suddenly , fully grown . 
" I told you not to help him , Miss Granger . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall . 
Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said , while Ron was seething about Snape . 
" Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right ! 
Why didn't you lie , Hermione ? 
Ron looked around . 
" Where is she ? " 
Harry turned too . 
They were at the top of the steps now , watching the rest of the class pass them , heading for the Great Hall and lunch . 
" She was right behind us , " said Ron , frowning . 
Malfoy passed them , walking between Crabbe and Goyle . 
He smirked at Harry and disappeared . 
" There she is , " said Harry . 
Hermione was panting slightly , hurrying up the stairs ; one hand clutched her bag , the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes . 
" How did you do that ? " said Ron . " What ? " said Hermione , joining them . 
" One minute you were right behind us , the next moment , you were back at the bottom of the stairs again . " 
" What ? " 
Hermione looked slightly confused . 
" Oh — I had to go back for something . 
" Why are you carrying all these around with you ? " Ron asked her . 
" You know how many subjects I'm taking , " said Hermione breathlessly . 
It's only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon . " 
" Oh yes , " said Hermione vaguely , but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same . 
Ron asked Harry . 
They all sat down , took out their books , quills , and parchment , and were talking when he finally entered the room . 
Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher's desk . 
He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train , as though he had had a few square meals . 
" Good afternoon , " he said . 
They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts class before , unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose . 
" Right then , " said Professor Lupin , when everyone was ready . 
Puzzled but interested , the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom . 
He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner , where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist , who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum . 
Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this ; to their surprise , he was still smiling . 
" I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you , Peeves , " he said pleasantly . 
" Mr . 
Filch won't be able to get in to his brooms . " 
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker , a bad - tempered , failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and , indeed , Peeves . 
However , Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words , except to blow a loud wet raspberry . 
" Please watch closely . " 
He raised the wand to shoulder height , said , " Waddiwasi ! " and pointed it at Peeves . 
With the force of a bullet , the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril ; he whirled upright and zoomed away , cursing . 
" Thank you , Dean , " said Professor Lupin , putting his wand away again . 
He led them down a second corridor and stopped , right outside the staffroom door . 
Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair , and he looked around as the class filed in . 
He got to his feet and strode past the class , his black robes billowing behind him . 
I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult . 
Harry glared at Snape ; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes , let alone doing it in front of other teachers . 
Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows . 
" I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation , " he said , " and I am sure he will perform it admirably . " 
Snape's lip curled , but he left , shutting the door with a snap . 
" Now , then , " said Professor Lupin , beckoning the class toward the end of the room , where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes . 
As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it , the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble , banging off the wall . 
" There's a Boggart in there . " 
This one moved in yesterday afternoon , and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice . 
" So , the first question we must ask ourselves is , what is a Boggart ? " Hermione put up her hand . 
" It's a shape - shifter , " she said . 
" It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most . " 
" So the Boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form . 
He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door . 
Nobody knows what a Boggart looks like when he is alone , but when I let him out , he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears . 
" This means , " said Professor Lupin , choosing to ignore Neville's small sputter of terror , " that we have a huge advantage over the Boggart before we begin . 
Have you spotted it , Harry ? " Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him , bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air , was very off - putting , but Harry had a go . 
I once saw a Boggart make that very mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug . 
What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing . 
" We will practice the charm without wands first . 
After me , please … Riddikulus ! " " Riddikulus ! " said the class together . 
" Good , " said Professor Lupin . 
" Very good . 
But that was the easy part , I'm afraid . 
You see , the word alone is not enough . 
And this is where you come in , Neville . " 
The wardrobe shook again , though not as much as Neville , who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows . 
" Right , Neville , " said Professor Lupin . 
" First things first : what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world ? " 
Neville's lips moved , but no noise came out . 
Neville looked around rather wildly , as though begging someone to help him , then said , in barely more than a whisper , " Professor Snape . " 
" Professor Snape … hmmm … Neville , I believe you live with your grandmother ? " 
" Er — yes , " said Neville nervously . 
" But — I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either . " 
" I wonder , could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears ? " 
A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top . 
And a long dress … green , normally … and sometimes a fox - fur scarf . " 
" And a handbag ? " prompted Professor Lupin . 
" A big red one , " said Neville . 
" Right then , " said Professor Lupin . 
" When the Boggart bursts out of this wardrobe , Neville , and sees you , it will assume the form of Professor Snape , " said Lupin . 
" And you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ' Riddikulus ' — and concentrate hard on your grandmother's clothes . 
There was a great shout of laughter . 
The wardrobe wobbled more violently . 
" If Neville is successful , the Boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn , " said Professor Lupin . 
" I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most , and imagine how you might force it to look comical … " The room went quiet . 
Harry thought … What scared him most in the world ? 
His first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort returned to full strength . 
But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a Boggart - Voldemort , a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind … A rotting , glistening hand , slithering back beneath a black cloak … a long , rattling breath from an unseen mouth … then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning … Harry shivered , then looked around , hoping no one had noticed . 
Many people had their eyes shut tight . 
Harry was sure he knew what that was about . 
Ron's greatest fear was spiders . 
" Everyone ready ? " said Professor Lupin . 
Harry felt a lurch of fear . 
How could you make a Dementor less frightening ? 
But he didn't want to ask for more time ; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves . 
" Neville , we ' re going to back away , " said Professor Lupin . 
I ' ll call the next person forward … Everyone back , now , so Neville can get a clear shot — " They all retreated , backed against the walls , leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe . 
He looked pale and frightened , but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready . 
" On the count of three , Neville , " said Professor Lupin , who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe . 
" One — two — three — now ! " 
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the doorknob . 
The wardrobe burst open . 
Hook - nosed and menacing , Professor Snape stepped out , his eyes flashing at Neville . 
Snape was bearing down upon him , reaching inside his robes . 
There was a noise like a whip crack . 
Snape stumbled ; he was wearing a long , lace - trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth - eaten vulture , and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag . 
Parvati walked forward , her face set . 
There was another crack , and where he had stood was a bloodstained , bandaged mummy ; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly , dragging its feet , its stiff arms rising — " Riddikulus ! " 
cried Parvati . 
" Seamus ! " roared Professor Lupin . 
Seamus darted past Parvati . 
Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal , green - tinged face — a banshee . 
She opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room , a long , wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry's head stand on end — " Riddikulus ! " 
shouted Seamus . 
The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat ; her voice was gone . 
The banshee turned into a rat , which chased its tail in a circle , then — crack ! - became a rattlesnake , which slithered and writhed before — crack ! 
" It's confused ! " 
shouted Lupin . 
Dean ! " Dean hurried forward . 
The eyeball became a severed hand , which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab . 
" Riddikulus ! " 
yelled Dean . 
There was a snap , and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap . 
" Excellent ! 
Ron , you next ! " Ron leapt forward . 
For a moment , Harry thought Ron had frozen . 
Then — " Riddikulus ! " 
bellowed Ron , and the spider's legs vanished ; it rolled over and over ; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry's feet . 
He raised his wand , ready , but — " Here ! " shouted Professor Lupin suddenly , hurrying forward . 
Then they saw a silvery - white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin , who said , " Riddikulus ! " 
Crack ! " Forward , Neville , and finish him off ! " said Lupin as the Boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach . 
Snape was back . 
This time Neville charged forward looking determined . 
" Riddikulus ! " he shouted , and they had a split second's view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great " Ha ! " of laughter , and the Boggart exploded , burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke , and was gone . 
" Excellent , Neville . 
Well done , everyone … Let me see … five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the Boggart — ten for Neville because he did it twice … and five each to Hermione and Harry . " 
" But I didn't do anything , " said Harry . 
" You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class , Harry , " Lupin said lightly . 
Homework , kindly read the chapter on Boggarts and summarize it for me … o be handed in on Monday . 
That will be all . " 
Talking excitedly , the class left the staffroom . 
Why ? Was it because he'd seen Harry collapse on the train , and thought he wasn't up to much ? 
Had he thought Harry would pass out again ? 
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything . 
" Did you see me take that banshee ? " shouted Seamus . 
" And the hand ! " said Dean , waving his own around . 
" That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we ' ve ever had , wasn't it ? " said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags . 
" He seems like a very good teacher , " said Hermione approvingly . 
" But I wish I could have had a turn with the Boggart — " " What would it have been for you ? " said Ron , sniggering . 
" A piece of homework that only got nine out of ten ? " 
CHAPTER EIGHT : FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
" He dresses like our old house elf . " 
His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first . 
Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days , and no one was in any doubt why . 
The story of the Boggart assuming Snape's shape , and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother's clothes , had traveled through the school like wildfire . 
Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor Trelawney's stifling tower room , deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols , trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him . 
He couldn't like Professor Trelawney , even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class . 
Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times , and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces , as though they knew things the others didn't . 
Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence . 
The Quidditch season was approaching , and O 1 iver Wood , Captain of the Gryffindor team , called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season . 
There were seven people on a Quidditch team : three Chasers , whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle ( a red , soccer - sized ball ) through one of the fifty - foot - high hoops at each end of the field ; two Beaters , who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers ( two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players ) ; a Keeper , who defended the goal posts , and the Seeker , who had the hardest job of all , that of catching the Golden Snitch , a tiny , winged , walnut - sized ball , whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and fifty points . 
Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen - year - old , now in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts . 
There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field . 
" This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup , " he told them , striding up and down in front of them . 
" I ' ll be leaving at the end of this year . 
I ' ll never get another shot at it . 
" Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now . 
Okay , so we ' ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament getting called off last year . " 
" But we also know we ' ve got the best — ruddy — team — in — the — school , " he said , punching a fist into his other hand , the old manic glint back in his eye . 
Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner , Angelina Johnson , and Katie Bell . 
Wood rumbled , glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride . 
" We think you ' re very good too , Oliver , " said George . 
" Spanking good Keeper , " said Fred . " The point is , " Wood went on , resuming his pacing , " the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years . 
Ever since Harry joined the team , I ' ve thought the thing was in the bag . 
" Oliver , this year's our year , " said Fred . " We ' ll do it , Oliver ! " said Angelina . 
" Definitely , " said Harry . 
Full of determination , the team started training sessions , three evenings a week . 
The weather was getting colder and wetter , the nights darker , but no amount of mud , wind , or rain could tarnish Harry's wonderful vision of finally winning the huge , silver Quidditch Cup . 
Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training , cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone , to find the room buzzing excitedly . 
" What's happened ? " , he asked Ron and Hermione , who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy . 
" Excellent , " said Fred , who had followed Harry through the portrait hole . 
" I need to visit Zonko's . 
Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron , his high spirits ebbing away . 
Hermione seemed to read his mind . 
" Harry , I'm sure you ' ll be able to go next time , " she said . 
" They're bound to catch Black soon . 
" Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade , " said Ron . " Ask McGonagall if you can go this time , Harry . 
" Harry's supposed to stay in school — " " He can't be the only third year left behind , " said Ron . " Ask McGonagall , go on , Harry — " " Yeah , I think I will , " said Harry , making up his mind . 
Hermione opened her mouth to argue , but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap . 
" Does he have to eat that in front of us ? " said Ron , scowling . 
" Clever Crookshanks , did you catch that all by yourself ? " said Hermione . 
Crookshanks ; slowly chewed up the spider , his yellow eyes fixed insolently on Ron . 
Harry yawned . 
He really wanted to go to bed , but he still had his own star chart to complete . 
Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron , flicking the end of his bushy tail . 
Then , without warning , he pounced . 
" Oi ! " Ron roared , seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously . 
" GET OFF , YOU STUPID ANIMAL ! " Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks , but Crookshanks clung on , spitting and slashing . 
" Ron , don't hurt him ! " squealed Hermione ; the whole common room was watching ; Ron whirled the bag around , Crookshanks still clinging to it , and Scabbers came flying out of the top — " CATCH THAT CAT ! " Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag , sprang over the table , and chased after the terrified Scabbers . 
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed ; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers . 
Ron and Hermione hurried over ; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and , with great difficulty , pulled Scabbers out by the tail . 
" He's skin and bone ! 
" Crookshanks could smell him , Ron , how else d ' you think — " 
" And Scabbers was here first , and he's ill ! " Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys'dormitories . 
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day . 
" How's Scabbers ? " 
Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail . 
" He's hiding at the bottom of my bed , shaking , " said Ron angrily , missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor . 
Harry , who had resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest , joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case . 
He was distracted , however , by a disturbance at the front of the line . 
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying . 
Parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas , who were looking very serious . 
" What's the matter , Lavender ? " said Hermione anxiously as she , Harry , and Ron went to join the group . 
" She got a letter from home this morning , " Parvati whispered . 
" It's her rabbit , Binky . 
He's been killed by a fox . " " Oh , " said Hermione , " I'm sorry , Lavender . " 
" I should have known ! " said Lavender tragically . 
" You know what day it is ? " " Er — " " The sixteenth of October ! ' That thing you ' re dreading , it will happen on the sixteenth of October ! ' Remember ? 
She was right , she was right ! " 
The whole class was gathered around Lavender now . 
Seamus shook his head seriously . 
Hermione hesitated ; then she said , " You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox ? " " Well , not necessarily by a fox , " said Lavender , looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes , " but I was obviously dreading him dying , wasn't I ? " " Oh , " said Hermione . 
She paused again . 
Then — " Was Binky an old rabbit ? " 
" N — no ! " sobbed Lavender . 
" H — he was only a baby ! " Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders . 
" But then , why would you dread him dying ? " said Hermione . 
Parvati glared at her . " Well , look at it logically , " said Hermione , turning to the rest of the group . 
" I mean , Binky didn't even die today , did he ? 
Lavender just got the news today — " Lavender wailed loudly . 
Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment , which was perhaps lucky ; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other , and when they got into class , they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn't talk to each other for the whole class . 
Harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson , but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first . 
" As you ' re all in my House , you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween . 
Neville put up his hand . 
" Please , Professor , I — I think I ' ve lost — " " Your grandmother sent yours to me directly , Longbottom , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" She seemed to think it was safer . 
Well , that's all , you may leave . " 
" Ask her now , " Ron hissed at Harry . 
" Oh . 
but — " Hermione began . 
" Go for it , Harry , " said Ron stubbornly . 
Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear , then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk . 
" Yes , Potter ? " 
Harry took a deep breath . 
" So — er — d ' you think it would be all right mean , will It be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade ? " 
Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk . 
" I'm afraid not , Potter , " she said . 
No form , no visiting the village . 
That's the rule . " 
" But — Professor , my aunt and uncle — you know , they ' re Muggles , they don't really understand about — about Hogwarts forms and stuff , " Harry said , while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods . 
" The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission . " 
Was it pity ? 
" I'm sorry , Potter , but that's my final word . 
Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione ; Hermione assumed an ' all - for - the - best ' expression that made Ron even angrier , and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first , once they got into Hogsmeade . 
" There's always the feast , " said Ron , in an effort to cheer Harry up . " You know , the Halloween feast , in the evening . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry gloomily , " great . " 
The Halloween feast was always good , but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else . 
Dean Thomas , who was good with a quill , had offered to forge Uncle Vernon's signature on the form , but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn't had it signed , that was no good . 
Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak , but Hermione stamped on that one , reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the Dementors being able to see through them . 
Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort . 
" They make a fuss about Hogsmeade , but I assure you , Harry , it's not all it's cracked up to be , " he said seriously . 
" All right , the sweetshop's rather good , and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous , and yes , the Shrieking Shack's always worth a visit , but really , Harry , apart from that , you ' re not missing anything . " 
On Halloween morning , Harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast , feeling thoroughly depressed , though doing his best to act normally . 
" Yeah , loads , " said Ron . 
He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties . 
He accompanied them to the entrance hall , where Filch , the caretaker , was standing inside the front doors , checking off names against a long list , peering suspiciously into every face , and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn't be going . 
" Staying here , Potter ? " shouted Malfoy , who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle . 
" Scared of passing the Dementors ? " 
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase , through the deserted corridors , and back to Gryffindor Tower . 
" Password ? " said the Fat Lady , jerking out of a doze . 
" Fortuna Major , " said Harry listlessly . 
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room . 
" Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Hi , Harry ! " 
It was Colin Creevey , a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him . 
" Aren't you going to Hogsmeade , Harry ? 
Why not ? 
Hey — " Colin looked eagerly around at his friends — " you can come and sit with us , if you like , Harry ! " " Er — no , thanks , Colin , " said Harry , who wasn't in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead . 
" I — I ' ve got to go to the library , got to get some work done . " 
After that , he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again . 
" What was the point of waking me up ? " the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked away . 
Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library , but halfway there he changed his mind ; he didn't feel like working . 
He turned around and came face - to - face with Filch , who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors . 
" What are you doing ? " Filch snarled suspiciously . 
" Nothing , " said Harry truthfully . 
Harry shrugged . 
But Harry didn't go back to the common room ; he climbed a staircase , thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig , and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said , " Harry ? " 
Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin , looking around his office door . 
" What are you doing ? " said Lupin , though in a very different voice from Filch . 
" Where are Ron and Hermione ? " 
" Hogsmeade , " said Harry , in a would - be casual voice . 
" Ah , " said Lupin . 
He considered Harry for a moment . 
" Why don't you come in ? 
" A what ? " said Harry . 
He followed Lupin into his office . 
In the corner stood a very large tank of water . 
You notice the abnormally long fingers ? 
Strong , but very brittle . " 
The Grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner . 
" All right , " said Harry awkwardly . 
Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout . 
" I ' ve only got teabags , I'm afraid — but I daresay you ' ve had enough of tea leaves ? " 
Harry looked at him . 
Lupin's eyes were twinkling . 
" How did you know about that ? " 
Harry asked . 
" Professor McGonagall told me , " said Lupin , passing Harry a chipped mug of tea . 
" You ' re not worried , are you ? " 
" No , " said Harry . 
He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he'd seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to . 
He didn't want Lupin to think he was a coward , especially since Lupin already seemed to think he couldn't cope with a Boggart . 
Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face , because Lupin said , " Anything worrying you , Harry ? " " No , " Harry lied . 
He drank a bit of tea and watched the Grindylow brandishing a fist at him . 
Lupin raised his eyebrows . 
" I would have thought that was obvious , Harry , " he said , sounding surprised . 
" Why ? " he said again . 
" Well , " said Lupin , frowning slightly , " I assumed that if the Boggart faced you , it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort . " 
Harry stared . 
Not only was this the last answer he'd expected , but Lupin had said Voldemort's name . 
The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud ( apart from himself ) was Professor Dumbledore . 
" I didn't think of Voldemort , " said Harry honestly . 
" I — I remembered those Dementors . " 
" I see , " said Lupin thoughtfully . 
" Well , well … I'm impressed . " 
He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face . 
" That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear . 
Very wise , Harry . " 
Harry didn't know what to say to that , so he drank some more tea . 
" Well … yeah , " said Harry . 
" Professor Lupin , you know the Dementors — " 
He was interrupted by a knock on the door . 
" Come in , " called Lupin . 
The door opened , and in came Snape . 
" Thanks very much . 
Could you leave it here on the desk for me ? " Snape set down the smoking goblet , his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin . 
" I was just showing Harry my Grindylow , " said Lupin pleasantly , pointing at the tank . 
" Fascinating , " said Snape , without looking at it . 
" You should drink that directly , Lupin . " 
" Yes , Yes , I will , " said Lupin . 
" If you need more . " 
" I should probably have some again tomorrow . 
Thanks very much , Severus . " 
He backed out of the room , unsmiling and watchful . 
Harry looked curiously at the goblet . 
Lupin smiled . 
" Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me , " he said . 
He picked up the goblet and sniffed it . 
" Why — ? " Harry began . 
Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question . 
" This potion is the only thing that helps . 
Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands . 
" Disgusting , " he said . 
" Well , Harry , I'd better get back to work . 
See you at the feast later . " 
" Right , " said Harry , putting down his empty teacup . 
The empty goblet was still smoking . 
It was dusk , and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room , pink - faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time of their lives . 
" Thanks , " said Harry , picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps . 
" What's Hogsmeade like ? 
Where did you go ? " 
By the sound of it — everywhere . 
" The post office , Harry ! 
About two hundred owls , all sitting on shelves , all color - coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there ! " 
" Did you get any work done ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office . 
Ron's mouth fell open . 
Hermione checked her watch . 
" We'd better go down , you know , the feast ' ll be starting in five minutes . " 
They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd , still discussing Snape . 
" But if he — you know — " Hermione dropped her voice , glancing nervously around , " if he was trying to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn't have done it in front of Harry . " 
" Yeah , maybe , " said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall . 
It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle - filled pumpkins , a cloud of fluttering live bats , and many flaming orange streamers , which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes . 
Harry kept glancing at the staff table . 
Harry moved his eyes along the table , to the place where Snape sat . 
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts . 
They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding ; Nearly Headless Nick , the Gryffindor ghost , had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading . 
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even be spoiled by Malfoy , who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall , " The Dementors send their love , Potter ! " Harry , Ron , and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower , but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady , they found it jammed with students . 
" Why isn't anyone going in ? " said Ron curiously . 
Harry peered over the heads in front of him . 
The portrait seemed to be closed . 
" Let me through , please , " came Percy's voice , and he came bustling importantly through the crowd . 
" What's the holdup here ? 
You can't all have forgotten the password — excuse me , I'm Head Boy — " And then a silence fell over the crowd , from the front first , so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor . 
" What's going on ? " said Ginny , who had just arrived . 
A moment later , Professor Dumbledore was there , sweeping toward the portrait ; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through , and Harry , Ron , and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was . 
" Oh , my — " Hermione grabbed Harry's arm . 
Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned , his eyes somber , to see Professors McGonagall , Lupin , and Snape hurrying toward him . 
" We need to find her , " said Dumbledore . " Professor McGonagall , please go to Mr . Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady . " " You ' ll be lucky ! " said a cackling voice . 
It was Peeves the Poltergeist , bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted , as he always did , at the sight of wreckage or worry . 
" What do you mean , Peeves ? " said Dumbledore calmly , and Peeves's grin faded a little . 
Doesn't want to be seen . 
Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor , sir , dodging between the trees . 
Crying something dreadful , " he said happily . 
" Poor thing . " he added unconvincingly . 
" Did she say who did it ? " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Nasty temper he's got , that Sirius Black . " 
Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall , where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin , who all looked extremely confused . 
" The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle , " Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall . 
" I'm afraid that , for your own safety , you will have to spend the night here . 
I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge . 
" Send word with one of the ghosts . " 
Professor Dumbledore paused , about to leave the hall , and said , " Oh , yes , you ' ll be needing … " One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls ; another wave , and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags . 
" Sleep well , " said Professor Dumbledore , closing the door behind him . 
The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly ; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened . 
" Come on , now , no more talking ! 
Lights out in ten minutes ! " " C ' mon , " Ron said to Harry and Hermione ; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner . 
" Do you think Black's still in the castle ? " 
Hermione whispered anxiously . 
Hermione shuddered . 
All around them , people were asking one another the same question : " How did he get in ? " " Maybe he knows how to Apparate , " said a Ravenclaw a few feet away , " Just appear out of thin air , you know . " 
" Honestly , am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts , A History ? " said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron . 
" Probably , " said Ron . " Why ? " " Because the castle's protected by more than walls , you know , " said Hermione . 
They're guarding every single entrance to the grounds . 
And Filch knows all the secret passages , they ' ll have them covered … " " The lights are going out now ! " Percy shouted . 
The candles all went out at once . 
The only light now came from the silvery ghosts , who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects , and the enchanted ceiling , which , like the sky outside , was scattered with stars . 
What with that , and the whispering that still filled the hall , Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind . 
Once every hour , a teacher would reappear in the Hall to check that everything was quiet . 
Around three in the morning , when many students had finally fallen asleep , Professor Dumbledore came in . 
Percy was only a short way away from Harry , Ron , and Hermione , who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore's footsteps drew nearer . 
asked Percy in a whisper . 
" No . 
All well here ? " 
I ' ve found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole . 
" And the Fat Lady , sir ? " " Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor . 
Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password , so he attacked . 
Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again , and more footsteps . 
It was Snape . 
" The whole of the third floor has been searched . 
He's not there . 
" What about the Astronomy tower ? 
Professor Trelawney's room ? 
The Owlery ? " " All searched … " " Very well , Severus . 
asked Snape . 
Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear . 
" Many , Severus , each of them as unlikely as the next . " 
Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood ; Dumbledore's back was to him , but he could see Percy's face , rapt with attention , and Snape's profile , which looked angry . 
" You remember the conversation we had , Headmaster , just before — ah — the start of term ? " said Snape , who was barely opening his lips , as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation . 
" I must go down to the Dementors , " said Dumbledore . " I said I would inform them when our search was complete . " 
" Oh yes , " said Dumbledore coldly . 
" But I'm afraid no Dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am Headmaster . " 
Percy looked slightly abashed . 
Dumbledore left the hall , walking quickly and quietly . 
Snape stood for a moment , watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face ; then he too left . 
Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione . 
Both of them had their eyes open too , reflecting the starry ceiling . 
" What was all that about ? " 
Ron mouthed . 
The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days . 
The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony . 
Nobody was very happy about this . 
Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels , and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords , which he changed at least twice a day . 
" He's a complete lunatic , " said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy . 
" Can't we get anyone else ? " " None of the other pictures wanted the job , " said Percy . 
" Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady . 
Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer . " 
Sir Cadogan , however , was the least of Harry's worries . 
To cap it all , Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office , with such a somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died . 
" There's no point hiding it from you any longer , Potter , " she said in a very serious voice . 
" I know this will come as a shock to you , but Sirius Black — " " I know he's after me , " said Harry wearily . 
" I heard Ron's dad telling his mum . 
Mr . Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic . " 
Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback . 
She stared at Harry for a moment or two , then said , " I see ! 
Well , in that case , Potter , you ' ll understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings . 
" I ' ve got to train , Professor ! " 
Professor McGonagall considered him intently . 
Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects ; it had been she , after all , who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place . 
He waited , holding his breath . 
" Hmm … " Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field , just visible through the rain . 
" Well … goodness knows , I'd like to see us win the Cup at last … but all the same , Potter … I'd be happier if a teacher were present . 
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer . 
Undaunted , the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch . 
" Flint's just been to see me . 
" Why ? " chorused the rest of the team . 
" Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured , " said Wood , grinding his teeth furiously . 
" But it's obvious why they ' re doing it . 
Don't want to play in this weather . 
" There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm ! " said Harry furiously . 
" He's faking it ! " 
" I know that , but we can't prove it , " said Wood bitterly , " And we ' ve been practicing all those moves assuming we ' re playing Slytherin , and instead it's Hufflepuff , and their style's quite different . 
They ' ve got a new Captain and Seeker , Cedric Diggory — " Angelina , Alicia , and Katie suddenly giggled . 
" What ? " said Wood , frowning at this lighthearted behavior . 
Last time we played them , Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes , remember ? " 
" We were playing in completely different conditions ! " Wood shouted , his eyes bulging slightly . 
" Diggory's put a very strong side together ! 
I was afraid you'd take it like this ! 
We must keep our focus ! 
We must win ! " " Oliver , calm down ! " said Fred , looking slightly alarmed . 
Seriously . " 
The day before the match , the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever . 
It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit . 
" Ah , if only my arm was feeling a bit better ! " he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows . 
Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips . 
The third time this happened , Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts , and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him , " Diggory's got a very fast swerve , Harry , so you might want to try looping him — " Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom , pulled the door open , and dashed inside . 
" Sorry I'm late , Professor Lupin . 
I — " But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's desk ; it was Snape . 
Sit down . " 
But Harry didn't move . 
" Where's Professor Lupin ? " he said . 
" He says he is feeling too ill to teach today , " said Snape with a twisted smile . 
" I believe I told you to sit down ? " 
But Harry stayed where he was . 
" What's wrong with him ? " 
Snape's black eyes glittered . 
" Nothing life - threatening , " he said , looking as though he wished it were . 
" Five more points from Gryffindor , and if I have to ask you to sit down again , it will be fifty . " 
Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down . 
Snape looked around at the class . 
" As I was saying before Potter interrupted , Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — " " Please , sir , we ' ve done Boggarts , Red Caps , Kappas , and Grindylows , " said Hermione quickly , " and we ' re just about to start — " " Be quiet , " said Snape coldly . 
" I did not ask for information . 
" He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we ' ve ever had , " said Dean Thomas boldly , and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class . 
Snape looked more menacing than ever . 
" You are easily satisfied . 
Today we shall discuss — " Harry watched him flick through the textbook , to the very back chapter , which he must know they hadn't covered . 
" — werewolves , " said Snape . 
" But , sir , " said Hermione , seemingly unable to restrain herself , " we ' re not supposed to do werewolves yet , we ' re due to start Hinkypunks — " " Miss Granger , " said Snape in a voice of deadly calm , " I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson , not you . 
And I am telling you all to turn to page 394 . " 
He glanced around again . 
" All of you ! 
" Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf ? " said Snape . 
" Anyone ? " Snape said , ignoring Hermione . 
" Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the basic distinction between — " " We told you , " said Parvati suddenly , " we haven't got as far as werewolves yet , we ' re still on -- " " Silence ! " 
snarled Snape . 
" Well , well , well , I never thought I'd meet a third - year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one . 
I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are … " " Please , sir , " said Hermione , whose hand was still in the air , " the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways . 
The snout of the werewolf — " " That is the second time you have spoken out of turn , Miss Granger , " said Snape coolly . 
Hermione went very red , put down her hand , and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears . 
It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him , because every one of them had called Hermione a know - it - all at least once , and Ron , who told Hermione she was a know - it - all at least twice a week , said loudly , " You asked us a question and she knows the answer ! 
Snape advanced on Ron slowly , and the room held its breath . 
" Detention , Weasley , " Snape said silkily , his face very close to Ron's . 
" And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again , you will be very sorry indeed . " 
No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson . 
They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook , while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks , examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin . 
Weasley , stay behind , we need to arrange your detention . " 
Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class , who waited until they were well out of earshot , then burst into a furious tirade about Snape . 
" Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , even if he did want the job , " Harry said to Hermione . 
" Why's he got it in for Lupin ? 
D ' you think this is all because of the Boggart ? " " I don't know , " said Hermione pensively . 
I ' ve got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing . 
" Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office , eh ? 
He could have finished him off for us ! " Harry woke extremely early the next morning ; so early that it was still dark . 
For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him . 
Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him , blowing hard in his ear . 
" What did you do that for ? " said Harry furiously . 
Peeves puffed out his cheeks , blew hard , and zoomed backward out of the room , cackling . 
Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it . 
It was half past four . 
Cursing Peeves , he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep , but it was very difficult , now that he was awake , to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead , the pounding of the wind against the castle walls , and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest . 
Finally , he gave up any thought of more sleep , got up , dressed , picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand , and walked quietly out of the dormitory . 
As Harry opened the door , something brushed against his leg . 
He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside . 
" You know , I reckon Ron was right about you , " Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously . 
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room . 
Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor ; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry . 
Seekers were usually light and speedy , but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course . 
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire , getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys'staircase again . 
" Oh , shut up , " Harry yawned . 
He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge , and by the time he'd started on toast , the rest of the team had turned up . 
Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual , but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field , heads bowed against the ferocious wind , umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went . 
just before he entered the locker room , Harry saw Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium . 
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual pre - match pep talk , but it didn't come . 
He tried to speak several times , made an odd gulping noise , then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him . 
The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field . 
If the crowd was cheering , they couldn't hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder . 
Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses . 
How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this ? 
The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field , wearing canary - yellow robes . 
The Captains walked up to each other and shook hands ; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded . 
Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words , " Mount Your brooms . " 
He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand . 
Harry rose fast , but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind . 
He held it as steady as he could and turned , squinting into the rain . 
Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen , hardly able to see his teammates , let alone the tiny Snitch . 
He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes , with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game . 
He couldn't hear the commentary over the wind . 
The sky was getting darker , as though night had decided to come early . 
Twice Harry nearly hit another player , without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent ; everyone was now so wet , and the rain so thick , he could hardly tell them apart … With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's whistle ; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain , gesturing him to the ground . 
The whole team splashed down into the mud . 
Wood roared at his team . 
" Come on , under here — " They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella ; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes . 
" What's the score ? " " We're fifty points up , " said Wood , " but unless we get the Snitch soon , we ' ll be playing into the night . " 
He handed them to her , and as the team watched in amazement , Hermione tapped them with her wand and said , " Impervius ! " 
" There ! " she said , handing them back to Harry . 
" Okay , team , let's go for it ! " 
Hermione's spell had done the trick . 
Full of fresh determination , he urged his broom through the turbulent air , staring in every direction for the Snitch , avoiding a Bludger , ducking beneath Diggory , who was streaking in the opposite direction … There was another clap of thunder , followed immediately by forked lightning . 
This was getting more and more dangerous . 
Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly — He turned , intending to head back toward the middle of the field , but at that moment , another flash of lightning illuminated the stands , and Harry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog , clearly imprinted against the sky , motionless in the topmost , empty row of seats . 
Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes , he squinted back into the stands . 
The dog had vanished . 
" Harry ! " came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts . 
" Harry , behind you ! " Harry looked wildly around . 
Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field , and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain - filled air between them … With a jolt of panic , Harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the Snitch . 
" Come on ! " he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face . 
" Faster ! " 
The wind , though as strong as ever , was forgetting to roar . 
It was as though someone had turned off the sound , as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on ? 
And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him , inside him , just as he became aware of something moving on the field below … Before he'd had time to think , Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down . 
At least a hundred Dementors , their hidden faces pointing up at him , were standing beneath him . 
And then he heard it again … Someone was screaming , screaming inside his head … a woman … " Not Harry , not Harry , please not Harry ! " " Stand aside , you silly girl … stand aside , now … " " Not Harry , please no , take me , kill me instead — " 
Numbing , swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain … What was he doing ? 
Why was he flying ? 
He needed to help her … She was going to die … She was going to be murdered … He was falling , falling through the icy mist . 
" Not Harry ! 
" I thought he was dead for sure . " 
Harry could hear the voices whispering , but they made no sense whatsoever . 
All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten . 
" That was the scariest thing I ' ve ever seen in my life . " 
He was lying in the hospital wing . 
The Gryffindor Quidditch team , spattered with mud from head to foot , was gathered around his bed . 
Ron and Hermione were also there , looking as though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool . 
" Harry ! " said Fred , who looked extremely white underneath , the mud . 
" How ' re you feeling ? " 
It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward . 
The lightning … the Grim … the Snitch … and the Dementors … " What happened ? " he said , sitting up so suddenly they all gasped . 
" But the match , " said Harry . 
" What happened ? 
No one said anything . 
When he looked back and saw you on the ground , he tried to call it off . 
But they won fair and square … even Wood admits it . " 
" Where is Wood ? " said Harry , suddenly realizing he wasn't there . 
Harry put his face to his knees , his hands gripping his hair . 
" It's not over yet , " said Fred . " We lost by a hundred points . " 
" Right ? 
So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin … " " Hufflepuff ' ll have to lose by at least two hundred points , " said George . 
" But if they beat Ravenclaw … " " No way , Ravenclaw is too good . 
But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff … " " It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way — " Harry lay there , not saying a word . 
They had lost … for the first time ever , he had lost a Quidditch match . 
After ten minutes or so , Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace . 
The team trooped out , trailing mud behind them . 
Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them , looking disapproving . 
Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry's bed . 
" Dumbledore was really angry , " Hermione said in a quaking voice . 
" I ' ve never seen him like that before . 
He ran onto the field as you fell , waved his wand , and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground . 
Then he whirled his wand at the Dementors . 
They left the stadium right away … He was furious they'd come onto the grounds . 
Everyone thought you were … " His voice faded , but Harry hardly noticed . 
He was thinking about what the Dementors had done to him … about the screaming voice . 
He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter - of - fact to say . 
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other . 
" Er — " " What ? " said Harry , looking from one to the other . 
" Well … when you fell off , it got blown away , " said Hermione hesitantly . 
" And ? " 
" And it hit — it hit — oh , Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow . " 
Harry's insides lurched . 
The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds . 
" And ? " he said , dreading the answer . 
Slowly , she reached down for a bag at her feet , turned it upside down , and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed , the only remains of Harry's faithful , finally beaten broomstick . 
Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend . 
He didn't argue or complain , but he wouldn't let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand . 
He knew he was being stupid , knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair , but Harry couldn't help it ; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best friends . 
Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at night . 
But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better , because they knew only half of what was troubling him . 
He hadn't told anyone about the Grim , not even Ron and Hermione , because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff . 
The fact remained , however , that it had now appeared twice , and both appearances had been followed by near - fatal accidents ; the first time , he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus ; the second , fallen fifty feet from his broomstick . 
Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast ? 
Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them . 
Everyone said the Dementors were horrible , but no one else collapsed every time they went near one . 
Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now . 
He had heard her words , heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake , staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling . 
When the Dementors approached him , he heard the last moments of his mother's life , her attempts to protect him , Harry , from Lord Voldemort , and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered her … Harry dozed fitfully , sinking into dreams full of clammy , rotted hands and petrified pleading , jerking awake to dwell again on his mother's voice . 
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday , where he was forced to think about other things , even if he had to endure Draco Malfoy's taunting . 
Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor's defeat . 
Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing Dementor imitations across the dungeon ; Ron finally cracked and flung a large , slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy , which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor . 
" Check who's in there , Hermione . " 
Hermione peered around the classroom door . 
" It's not fair , he was only filling in , why should he give us homework ? " 
" We don't know anything about werewolves — " " — two rolls of parchment ! " 
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face . 
" Don't worry . 
I ' ll speak to Professor Snape . 
You don't have to do the essay . " 
" Oh no , " said Hermione , looking very disappointed . 
" I ' ve already finished it ! " 
Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a Hinkypunk , a little one - legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke , rather frail and harmless looking . 
" You notice the lantern dangling from his hand ? 
Hops ahead — people follow the light — then — " The Hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass . 
When the bell rang , everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door , Harry among them , but — " Wait a moment , Harry , " Lupin called . 
" I'd like a word . " 
Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the Hinkypunk's box with a cloth . 
" No , " said Harry . 
" The tree smashed it to bits . " 
Lupin sighed . 
" They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts . 
People used to play a game , trying to get near enough to touch the trunk . 
" Did you hear about the Dementors too ? " said Harry with difficulty . 
Lupin looked at him quickly . 
" Yes , I did . 
I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry . 
He hesitated , and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself . 
" Why ? 
Why do they affect me like that ? 
Am I just — ? " " It has nothing to do with weakness , " said Professor Lupin sharply , as though he had read Harry's mind . 
" The Dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have . " 
A ray of wintry sunlight fell across the classroom , illuminating Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face . 
They infest the darkest , filthiest places , they glory in decay and despair , they drain peace , hope , and happiness out of the air around them . 
Even Muggles feel their presence , though they can't see them . 
If it can , the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself — soul - less and evil . 
You ' ll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life . 
And the worst that happened to you , Harry , is enough to make anyone fall off their broom . 
You have nothing to feel ashamed of . " 
" When they get near me — " Harry stared at Lupin's desk , his throat tight . 
" I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum . " 
There was a moment's silence , then — " Why did they have to come to the match ? " said Harry bitterly . 
" Dumbledore won't let them into the school , so their supply of human prey has dried up … I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field . 
" Azkaban must be terrible , " Harry muttered . 
" The fortress is set on a tiny island , way out to sea , but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in , not when they ' re all trapped inside their own heads , incapable of a single cheery thought . 
" But Sirius Black escaped from them , " Harry said slowly . 
" He got away … " Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk ; he had to stoop quickly to catch it . 
" There are — certain defenses one can use , " said Lupin . 
" But there was only one Dementor on the train . 
The more there are , the more difficult it becomes to resist . " 
" What defenses ? " said Harry at once . 
" Can you teach me ? " " I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting Dementors , Harry — quite the contrary … " " But if the Dementors come to another Quidditch match , I need to be able to fight them — " Lupin looked into Harry's determined face , hesitated , then said , " Well … all right . 
But it ' ll have to wait until next term , I'm afraid . 
I have a lot to do before the holidays . 
What with the promise of anti - Dementor lessons from Lupin , the thought that he might never have to hear his mother's death again , and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November , Harry's mood took a definite upturn . 
Gryffindor were not out of the running after all , although they could not afford to lose another match . 
Wood became repossessed of his manic energy , and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December . 
Harry saw no hint of a Dementor within the grounds . 
Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances . 
Two weeks before the end of the term , the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling , opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost . 
Inside the castle , there was a buzz of Christmas in the air . 
Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real , fluttering fairies . 
The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays . 
Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts , and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand two weeks with Percy , and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library , Harry wasn't fooled ; they were doing it to keep him company , and he was very grateful . 
To everyone's delight except Harry's , there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term . 
" We can do all our Christmas shopping there ! " said Hermione . 
" Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes ! " Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again , Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood , and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes . 
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip , Harry bid good - bye to Ron and Hermione , who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves , then turned up the marble staircase alone , and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower . 
Snow had started to fall outside the windows , and the castle was very still and quiet . 
" Psst — Harry ! " 
He turned , halfway along the third - floor corridor , to see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked , one - eyed witch . 
" What are you doing ? " said Harry curiously . 
" How come you ' re not going to Hogsmeade ? " " We ' ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go , " said Fred , with a mysterious wink . 
" Come in here … " He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one - eyed statue . 
Harry followed Fred and George inside . 
George closed the door quietly and then turned , beaming , to look at Harry . 
" Early Christmas present for you , Harry , " he said . 
Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks . 
Harry , suspecting one of Fred and George's jokes , stared at it . 
" What's that supposed to be ? " " This , Harry , is the secret of our success , " said George , patting the parchment fondly . 
" It's a wrench , giving it to you , " said Fred , " but we decided last night , your need's greater than ours . " 
" We bequeath it to you . 
We don't really need it anymore . " 
" And what do I need with a bit of old parchment ? " said Harry . 
" A bit of old parchment ! " said Fred , closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him . 
" Explain , George . " 
" Well … when we were in our first year , Harry — young , carefree , and innocent — " Harry snorted . 
He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent . 
" We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason — " " So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual — " " — detention — " " — disembowelment — " " — and we couldn't help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous . " 
" Don't tell me — " said Harry , starting to grin . 
He probably suspected what it was , though , or he wouldn't have confiscated it . " 
" And you know how to work it ? " 
" Oh yes , " said Fred , smirking . 
" This little beauty's taught us more than all the teachers in this school . " 
" Oh , are we ? " said George . 
He took out his wand , touched the parchment lightly , and said , " I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . " 
And at once , thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the point that George's wand had touched . 
They joined each other , they crisscrossed , they fanned into every corner of the parchment ; then words began to blossom across the top , great , curly green words , that proclaimed : Messrs . Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs 
Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief - Makers are proud to present THE MARAUDER ' S MAP It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds . 
But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it , each labeled with a name in minuscule writing . 
Astounded , Harry bent over it . 
A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study ; the caretaker's cat , Mrs . Norris , was prowling the second floor ; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room . 
And as Harry's eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors , he noticed something else . 
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered . 
And many of them seemed to lead — " Right into Hogsmeade , " said Fred , tracing one of them with his finger . 
" There are seven in all . 
Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor . 
We used it until last winter , but it's caved in — completely blocked . 
And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one , because the Whomping Willow's planted right over the entrance . 
But this one here , this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes . 
" Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs , " sighed George , patting the heading of the map . 
" We owe them so much . " 
" Noble men , working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers , " said Fred solemnly . 
" Right , " said George briskly . 
" Don't forget to wipe it after you ' ve used it — " " — or anyone can read it , " Fred said warningly . 
They left the room , both smirking in a satisfied sort of way . 
Harry stood there , gazing at the miraculous map . 
He watched the tiny ink Mrs . Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor . 
Never trust anything that can think for itself , if you can't see where it keeps its brain . 
This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr . Weasley had been warning against … Aids for Magical Mischief Makers … but then , Harry reasoned , he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade , it wasn't as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone … and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening … Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger . 
Then , quite suddenly , as though following orders , he rolled up the map , stuffed it inside his robes , and hurried to the door of the classroom . 
He opened it a couple of inches . 
There was no one outside . 
Very carefully , he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one - eyed witch . 
What did he have to do ? 
He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment , that a new ink figure had appeared upon it , labeled ' Harry Potter ' . 
This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing , about halfway down the third - floor corridor . 
Harry watched carefully . 
Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue . 
Nothing happened . 
He looked back at the map . 
The word inside said , ' Dissendium . ' 
" Dissendium ! " 
Harry whispered , tapping the stone witch again . 
At once , the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person . 
Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor , then tucked the map away again , hoisted himself into the hole headfirst , and pushed himself forward . 
He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide , then landed on cold , damp earth . 
He stood up , looking around . 
It was pitch dark . 
He raised the map , tapped it with the tip of his wand , and muttered , " Mischief managed ! " 
He folded it carefully , tucked it inside his robes , then , heart beating fast , both excited and apprehensive , he set off . 
The passage twisted and turned , more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else . 
Harry hurried along it , stumbling now and then on the uneven floor , holding his wand out in front of him . 
It took ages , but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him . 
After what felt like an hour , the passage began to rise . 
Panting , Harry sped up , his face hot , his feet very cold . 
Ten minutes later , he came to the foot of some worn stone steps , which rose out of sight above him . 
Careful not to make any noise , Harry began to climb . 
It seemed to be a trapdoor . 
Harry stood there , massaging the top of his head , listening . 
Very slowly , he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge . 
He was in a cellar , which was full of wooden crates and boxes . 
Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it — it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there . 
Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs . 
Now he could definitely hear voices , not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door . 
Wondering what he ought to do , he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand ; somebody was about to come downstairs . 
" And get another box of Jelly Slugs , dear , they ' ve nearly cleaned us out — " said a woman's voice . 
Harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass . 
He heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall . 
He might not get another chance — Quickly and silently , Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs ; looking back , he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head , buried in a box . 
Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs , slipped through it , and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes — he ducked , crept sideways , and then straightened up . 
Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry . 
He edged among them , looking around , and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face if he could see where Harry was now . 
Creamy chunks of nougat , shimmering pink squares of coconut ice , fat , honey - colored toffees ; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows ; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans , and another of Fizzing Whizbees , the levitating sherbet balls that Ron had mentioned ; along yet another wall were ' Special Effects ' — sweets : Droobles Best Blowing Gum ( which filled a room with bluebellcolored bubbles that refused to pop for days ) , the strange , splintery Toothflossing Stringmints , tiny black Pepper Imps ( ' breathe fire for your friends ! ' ) , Ice Mice ( ' hear your teeth chatter and squeak ! ' ) , peppermint creams shaped like toads ( ' hop realistically in the stomach ! ' ) , fragile sugar - spun quills , and exploding bonbons . 
Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop ( UNUSUAL TASTES ) . 
Harry sneaked up behind them . 
" How about these ? " said Ron , shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione's nose . 
" Definitely not , " said Harry . 
Ron nearly dropped the jar . 
" Harry ! " squealed Hermione . 
" What are you doing here ? 
How — how did you — ? " " Wow ! " said Ron , looking very impressed , " you ' ve learned to Apparate ! " " ' Course I haven't , " said Harry . 
He dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder's Map . 
" I'm their brother ! " 
" But Harry isn't going to keep it ! " said Hermione , as though the idea were ludicrous . 
" He's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall , aren't you , Harry ? " " No , I'm not ! " said Harry . 
" Are you mad ? " said Ron , goggling at Hermione . 
" Hand in something that good ? " " If I hand it in , I ' ll have to say where I got it ! 
Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it ! " 
" But what about Sirius Black ? " Hermione hissed . 
" He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle ! 
" There are seven secret tunnels on the map , right ? 
And of the other three — one of them's caved in , so no one can get through it . 
One of them's got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance , so you can't get out of it . 
And the one I just came through — well — it's really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar — so unless he knew it was there — " Harry hesitated . 
Ron , however , cleared his throat significantly , and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door . 
BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Customers are reminded that until further notice , Dementors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown . 
This measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black . 
It is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall . 
Merry Christmas ! 
" See ? " said Ron quietly . 
They live over the shop ! " 
" Yes , but — but — " Heroine seemed to be struggling to find another problem . 
If anyone finds out , he ' ll be in so much trouble ! 
And it's not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns up today ? 
Now ? " " He'd have a job spotting Harry in this , " said Ron , nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick , swirling snow . 
" Come on , Hermione , it's Christmas . 
Harry deserves a break . " 
Hermione bit her lip , looking extremely worried . 
" Are you going to report me ? " 
Harry asked her , grinning . 
" Oh — of course not — but honestly , Harry — " " Seen the Fizzing Whizbees , Harry ? " said Ron , grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel . 
" And the Jelly Slugs ? 
And the Acid Pops ? 
Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through my tongue . 
I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick . " 
When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets , the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside . 
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card ; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow ; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees . 
They headed up the street , heads bowed against the wind , Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves . 
" That's the post office — " " Zonko's is up there — " " We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — " " Tell you what , " said Ron , his teeth chattering , " shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks ? " 
Harry was more than willing ; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing , so they crossed the road , and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn . 
It was extremely crowded , noisy , warm , and smoky . 
A curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar . 
Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room , where there was a small , vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree , which stood next to the fireplace . 
" Merry Christmas ! " he said happily , raising his tankard . 
Harry drank deeply . 
It was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside . 
The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again . 
Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked . 
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes , shortly followed by Hagrid , who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime - green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak — Cornelius Fudge , Minister of Magic . 
In an instant , Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of Harry's head and forced him off his stool and under the table . 
Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight , Harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers ' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar , pause , then turn and walk right toward him . 
Somewhere above him , Hermione whispered , " Mobiliarbus ! " 
The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground , drifted sideways , and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table , hiding them from view . 
Staring through the dense lower branches , Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs , then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down . 
Next he saw another pair of feet , wearing sparkly turquoise high heels , and heard a woman's voice . 
" A small gillywater — " " Mine , " said Professor McGonagall's voice . 
" A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella — " " Mmm ! " said Professor Flitwick , smacking his lips . 
" Thank you , Rosmerta , m'dear , " said Fudge's voice . 
" Lovely to see you again , I must say . 
Have one yourself , won't you ? 
Come and join us … " " Well , thank you very much , Minister . " 
Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again . 
Why hadn't it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too ? 
And how long were they going to sit there ? 
He needed time to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight … Hermione's leg gave a nervous twitch next to him . 
" So , what brings you to this neck of the woods , Minister ? " 
came Madam Rosmerta's voice . 
Then he said in a quiet voice , " What else , m'dear , but Sirius Black ? 
I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween ? " " I did hear a rumor , " admitted Madam Rosmerta . 
" Did you tell the whole pub , Hagrid ? " said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly . 
" Do you think Black's still in the area , Minister ? " 
whispered Madam Rosmerta . 
" I'm sure of it , " said Fudge shortly . 
" Scared all my customers away … It's very bad for business , Minister . " 
" Rosmerta , dear , I don't like them any more than you do , " said Fudge uncomfortably . 
" Necessary precaution … unfortunate , but there you are … I ' ve just met some of them . 
" I should think not , " said Professor McGonagall sharply . 
" All the same , " demurred Fudge , " they are here to protect you all from something much worse … We all know what Black's capable of … " " Do you know , I still have trouble believing it , " said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully . 
" Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side , Sirius Black was the last I'd have thought … I mean , I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts . 
If you'd told me then what he was going to become , I'd have said you'd had too much mead . " 
" You don't know the half of it , Rosmerta , " said Fudge gruffly . 
" The worst he did isn't widely known . " 
" I can't believe that . 
What could possibly be worse ? " 
" You say you remember him at Hogwarts , Rosmerta , " murmured Professor McGonagall . 
" Do you remember who his best friend was ? " " Naturally , " said Madam Rosmerta , with a small laugh . 
The number of times I had them in here — ooh , they used to make me laugh . 
Ron kicked him . 
" Precisely , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Black and Potter . 
Ringleaders of their little gang . 
Both very bright , of course — exceptionally bright , in fact — but I don't think we ' ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers — " " I dunno , " chuckled Hagrid . 
" You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers ! " 
chimed in Professor Flitwick . 
" Of course they were , " said Fudge . 
Nothing changed when they left school . 
Black was best man when James married Lily . 
Then they named him godfather to Harry . 
Harry has no idea , of course . 
You can imagine how the idea would torment him . " 
whispered Madam Rosmerta . 
Dumbledore , who was of course working tirelessly against You - Know - Who , had a number of useful spies . 
One of them tipped him off , and he alerted James and Lily at once . 
He advised them to go into hiding . 
Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm . " 
Professor Flitwick cleared his throat . 
" An immensely complex spell , " he said squeakily , " involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single , living soul . 
The information is hidden inside the chosen person , or Secret - Keeper , and is henceforth impossible to find — unless , of course , the Secret - Keeper chooses to divulge it . 
As long as the Secret - Keeper refused to speak , You - Know - Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them , not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window ! " 
" Naturally , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were , that Black was planning to go into hiding himself … and yet , Dumbledore remained worried . 
I remember him offering to be the Potters ' Secret - Keeper himself . " 
" He suspected Black ? " gasped Madam Rosmerta . 
" Indeed , he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You - Know - Who . " 
" But James Potter insisted on using Black ? " " He did , " said Fudge heavily . 
" He did indeed . 
Black was tired of his double - agent role , he was ready to declare his support openly for You - Know - Who , and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters'death . 
And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed . 
Hagrid said , so loudly that half the bar went quiet . 
" Shh ! " said Professor McGonagall . 
" I met him ! " growled Hagrid . 
" I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people ! 
It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an ' James's house after they was killed ! 
An ' yeh know what I did ? 
I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN ' TRAITOR ! " Hagrid roared . 
" Hagrid , please ! " said Professor McGonagall . 
It was You - Know - Who he cared abou ' ! 
An'then he says , ' Give Harry ter me , Hagrid , I'm his godfather , I ' ll look after him — ' Ha ! 
But I'd had me orders from Dumbledore , an ' I told Black no , Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an ' uncle's . 
Black argued , but in the end he gave in . 
' I won't need it anymore , ' he says . 
Why wouldn ' he need it anymore ? 
Fact was , it was too easy ter trace . 
Dumbledore knew he'd bin the Potters ' Secret - Keeper . 
Black knew he was goin'ter have ter run fer it that night , knew it was a matter o ' hours before the Ministry was after him . 
But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side , there's nothin ' and no one that matters to em anymore … " A long silence followed Hagrid's story . 
Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction , " But he didn't manage to disappear , did he ? 
The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day ! " 
" It was not we who found him . 
It was little Peter Pettigrew — another of the Potters ' friends . 
" Hero — worshipped Black and Potter , " said Professor McGonagall . 
I was often rather sharp with him . 
You can imagine how I — how I regret that now … " She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold . 
" There , now , Minerva , " said Fudge kindly , " Pettigrew died a hero's death . 
Eyewitnesses — Muggles , of course , we wiped their memories later — told us how Pettigrew cornered Black . 
They say he was sobbing , ' Lily and James , Sirius ! 
How could you ? ' 
Well , of course , Black was quicker . 
" You don't know what you ' re talking about , Hagrid , " said Fudge sharply . 
I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time , and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people . 
I — I will never forget it . 
I still dream about it sometimes . 
A crater in the middle of the street , so deep it had cracked the sewer below . 
And Black standing there laughing , with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him … a heap of bloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments — " Fudge's voice stopped abruptly . 
There was the sound of five noses being blown . 
" Black was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin , First Class , which I think was some comfort to his poor mother . 
Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh . 
" I wish I could say that he was , " said Fudge slowly . 
The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man — cruel … pointless . 
You know , most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark ; there's no sense in them … but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed . 
He spoke quite rationally to me . 
It was unnerving . 
Yes , I was astounded at how little effect the Dementors seemed to be having on him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place , you know . 
Dementors outside his door day and night . " 
" But what do you think he's broken out to do ? " said Madam Rosmerta . 
" But we hope to catch Black long before that . 
" You know , Cornelius , if you ' re dining with the headmaster , we'd better head back up to the castle , " said Professor McGonagall . 
One by one , the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their owners once more ; hems of cloaks swung into sight , and Madam Rosmerta's glittering heels disappeared behind the bar . 
The door of the Three Broomsticks opened again , there was another flurry of snow , and the teachers had disappeared . 
" Harry ? " 
Ron's and Hermione's faces appeared under the table . 
Harry didn't have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar , through the tunnel , and into the castle once more . 
All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all , and that he hardly noticed what he was doing , because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard . 
Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through dinner , not daring to talk about what they'd overheard , because Percy was sitting close by them . 
When they went upstairs to the crowded common room , it was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of endof - term high spirits . 
Harry , who didn't want Fred and George asking him whether he'd reached Hogsmeade or not , sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet . 
He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for — the leather - bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago , which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father . 
He sat down on his bed , drew the hangings around him , and started turning the pages , searching , until … He stopped on a picture of his parents ' wedding day . 
There was his father waving up at him , beaming , the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions . 
And there … that must be him . 
Their best man … Harry had never given him a thought before . 
If he hadn't known it was the same person , he would never have guessed it was Black in this old photograph . 
Was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him ? 
Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban , twelve years that would make him unrecognizable ? 
But the Dementors don't affect him , Harry thought , staring into the handsome , laughing face . 
He doesn't have to hear my Mum screaming if they get too close — Harry slammed the album shut , reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet , took off his robe and glasses and got into bed , making sure the hangings were hiding him from view . 
The dormitory door opened . 
" Harry ? " said Ron's voice uncertainly . 
But Harry lay still , pretending to be asleep . 
He heard Ron leave again , and rolled over on his back , his eyes wide open . 
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison . 
He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness , as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes . 
He watched , as though somebody was playing him a piece of film , Sirius Black blasting Peter Pettigrew ( who resembled Neville Longbottom ) into a thousand pieces . 
" It has happened , My Lord … the Potters have made me their Secret - Keeper " and then came another voice , laughing shrilly , the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head whenever the Dementors drew near … " Harry , you — you look terrible . " 
He had awoken to find the dormitory deserted , dressed , and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for Ron , who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach , and Hermione , who had spread her homework over three tables . 
" Where is everyone ? " said Harry . 
It's the first day of the holidays , remember ? " said Ron , watching Harry closely . 
Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire . 
Snow was still falling outside the windows . 
Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large , ginger rug . 
" You really don't look well , you know , " Hermione said , peering anxiously into his face . 
" I'm fine , " said Harry . 
" Harry , listen , " said Hermione , exchanging a look with Ron , " you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday . 
But the thing is , you mustn't go doing anything stupid . " 
" Like what ? " said Harry . 
" Like trying to go after Black , " said Ron sharply . 
Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep . 
" You won't , will you , Harry ? " said Hermione . 
" Because Black's not worth dying for , " said Ron . 
Harry looked at them . 
They didn't seem to understand at all . 
" D ' you know what I see and hear every time a Dementor gets too near me ? " Ron and Hermione shook their heads , looking apprehensive . 
" I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort . 
And if you'd heard your mum screaming like that , just about to be killed , you wouldn't forget it in a hurry . 
And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her — " " There's nothing you can do ! " said Hermione , looking stricken . 
" The Dementors will catch Black and he ' ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right ! " " You heard what Fudge said . 
It's not a punishment for him like it is for the others . " 
" You want to — to kill Black or something ? " 
" Don't be silly , " said Hermione in a panicky voice . 
" Harry doesn't want to kill anyone , do you , Harry ? " Again , Harry didn't answer . 
He didn't know what he wanted to do . 
All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing , while Black was at liberty , was almost more than he could stand . 
" Malfoy knows , " he said abruptly . 
' If it was me , I'd hunt him down myself … I'd want revenge . ' " 
" You ' re going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours ? " said Ron furiously . 
" Listen … you know what Pettigrew's mother got back after Black had finished with him ? 
Black's a madman , Harry , and he's dangerous — " " Malfoy's dad must have told him , " said Harry , ignoring Ron . 
interjected Ron angrily . 
" — so obviously , the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort — " " — and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces , like Pettigrew ! 
Black did a terrible , terrible thing , but d - don't put yourself in danger , it's what Black wants … Oh , Harry , you'd be playing right into Black's hands if you went looking for him . 
They'd never want you to go looking for Black ! " 
" I ' ll never know what they'd have wanted , because thanks to Black , I ' ve never spoken to them , " said Harry shortly . 
Ron's pocket quivered . 
It's nearly Christmas ! 
Let's — let's go down and see Hagrid . 
So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole ( " Stand and fight , you yellow - bellied mongrels ! " ) , down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors . 
They made their way slowly down the lawn , making a shallow trench in the glittering , powdery snow , their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing . 
The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted , each tree smattered with silver , and Hagrid's cabin looked like an iced cake . 
Ron knocked , but there was no answer . 
Ron had his ear to the door . 
" There's a weird noise , " he said . 
" Listen — is that Fang ? " Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too . 
From inside the cabin came a series of low , throbbing moans . 
" Hagrid ! " called Harry , thumping the door . 
" Hagrid , are you in there ? " 
There was a sound of heavy footsteps , then the door creaked open . 
Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen , tears splashing down the front of his leather vest . 
Harry , about to collapse under Hagrid's weight , was rescued by Ron and Hermione , who each seized Hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin . 
" Hagrid , what is it ? " said Hermione , aghast . 
Harry spotted an official - looking letter lying open on the table . 
" What's this , Hagrid ? " Hagrid's sobs redoubled , but he shoved the letter toward Harry , who picked it up and read aloud : Dear Mr . Hagrid , Further to our inquiry into the attack by a Hippogriff on a student in your class , we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident . 
" Well , that's okay then , Hagrid ! " said Ron , clapping Hagrid on the shoulder . 
But Hagrid continued to sob , and waved one of his gigantic hands , inviting Harry to read on . 
However , we must register our concern about the Hippogriff in question . 
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr . Lucius Malfoy , and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . 
The hearing will take place on April 20 th , and we ask you to present yourself and your Hippogriff at the Committee's offices in London on that date . 
In the meantime , the Hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated . 
Yours in fellowship … There followed a list of the school governors . 
" Oh , " said Ron . " But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad Hippogriff , Hagrid . 
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry , Ron , and Hermione whip around . 
Buckbeak the Hippogriff was lying in the corner , chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor . 
" I couldn ' leave him tied up out there in the snow ! " choked Hagrid . 
" All on his own ! 
At Christmas . " 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at one another . 
They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called ' interesting creatures ' and other people called ' terrifying monsters . ' 
On the other hand , there didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak . 
" I'm sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe . " 
sobbed Hagrid . 
Scared o ' him ! 
Ad if I lose the case , Buckbeak — " Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat , then gave a great wail and lurched forward , his face in his arms . 
" What about Dumbledore , Hagrid ? " said Harry . 
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry , as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black . 
But Harry couldn't bring himself to do it , not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared . 
Hermione's right , you just need a good defense . 
I ' ll look it up for you , Hagrid , and see exactly what happened . " 
Hagrid howled still more loudly . 
Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them . 
" Er — shall I make a cup of tea ? " said Ron . 
Harry stared at him . 
" It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset , " Ron muttered , shrugging . 
At last , after many more assurances of help , with a steaming mug of tea in front of him , Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said , " Yer right . 
I can ' afford to go ter pieces . 
Gotta pull meself together … " Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on Hagrid's knee . 
" I ' ve not bin meself lately , " said Hagrid , stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other . 
" Yeah , they ' re great ! " said Ron , crossing his fingers under the table . 
" Dead , " said Hagrid gloomily . 
" Oh no ! " said Ron , his lip twitching . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione watched him breathlessly . 
They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before . 
After a pause , Hermione said timidly , " Is it awful in there , Hagrid ? " " Yeh ' ve no idea , " said Hagrid quietly . 
" Never bin anywhere like it . 
Thought I was goin ' mad . 
Kep ' goin ' over horrible stuff in me mind … the day I got expelled from Hogwarts … day me dad died … day I had ter let Norbert go … " His eyes filled with tears . 
Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards . 
I used ter hope I'd jus'die in me sleep . 
When they let me out , it was like bein ' born again , ev ' rythin ' came floodin ' back , it was the bes ' feelin ' in the world . 
Hagrid snorted . 
" Think that matters to them ? 
Hagrid went quiet for a moment , staring into his tea . 
An ' — an ' I'm scared o ' breakin'the law … " He looked up at them , tears leaking down his face again . 
The trip to Hagrid's , though far from fun , had nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had hoped . 
Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black , he couldn't brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . 
He , Ron , and Hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak . 
The three of them sat in front of the roaring fire , slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts , speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant . 
" Here's something … there was a case in 1722 … but the Hippogriff was convicted — ugh , look what they did to it , that's disgusting — " 
" This might help , look — a Manticore savaged someone in 1296 , and they let the Manticore off — oh — no , that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it … " Meanwhile , in the rest of the castle , the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up , despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them . 
Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors , mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor , and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas trees , glittering with golden stars . 
A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors , and by Christmas Eve , it had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air . 
On Christmas morning , Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him . 
Harry reached for his glasses and put them on , squinting through the semi - darkness to the foot of his bed , where a small heap of parcels had appeared . 
" Another sweater from Mum … maroon again … see if you ' ve got one . " 
Harry had . 
Mrs . Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front , also a dozen home - baked mince pies , some Christmas cake , and a box of nut brittle . 
As he moved all these things aside , he saw a long , thin package lying underneath . 
Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look . 
" I don't believe it , " he said hoarsely . 
It was a Firebolt , identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley . 
He could feel it vibrating and let go ; it hung in midair , unsupported , at exactly the right height for him to mount it . 
His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle , right down to the perfectly smooth , streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail . 
" Who sent it to you ? " said Ron in a hushed voice . 
" Look and see if there's a card , " said Harry . 
" Nothing ! 
" Dumbledore was just passing it on to me . 
This is an international standard broom , this is ! " " I can't believe this , " Harry muttered , running a hand along the Firebolt , while Ron sank onto Harry's bed , laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy . 
" Who — ? " " I know , " said Ron , controlling himself , " I know who it could ' ve been — Lupin ! " " What ? " said Harry , now starting to laugh himself " Lupin ? 
" Yeah , but he likes you , " said Ron . " And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed , and he might ' ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you — " " What d ' you mean , he was away ? " said Harry . 
" He was ill when I was playing in that match . " 
" Don't bring him in here ! " said Ron , hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket . 
She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's empty bed and stared , open - mouthed , at the Firebolt . 
" Oh , Harry ! 
Who sent you that ? " " No idea , " said Harry . 
On the contrary , her face fell , and she bit her lip . 
" What's the matter with you ? " said Ron . 
" I don't know , " said Hermione slowly , " but it's a bit odd , isn't it ? 
I mean , this is supposed to be quite a good broom , isn't it ? " 
Ron sighed exasperatedly . 
" It's the best broom there is , Hermione , " he said . 
" Who cares ? " said Ron impatiently . 
" Listen , Harry , can I have a go on it ? 
Can I ? " " I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet ! " said Hermione shrilly . 
Harry and Ron looked at her . " What d ' you think Harry's going to do with it — sweep the floor ? " said Ron . 
But before Hermione could answer , Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed , right at Ron's chest . 
Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed , knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down , howling with pain . 
Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end . 
" I forgot about that ! " 
Harry said , bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope . 
Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it . 
" Can't you shut that thing up ? " he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room , Crookshanks's yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron . 
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk . 
Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands . 
" He's not looking too good , is he ? " Harry said . 
But Harry , remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years , couldn't help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed , he was reaching the end of his life . 
And despite Ron's frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless , he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died . 
Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning . 
Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory , but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him ; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers . 
Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt , which he had brought down to the common room with him . 
At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall , to find that the House tables had been moved against the walls again , and that a single table , set for twelve , stood in the middle of the room . 
Professors Dumbledore , McGonagall , Snape , Sprout , and Flitwick were there , along with Filch , the caretaker , who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldylooking tailcoat . 
" Merry Christmas ! " said Dumbledore as Harry , Ron , and Hermione approached the table . 
" As there are so few of us , it seemed foolish to use the House tables … Sit down , sit down ! " Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table . 
With a bang like a gunshot , the cracker flew apart to reveal a large , pointed witches hat topped with a stuffed vulture . 
Harry , remembering the Boggart , caught Ron's eye and they both grinned ; Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore , who swapped it for his wizard's hat at once . 
" Dig in ! " he advised the table , beaming around . 
As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes , the doors of the Great Hall opened again . 
It was Professor Trelawney , gliding toward them as though on wheels . 
She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion , making her look more than ever like a glittering , oversized dragonfly . 
" Sybill , this is a pleasant surprise ! " said Dumbledore , standing up . 
" I have been crystal gazing , Headmaster , " said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest , most faraway voice , " and to my astonishment , I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you . 
Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate ? 
I at once hastened from my tower , and I do beg you to forgive my lateness … " " Certainly , certainly , " said Dumbledore , his eyes twinkling . 
" Let me draw you up a chair — " And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand , which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall . 
Professor Trelawney , however , did not sit down ; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table , and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream . 
" I dare not , Headmaster ! 
If I join the table , we shall be thirteen ! 
Never forget that when thirteen dine together , the first to rise will be the first to die ! " " We ' ll risk it , Sybill , " said Professor McGonagall impatiently . 
" Do sit down , the turkey's getting stone cold . " 
Professor Trelawney hesitated , then lowered herself into the empty chair , eyes shut and mouth clenched tight , as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table . 
" Tripe , Sybill ? " Professor Trelawney ignored her . 
Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look . 
" Certainly I knew , Minerva , " she said quietly . 
" But one does not parade the fact that one is AllKnowing . 
I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye , so as not to make others nervous . " 
" That explains a great deal , " said Professor McGonagall tartly . 
Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty . 
" If you must know , Minerva , I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long . 
He seems aware , himself , that his time is short . 
" I doubt , " said Dumbledore , in a cheerful but slightly raised voice , which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's conversation , " that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger . 
" Yes , Headmaster , " said Snape . 
Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of Christmas dinner , two hours later . 
Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats , Harry and Ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly . 
Which ? " " Dunno , " said Ron , looking uneasily at Harry . 
" I doubt it will make much difference , " said Professor McGonagall coldly , " unless a mad axeman is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the Entrance Hall . " 
Even Ron laughed . 
Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted . 
Harry said to Hermione . 
" No , " Hermione muttered . 
When they reached the portrait hole they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas part with a couple of monks , several previous headmasters of Hogwarts and his fat pony . 
" Merry — hic — Christmas ! 
Password ? " 
" Scurvy cur , " said Ron . " And the same to you , sir ! " roared Sir Cadogan , as the painting swung forward to admit them . 
Harry went straight up to the dormitory , collected his Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday , brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do with the Firebolt ; however , there where no bent twigs to clip , and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it . 
He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle , until the portrait hole opened , and Hermione came in , accompanied by Professor McGonagall . 
Though Professor McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor House , Harry had only seen her in the common room once before , and that had been to make a very grave announcement . 
Hermione walked around them , sat down , picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it . 
" So that's it , is it ? " said Professor McGonagall beadily , walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt . 
Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione . 
They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book , which was upside - down . 
" Hmm . 
No card ? 
" No , " said Harry blankly . 
" I see … " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Well , I'm afraid I will have to take this , Potter . " 
" W — what ? " said Harry , scrambling to his feet . 
" Why ? " " It will need to be checked for jinxes , " said Professor McGonagall . 
repeated Ron , as though Professor McGonagall was mad . 
" It shouldn't take more than a few weeks , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx - free . " 
" Honestly , Professor — " " You can't know that , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall , quite kindly , " not until you ' ve flown it , at any rate , and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with . 
I shall keep you informed . " 
Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole , which closed behind her . 
Harry stood staring after her , the tin of High - Finish Polish still clutched in his hands . 
Ron , however , rounded on Hermione . 
" What did you go running to McGonagall for ? " 
Hermione threw her book aside . 
She was still pink in the face , but stood up and faced Ron defiantly . 
" Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black ! " 
He had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours , and now , because of her interference , he didn't know whether he would ever see it again . 
He was positive that there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now , but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti - jinx tests ? 
Ron was furious with Hermione too . 
As far as he was concerned , the stripping - down of a brandnew Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage . 
Hermione , who remained convinced that she had acted for the best , started avoiding the common room . 
Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back . 
All in all , they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after New Year , and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again . 
After last match , you know . 
If the Dementors come to the next one … I mean … we can't afford you to — well — " Wood broke off , looking awkward . 
" I'm working on it , " said Harry quickly . 
He said he'd have time after Christmas . " 
" Ah , " said Wood , his expression clearing . 
" Well , in that case — I really didn't want to lose you as Seeker , Harry . 
And have you ordered a new broom yet ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" What ! 
No ! Seriously ? 
A — a real Firebolt ? " 
" Don't get excited , Oliver , " said Harry gloomily . 
" I haven't got it anymore . 
It was confiscated . " 
" Sirius Black , " Harry said wearily . 
" He's supposed to be after me . 
Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his Seeker , Wood said , " But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt ! 
He's on the run ! 
" I ' ll go and talk to her , Harry , " he promised . 
The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning , but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment , and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame - loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling , white - hot logs . 
The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun ; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry , and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen . 
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to ; after his conversation with Wood , he wanted to get started on his anti - Dementor lessons as soon as possible . 
" Ah yes , " said Lupin , when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class . 
" Let me see … how about eight o ' clock on Thursday evening ? 
The History of Magic classroom should be large enough … I ' ll have to think carefully about how we ' re going to do this … We can't bring a real Dementor into the castle to practice on … " " Still looks ill , doesn't he ? " said Ron as they walked down the corridor , heading to dinner . 
It was Hermione , who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor , repacking her bag , which was so full of books it wouldn't close . 
" Nothing , " said Hermione in a lofty voice , heaving her bag back over her shoulder . 
" Fine , " said Hermione haughtily , and she marched off . 
" She's just trying to get us to talk to her again . " 
At eight o ' clock on Thursday evening , Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom . 
" What's that ? " said Harry . 
It's the nearest we ' ll get to a real Dementor . 
The Boggart will turn into a Dementor when he sees you , so we ' ll be able to practice on him . 
" Okay , " said Harry , trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real Dementor . 
" The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic , Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level . 
It is called the Patronus Charm . " 
" How does it work ? " said Harry nervously . 
" Well , when it works correctly , It conjures up a Patronus , " said Lupin , " which is a kind of antiDementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the Dementor . " 
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid - sized figure holding a large club . 
Professor Lupin continued , " The Patronus is a kind of positive force , a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon — hope , happiness , the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair , as real humans can , so the Dementors can't hurt it . 
But I must warn you , Harry , that the charm might be too advanced for you . 
" What does a Patronus look like ? " said Harry curiously . 
" And how do you conjure it ? " 
" With an incantation , which will work only if you are concentrating , with all your might , on a single , very happy memory . " 
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory . 
Certainly , nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys ' was going to do . 
Finally , he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick . 
" The incantation is this — " Lupin cleared his throat . 
" Expecto patronum ! " 
" Expecto patronum , " Harry repeated under his breath , " expecto patronum . " 
" Did you see that ? " said Harry excitedly . 
" Something happened ! " 
" Very good , " said Lupin , smiling . 
" Right , then — ready to try it on a Dementor ? " 
" Yes , " Harry said , gripping his wand very tightly , and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom . 
He tried to keep his mind on flying , but something else kept intruding … Any second now , he might hear his mother again … but he shouldn't think that , or he would hear her again , and he didn't want to … or did he ? 
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled . 
The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out . 
The Dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry , drawing a deep , rattling breath . 
Harry yelled . 
" Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto — " But the classroom and the Dementor were dissolving … Harry was falling again through thick white fog , and his mother's voice was louder than ever , echoing inside his head — " Not Harry ! 
Not Harry ! 
Harry jerked back to life . 
He was lying flat on his back on the floor . 
He didn't have to ask what had happened . 
" Sorry , " he muttered , sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses . 
" Are you all right ? " said Lupin . 
" Yes … " Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it . 
" I ' ve got to ! 
I can't afford to fall off again . 
If we lose this game we ' ve lost the Quidditch Cup ! " " All right then … " said Lupin . 
He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom . 
" Ready , " said Harry ; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning , and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened . 
The room went icily cold and dark once more . 
Harry yelled . 
" Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto Pat — " White fog obscured his senses … big , blurred shapes were moving around him … then came a new voice , a man's voice , shouting , panicking — " Lily , take Harry and go ! 
It's him ! 
Go ! Run ! I ' ll hold him off — " The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a door bursting open — a cackle of high - pitched laughter — " Harry ! 
Harry … wake up … " Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face . 
This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor . 
" I heard my dad , " Harry mumbled . 
" That's the first time I ' ve ever heard him — he tried to take on Voldemort himself , to give my mum time to run for it … " 
Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat . 
" You heard James ? " said Lupin in a strange voice . 
" Yeah … " Face dry , Harry looked up . 
" Why — you didn't know my dad , did you ? " " I — I did , as a matter of fact , " said Lupin . 
" We were friends at Hogwarts . 
Listen , Harry — perhaps we should leave it here for tonight . 
He got up again . 
" I ' ll have one more go ! 
All right — go ! " 
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time , and the Dementor rose out of it ; the room fell cold and dark — " EXPECTO PATRONUM ! " 
Harry bellowed . 
" EXPECTO PATRONUM ! 
EXPECTO PATRONUM ! " 
The screaming inside Harry's head had started again — except this time , it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder and softer again … and he could still see the Dementor … it had halted … and then a huge , silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand , to hover between him and the Dementor , and though Harry's legs felt like water , he was still on his feet — though for how much longer , he wasn't sure … " Riddikulus ! " 
There was a loud crack , and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the Dementor ; he sank into a chair , feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile , and felt his legs shaking . 
Out of the corner of his eye , he saw Professor Lupin forcing the Boggart back into the packing case with his wand ; it had turned into a silvery orb again . 
" Excellent ! " Lupin said , striding over to where Harry sat . " Excellent , Harry ! 
Just one more go ? " 
Here — " He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes ' best chocolate . 
" Okay , " said Harry . 
He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the Dementor . 
" Professor Lupin ? " he said . 
" If you knew my dad , you must ' ve known Sirius Black as well . " 
" Nothing — I mean , I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too … " Lupin's face relaxed . 
" Yes , I knew him , " he said shortly . 
" Or I thought I did . 
You'd better be off , Harry , it's getting late . " 
Harry left the classroom , walking along the corridor and around a corner , then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate , wishing he hadn't mentioned Black , as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject . 
Then Harry's thoughts wandered back to his mother and father … He felt drained and strangely empty , even though he was so full of chocolate . 
Terrible though it was to hear his parents ' last moments replayed inside his head , these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child . 
But he'd never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again … " They're dead , " he told himself sternly . 
He stood up , crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth , and headed back to Gryffindor Tower . 
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term . 
According to Wood , this was good news for Gryffindor , who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too . 
He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week . 
This meant that with Lupin's anti - Dementor classes , which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices , Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework . 
Even so , he was not showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione , whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her . 
Every night , without fail , Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room , several tables spread with books , Arithmancy charts , rune dictionaries , diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects , and file upon file of extensive notes ; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted . 
" How's she doing it ? " 
Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape . 
Harry looked up . 
Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books . 
Ron said . 
" I heard her talking to Professor Vector , that Arithmancy witch , this morning . 
Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible schedule at the moment ; he really needed to get on with Snape's essay . 
Two seconds later , however , he was interrupted again , this time by Wood . 
" Bad news , Harry . 
I ' ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt . 
Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive . 
Just because I told her I didn't care if it threw you off , as long as you caught the Snitch first . " 
Wood shook his head in disbelief . 
" As long as necessary , Wood " … I reckon it's time you ordered a new broom , Harry . 
January faded imperceptibly into February , with no change in the bitterly cold weather . 
" We ' ve checked for most of the usual curses , but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex . 
I shall tell you once we ' ve finished checking it . 
Now , please stop badgering me . " 
To make matters even worse , Harry's anti - Dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped . 
Several sessions on , he was able to produce an indistinct , silvery shadow every time the Boggart - Dementor approached him , but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the Dementor away . 
All it did was hover , like a semitransparent cloud , draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there . 
Harry felt angry with himself , guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents ' voices again . 
" For a thirteen - year - old wizard , even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement . 
" I thought a Patronus would — charge the Dementors down or something , " said Harry dispiritedly . 
" But you ' ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . 
If the Dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match , you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground . " 
" You said it's harder if there are loads of them , " said Harry . 
" I have complete confidence in you , " said Lupin , smiling . 
" Butterbeer ! " said Harry , without thinking . 
" Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade , " Harry lied quickly . 
" I see , " said Lupin , though he still looked slightly suspicious . 
" Well — let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw ! 
They drank the butterbeer in silence , until Harry voiced something he'd been wondering for a while . 
" Hmmm … well , the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us . 
You see , the Dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon . " 
" What's that ? " " They call it the Dementor's Kiss , " said Lupin , with a slightly twisted smile . 
" It's what Dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly . 
I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there , because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his soul . " 
Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer . 
" What — they kill — ? " " Oh no , " said Lupin . 
" Much worse than that . 
You can exist without your soul , you know , as long as your brain and heart are still working . 
But you ' ll have no sense of self anymore , no memory , no … anything . 
There's no chance at all of recovery . 
You ' ll just exist . 
And your soul is gone forever … lost . " 
Lupin drank a little more butterbeer , then said , " It's the fate that awaits Sirius Black . 
It was in the Daily Prophet this morning . 
Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth . 
But then he thought of Black . 
" He deserves it , " he said suddenly . 
" Do you really think anyone deserves that ? " " Yes , " said Harry defiantly . 
So he finished his butterbeer , thanked Lupin , and left the History of Magic classroom . 
Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a Dementor's hood , the answer had been so horrible , and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs . 
Harry's jaw dropped . 
She was holding out his Firebolt , and it looked as magnificent as ever . 
" I can have it back ? " 
Harry said weakly . 
" Seriously ? " " Seriously , " said Professor McGonagall , and she was actually smiling . 
" I daresay you ' ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match , won't you ? 
Or we ' ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row , as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night … " Speechless , Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower . 
" She gave it to you ? Excellent ! 
Listen , can I still have a go on it ? 
Tomorrow ? " 
" You know what — we should make up with Hermione … She was only trying to help … " " Yeah , all right , " said Ron . " She's in the common room now working — for a change . " 
They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom , pleading with Sir Cadogan , who seemed to be refusing him entrance . 
" I wrote them down ! " Neville was saying tearfully . 
" A likely tale ! " roared Sir Cadogan . 
Come clap this loon in irons . 
He is trying to force entry to the chambers within ! " " Oh , shut up , " said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville . 
" I ' ve lost the passwords ! " 
" I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week , because he keeps changing them , and now I don't know what I ' ve done with them ! " " Oddsbodkins , " said Harry to Sir Cadogan , who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room . 
" Where'd you get it , Harry ? " " Will you let me have a go ? " " Have you ridden it yet , Harry ? " " Ravenclaw ' ll have no chance , they ' re all on Cleansweep Sevens ! " " Can I just hold it , Harry ? " 
After ten minutes or so , during which the Firebolt was Passed around and admired from every angle , the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione , the only person who hadn't rushed over to them , bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes . 
Harry and Ron approached her table and at last , she looked up . 
" I got it back , " said Harry , grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt . 
" See , Hermione ? 
There wasn't anything wrong with it ! " said Ron . " Well — there might have been ! " said Hermione . 
" I mean , at least you know now that it's safe ! " " Yeah , I suppose so , " said Harry . 
" I'd better put it upstairs . " 
" I ' ll take it ! " said Ron eagerly . 
He took the Firebolt and , holding it as if it were made of glass , carried it away up the boys'staircase . 
" Can I sit down , then ? " 
Harry asked Hermione . 
" I suppose so , " said Hermione , moving a great stack of parchment off a chair . 
Harry looked around at the cluttered table , at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening , at the even longer Muggle Studies essay ( ' Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity ' ) and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over . 
" How are you getting through all this stuff ? " 
Harry asked her . 
" Oh , well — you know — working hard , " said Hermione . 
Close - up , Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin . 
" Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects ? " 
" I couldn't do that ! " said Hermione , looking scandalized . 
" Oh no , it's wonderful ! " said Hermione earnestly . 
" It's my favorite subject ! 
It's — " But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy , Harry never found out . 
The whole common room fell silent , staring , petrified , at the entrance . 
" LOOK ! " he bellowed , striding over to Hermione's table . 
" Ron , what — ? " " SCABBERS ! 
Hermione was leaning away from Ron , looking utterly bewildered . 
Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding . 
There was something red on it . 
Something that looked horribly like - 
Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation . 
Hermione and Harry leaned forward . 
It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship . 
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to eat Scabbers seriously , hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him , and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys ' beds . 
Hermione , meanwhile , maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers , that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas , and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical Menagerie . 
Personally , Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers , and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way , she lost her temper with Harry too . " Okay , side with Ron , I knew you would ! " she said shrilly . 
" First the Firebolt , now Scabbers , everything's my fault , isn't it ! 
Just leave me alone , Harry , I ' ve got a lot of work to do ! " Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed . 
" Come on , Ron , you were always saying how boring Scabbers was , " said Fred bracingly . 
" Fred ! " said Ginny indignantly . 
" All he did was eat and sleep , Ron , you said it yourself , " said George . 
" He bit Goyle for us once ! " Ron said miserably . 
" Remember , Harry ? " " Yeah , that's true , " said Harry . 
" Let the scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory . 
In a last - ditch attempt to cheer Ron up , Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw match , so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd finished . 
Can I try and shoot a few goals on it ? " ) 
Madam Hooch , who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry , was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been . 
She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion . 
" Look at the balance on it ! 
If the Nimbus series has a fault , it's a slight list to the tail end — you often find they develop a drag after a few years . 
They ' ve updated the handle too , a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps , reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they ' ve stopped making them . 
We need to practice … " " Oh — right — here you are , then , Potter , " said Madam Hooch . 
" I ' ll sit over here with Weasley … " She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium , and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow's match . 
It's Cho Chang . 
She's a fourth year , and she's pretty good … I really hoped she wouldn't be fit , she's had some problems with injuries … " Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery , then said , " On the other hand , she rides a Comet Two Sixty , which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt . " 
It was better than he'd ever dreamed . 
The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch ; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip ; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green - and - gray blur ; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed , then he went into a perfectly controlled dive , brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty , forty , fifty feet into the air again — " Harry , I'm letting the Snitch out ! " Wood called . 
Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts ; he outstripped it easily , saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood , and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand . 
The team cheered madly . 
Harry let the Snitch go again , gave it a minute's head start , then tore after it , weaving in and out of the others ; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee , looped her easily , and caught it again . 
It was the best practice ever ; the team , inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst , performed their best moves faultlessly , and by the time they hit the ground again , Wood didn't have a single criticism to make , which , as George Weasley pointed out , was a first . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger . 
Dumbledore'd go ballistic , " said Fred confidently . 
Let's get back to the tower … turn in early … " " I'm staying out for a bit ; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt , " Harry told Wood , and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms , Harry strode over to Ron , who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him . 
" Here you go , " said Harry , handing Ron the Firebolt . 
Ron , an expression of ecstasy on his face , mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field , watching him . 
Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start , told Harry and Ron off for not waking her , and insisted that they go back to the castle . 
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium , discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action , its phenomenal acceleration , and its pinpoint turning . 
They were halfway toward the castle when Harry , glancing to his left , saw something that made his heart turn over — a pair of eyes , gleaming out of the darkness . 
Harry stopped dead , his heart banging against his ribs . 
" What's the matter ? " said Ron . 
Harry pointed . 
Ron pulled out his wand and muttered , " Lumos ! " 
A beam of light fell across the grass , hit the bottom of a tree , and illuminated its branches ; there , crouching among the budding leaves , was Crookshanks . 
" Get out of here ! " 
Ron roared , and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass , but before he could do anything else , Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail . 
" See ? " Ron said furiously , chucking the stone down again . 
slightly ashamed of his moment of panic , Harry didn't say anything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hall . 
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory , all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor . 
As Harry entered the Great 
Hall , heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt , and there was a good deal of excited muttering . 
" He can't believe it ! 
This is brilliant ! " 
Wood , too , was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt . 
" Put it here , Harry , " he said , laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward . 
People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look . 
Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus , and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend , Penelope Clearwater , asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt . 
" Penelope and I have got a bet on , " he told the team . 
" Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match ! " 
Penelope put the Firebolt down again , thanked Harry , and went back to her table . 
" Harry — make sure you win , " said Percy , in an urgent whisper . 
" I haven't got ten Galleons . 
Yes , I'm coming , Penny ! " 
And he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast . 
Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look , Crabbe and Goyle right behind him . 
" Yeah , reckon so , " said Harry casually . 
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered . 
" Then it could catch the Snitch for you . " 
Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed , and he stalked away . 
They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team , who put their heads together , no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's broom really was a Firebolt . 
At a quarter to eleven , the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms . 
It was a clear , cool day with a very light breeze ; there would be no visibility problems this time , and Harry , though nervous , was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring . 
They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond . 
Harry took off his black school robes , removed his wand from his pocket , and stuck it inside the T - shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes . 
He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd , watching . 
" You know what we ' ve got to do , " said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms . 
" If we lose this match , we ' re out of the running , just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday , and we ' ll be okay ! " 
They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause . 
The Ravenclaw team , dressed in blue , were already standing in the middle of the field . 
Their Seeker , Cho Chang , was the only girl on their team . 
She was shorter than Harry by about a head , and Harry couldn't help noticing , nervous as he was , that she was extremely pretty . 
She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains , and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves . 
" Wood , Davies , shake hands , " Madam Hooch said briskly , and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain . 
" Mount your brooms … on my whistle … three — two — one — " Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom ; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch , listening all the while to the commentary , which was being provided by the Weasley twins ' friend Lee Jordan . 
" They're off , and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor . 
According to Which Broomstick , the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year's World Championship — " " Jordan , would you mind telling us what's going on in the match ? " interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice . 
" Right you are , Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt , incidentally , has a built - in auto - brake and — " " Jordan ! " " Okay , okay , Gryffindor in possession , Katie Bell of Gryffindor , heading for goal … " Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction , gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely . 
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind . 
Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match , and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild , he saw it — the Snitch was close to the ground , flitting near one of the barriers . 
Harry dived ; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him — Harry was speeding up , excitement flooding him ; dives were his specialty , he was ten feet away — Then a Bludger , hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters , came pelting out of nowhere ; Harry veered off course , avoiding it by an inch , and in those few , crucial seconds , the Snitch had vanished . 
There was a great " Ooooooh " of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters , but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end . 
George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater , who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it . 
" Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero , and look at that Firebolt go ! Potter's really putting it through its paces now , see it turn — Chang's Comet is just no match for it , the Firebolt's precision — balance is really noticeable in these long — " " JORDAN ! 
Harry dropped lower , narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser , scanning the field frantically — a glint of gold , a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post … Harry accelerated , eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead — but just then , Cho appeared out of thin air , blocking him — " HARRY , THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN ! " Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision . 
The Snitch had vanished again . 
Out of the corner of his eye , he saw Cho following him … She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself … All right , then … if she wanted to tail him , she'd have to take the consequences … He dived again , and Cho , thinking he'd seen the Snitch , tried to follow ; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply ; she hurtled downward ; he rose fast as a bullet once more , and then saw it , for the third time — the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end . 
Distracted , Harry looked down . 
He didn't stop to think . 
Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes , he whipped out his wand and roared , " Expecto patronum ! " 
Something silver - white , something enormous , erupted from the end of his wand . 
He knew it had shot directly at the Dementors but didn't pause to watch ; his mind still miraculously clear , he looked ahead — he was nearly there . 
He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small , struggling Snitch . 
Madam Hooch's whistle sounded . 
Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd . 
Alicia , Angelina , and Katie had all kissed Harry ; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off . 
In complete disarray , the team managed to make its way back to the ground . 
Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field , Ron in the lead . 
" Yes ! " Ron yelled , yanking Harry's arm into the air . 
" Yes ! 
Yes ! " " Well done , Harry ! " said Percy , looking delighted . 
" Ten Galleons to me ! Must find Penelope , excuse me — " " Good for you , Harry ! " roared Seamus Finnigan . 
boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors . 
" That was quite some Patronus , " said a voice in Harry's ear . 
Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin , who looked both shaken and pleased . 
" Come and see — " He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field . 
" You gave Mr . Malfoy quite a fright , " said Lupin . 
Harry stared . 
Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy , Crabbe , Goyle , and Marcus Flint , the Slytherin team Captain , all struggling to remove themselves from long , black , hooded robes . 
" A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker ! 
If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory , it was this . 
Ron , who had fought his way through to Harry's side , doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe , Goyle's head still stuck inside it . 
" Come on , Harry ! " said George , fighting his way over . 
Gryffindor common room , now ! " " Right , " said Harry , and feeling happier than he had in ages , he and the rest of the team led the way , still in their scarlet robes , out of the stadium and back up to the castle . 
It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup ; the party went on all day and well into the night . 
Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer , pumpkin fizz , and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets . 
" How did you do that ? " 
squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd . 
" With a little help from Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs , " Fred muttered in Harry's ear . 
Hermione , incredibly , was sitting in a corner , attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles . 
Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her . " Did you even come to the match ? " he asked her . 
" Of course I did , " said Hermione in a strangely high - pitched voice , not looking up . 
" And I'm very glad we won , and I think you did really well , but I need to read this by Monday . " 
" Come on , Hermione , come and have some food , " Harry said , looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet . 
" I can't , Harry . 
I ' ve still got four hundred and twenty - two pages to read ! " said Hermione , now sounding slightly hysterical . 
" Anyway … " She glanced over at Ron too . 
He used to really like them — " Hermione burst into tears . 
Before Harry could say or do anything , she tucked the enormous book under her arm , and , still sobbing , ran toward the staircase to the girls'dormitories and out of sight . 
" Can't you give her a break ? " 
Harry asked Ron quietly . 
" No , " said Ron flatly . 
" If she just acted like she was sorry — but she ' ll never admit she's wrong , Hermione . 
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning , to insist that they all go to bed . 
Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory , still discussing the match . 
He was walking through a forest , his Firebolt over his shoulder , following something silvery - white . 
It was winding its way through the trees ahead , and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves . 
Then he turned a corner into a clearing and — " AAARRGGHH ! 
NOOO ! " Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face . 
Disoriented in the total darkness , he fumbled with his hangings , he could hear movements around him , and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of the room . 
" What's going on ? " 
Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam . 
At last finding the divide in his curtains , he ripped them back , and at the same moment , Dean Thomas lit his lamp . 
Ron was sitting up in bed , the hangings torn from one side , a look of utmost terror on his face . 
" Black ! 
Sirius Black ! 
With a knife ! " " What ? " " Here ! 
Just now ! 
Slashed the curtains ! 
Woke me up ! " " You sure you weren't dreaming , Ron ? " said Dean . " Look at the curtains ! 
I tell you , he was here ! " 
They all scrambled out of bed ; Harry reached the dormitory door first , and they sprinted back down the staircase . 
Doors opened behind them , and sleepy voices called after them . 
" Who shouted ? " " What ' re you doing ? " 
The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire , still littered with the debris from the party . 
It was deserted . 
" Are you sure you weren't dreaming , Ron ? " " I'm telling you , I saw him ! " " What's all the noise ? " " Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed ! " A few of the girls had come down their staircase , pulling on dressing gowns and yawning . 
" Excellent , are we carrying on ? " said Fred Weasley brightly . 
" Perce — Sirius Black ! " said Ron faintly . 
With a knife ! 
Woke me up ! " 
The common room went very still . 
" Nonsense ! " said Percy , looking startled . 
She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around . 
" I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match , but this is getting ridiculous ! 
Percy , I expected better of you ! " " I certainly didn't authorize this , Professor ! " said Percy , puffing himself up indignantly . 
" I was just telling them all to get back to bed ! My brother Ron here had a nightmare — " " IT WASN ' T A NIGHTMARE ! " Ron yelled . 
" Ask him if he saw — " 
Glaring suspiciously at Ron , Professor McGonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside . 
" Sir Cadogan , did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower ? " " Certainly , good lady ! " cried Sir Cadogan . 
There was a stunned silence , both inside and outside the common room . 
" You — you did ? " said Professor McGonagall . 
" But — but the password ! " 
" He had ' em ! " said Sir Cadogan proudly . 
Read ' em off a little piece of paper ! " Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd . 
She was white as chalk . 
Neville Longbottom , trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes , raised his hand slowly into the air . 
No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night . 
They knew that the castle was being searched again , and the whole House stayed awake in the common room , waiting to hear whether Black had been caught . 
Professor McGonagall came back at dawn , to tell them that he had again escaped . 
Throughout the day , everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security ; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black ; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors , boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes . 
His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor , and the Fat Lady was back . 
They paced the corridor in a menacing group , talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs . 
Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one - eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked . 
It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they — and now Harry , Ron , and Hermione — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it . 
" D ' you reckon we should tell someone ? " 
Harry asked Ron . 
" We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's , " said Ron dismissively . 
Harry was glad Ron took this view . 
If the one - eyed witch was boarded up too , he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again . 
For the first time in his life , people were paying more attention to him than to Harry , and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience . 
" … I was asleep , and I heard this ripping noise , and I thought it was in my dream , you know ? 
But then there was this draft … I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down … I rolled over … and I saw him standing over me … like a skeleton , with loads of filthy hair … holding this great long knife , must ' ve been twelve inches … and he looked at me , and I looked at him , and then I yelled , and he scampered . 
" Why , though ? " 
Ron added to Harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed . 
" Why did he run ? " 
Harry had been wondering the same thing . 
Why had Black , having got the wrong bed , not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry ? 
Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people , and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys , four of whom were asleep . 
" He'd ' ve had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole … then he would ' ve met the teachers … " Neville was in total disgrace . 
Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits , given him a detention , and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower . 
Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in , while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him . 
Two days after Black's break - in , she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast — a Howler . 
The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual , and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him , a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak . 
Harry and Ron , who were sitting opposite him , recognized the letter as a Howler at once — Ron had got one from his mother the year before . 
" Run for it , Neville , " Ron advised . 
He seized the envelope , and holding it before him like a bomb , sprinted out of the hall , while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him . 
They heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall — Neville's grandmother's voice , magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume , shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family . 
Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too . 
" Ouch ! 
Oh — thanks , Hedwig . " 
Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of Neville's cornflakes . 
The note inside said : Dear Harry and Ron , How about having tea with me this afternoon ' round six ? 
Cheers , Hagrid " He probably wants to hear all about Black ! " said Ron . 
So at six o ' clock that afternoon , Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower , passed the security trolls at a run , and headed down to the entrance hall . 
Hagrid was already waiting for them . 
" All right , Hagrid ! " said Ron . " S ' pose you want to hear about Saturday night , do you ? " 
" I ' ve already heard all abou ' it , " said Hagrid , opening the front doors and leading them outside . 
" Oh , " said Ron , looking slightly put out . 
The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak , who was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt , his enormous wings folded tight to his body , enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets . 
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight , Harry saw a gigantic , hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow - and - orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door . 
" What are they for , Hagrid ? " said Harry . 
" Buckbeak's case against the Committee fer the Disposal o ' Dangerous Creatures , " said Hagrid . 
I ' ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus … " Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt . 
He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak's trial was so near , and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's face , he had too . 
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept ; they had had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" Hermione , " said Hagrid . 
" What about her ? " said Ron . " She's in a righ'state , that's what . 
Ron interjected angrily . 
Goin'through a rough time at the moment . 
" I'm not blamin ' yeh ! " said Hagrid , waving Harry's apology aside . 
I ' ve seen yeh practicin ' Quidditch ev ' ry hour o ' the day an ' night — but I gotta tell yeh , I thought you two'd value yer friend more ' n broomsticks or rats . 
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks . 
She's got her heart in the right place , Hermione has , an ' you two not talkin'to her — " " If she'd just get rid of that cat , I'd speak to her again ! " 
Ron said angrily . 
" But she's still sticking up for it ! 
It's a maniac , and she won't hear a word against it ! " 
" Ah , well , people can be a bit stupid abou ' their pets , " said Hagrid wisely . 
They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved chances for the Quidditch Cup . 
At nine o ' clock , Hagrid walked them back up to the castle . 
A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room . 
" Hogsmeade , next weekend ! " said Ron , craning over the heads to read the new notice . 
" What d ' you reckon ? " he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down . 
" Harry ! " said a voice in his right ear . 
Harry started and looked around at Hermione , who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her . 
" Harry , if you go into Hogsmeade again … I ' ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map ! " said Hermione . 
" Can you hear someone talking , Harry ? " growled Ron , not looking at Hermione . 
" Ron , how can you let him go with you ? 
After what Sirius Black nearly did to you ! 
I mean it , I ' ll tell — " 
" So now you ' re trying to get Harry expelled ! " said Ron furiously . 
Hermione opened her mouth to respond , but with a soft hiss , Crookshanks leapt onto her lap . 
Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron's face , gathered up Crookshanks , and hurried away toward the girls'dormitories . 
" So how about it ? " 
Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption . 
You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet ! " 
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot . 
" Okay , " he said . 
" But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time . " 
On Saturday morning , Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag , slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket , and went down to breakfast with everyone else . 
Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him , but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors . 
Harry called to Ron . " See you when you get back ! " 
Ron grinned and winked . 
Harry hurried up to the third floor , slipping the Marauder's Map out of his pocket as he went . 
A tiny dot was moving in his direction . 
Harry squinted at it . 
The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom . 
Harry quickly pulled out his wand , muttered , " Dissendium ! " and shoved his bag into the statue , but before he could climb in himself , Neville came around the corner . 
" Harry ! 
I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either ! " " Hi , Neville , " said Harry , moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket . 
" What are you up to ? " " Nothing , " shrugged Neville . 
" Want a game of Exploding Snap ? " " Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin — " " I ' ll come with you ! " said Neville brightly . 
" I haven't done it either ! " 
" Er — hang on — yeah , I forgot , I finished it last night ! " 
" Great , you can help me ! " said Neville , his round face anxious . 
" I don't understand that thing about the garlic at all — do they have to eat it , or — " He broke off with a small gasp , looking over Harry's shoulder . 
It was Snape . 
Neville took a quick step behind Harry . 
" And what are you two doing here ? " said Snape , coming to a halt and looking from one to the other . 
" An odd place to meet — " To Harry's immense disquiet , Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them , and then to the one - eyed witch . 
" We're not — meeting here , " said Harry . 
" We just — met here . " 
" Indeed ? " said Snape . 
" You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places , Potter , and you are very rarely there for no good reason … I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower , where you belong . " 
Harry and Neville set off without another word . 
As they turned the corner , Harry looked back . 
Snape was running one of his hands over the one - eyed witch's head , examining it closely . 
Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password , then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back . 
Once out of sight of the security trolls , he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose . 
Harry scanned the map carefully and saw , with a leap of relief , that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office . 
He sprinted back to the one - eyed witch , opened her hump , heaved himself inside , and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute . 
Harry , completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak , emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back . 
" It's me , " he muttered . 
" What kept you ? " Ron hissed . 
" Snape was hanging around . " 
" Where are you ? " 
Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth . 
" Are you still there ? 
This feels weird … " They went to the post office ; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around . 
George's wildest dreams ; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak . 
The day was fine and breezy , and neither of them felt like staying indoors , so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack , the most haunted dwelling in Britain . 
It stood a little way above the rest of the village , and even in daylight was slightly creepy , with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden . 
" Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it , " said Ron as they leaned on the fence , looking up at it . 
" I asked Nearly Headless Nick … he says he's heard a very rough crowd lives here . 
No one can get in . 
Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill ; moments later , Malfoy had appeared , followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle . 
Malfoy was speaking . 
He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm … about how I couldn't use it for three months … " Crabbe and Goyle sniggered . 
" What are you doing , Weasley ? " Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron . 
" Suppose you'd love to live here , wouldn't you , Weasley ? 
I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true ? " Harry seized the back of Ron's robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy . 
" Leave him to me , " he hissed in Ron's ear . 
Harry crept silently around behind Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , bent down , and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path . 
" We were just discussing your friend Hagrid , " Malfoy said to Ron . " Just trying to imagine what he's saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . 
" What the — ? " Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing , he was laughing so hard . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot , staring wildly around , Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean . 
" What was that ? 
Who did that ? " 
" Very haunted up here , isn't it ? " said Ron , with the air of one commenting on the weather . 
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared . 
Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape . 
Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time . 
Goyle hopped furiously on the spot , trying to rub it out of his small , dull eyes . 
" It came from over there ! " said Malfoy , wiping his face , and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of Harry . 
Crabbe blundered forward , his long arms outstretched like a zombie . 
Harry dodged around him , picked up a stick , and lobbed it at Crabbe's back . 
As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see , it was Ron he started toward , but Harry stuck out his leg . 
Harry felt a great tug , then the cloak slid off his face . 
" AAARGH ! " he yelled , pointing at Harry's head . 
Then he turned tail and ran , at breakneck speed , back down the hill , Crabbe and Goyle behind him . 
Harry tugged the cloak up again , but the damage was done . 
" Harry ! " 
Ron said , stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared , " you'd better run for it ! 
If Malfoy tells anyone — you'd better get back to the castle , quick — " 
Would Malfoy believe what he had seen ? 
Would anyone believe Malfoy ? 
Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak — nobody except Dumbledore . 
Harry's stomach turned over — Dumbledore would know exactly what had happened , if Malfoy said anything — Back into Honeydukes , back down the cellar steps , across the stone floor , through the trapdoor — Harry pulled off the cloak , tucked it under his arm , and ran , flat out , along the passage … Malfoy would get back first … how long would it take him to find a teacher ? 
He would have to leave the cloak where it was , it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he hid it in a shadowy corner , then started to climb , fast as he could , his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute . 
He reached the inside of the witch's hump , tapped it with his wand , stuck his head through , and hoisted himself out ; the hump closed , and just as Harry jumped out from behind the statue , he heard quick footsteps approaching . 
It was Snape . 
He approached Harry at a swift walk , his black robes swishing , then stopped in front of him . 
" So , " he said . 
Harry tried to look innocent , all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands , which he quickly hid in his pockets . 
" Come with me , Potter , " said Snape . 
Harry followed him downstairs , trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape noticing . 
They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape's office . 
Harry had been in here only once before , and he had been in very serious trouble then too . 
" Sit , " said Snape . 
Harry sat . Snape , however , remained , standing . 
" Mr . 
Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story , Potter , " said Snape . 
Harry didn't say anything . 
" He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone . " 
" Mr . 
Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley , when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head . 
How do you think that could have happened ? " 
Harry tried to look mildly surprised . 
Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's . 
Harry tried hard not to blink . 
" Mr . 
Can you imagine what it might have been , Potter ? " " No , " said Harry , now trying to sound innocently curious . 
" It was your head , Potter . 
There was a long silence . 
" Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey , " said Harry . 
" Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade . 
" I know that , " said Harry , striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear . 
" If your head was in Hogsmeade , so was the rest of you . " " I ' ve been up in Gryffindor Tower , " said Harry . 
" Like you told — " " Can anyone confirm that ? " 
Harry didn't say anything . 
Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible smile . 
" So , " he said , straightening up again . 
" Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black . 
But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself . 
Let the ordinary people worry about his safety ! 
Harry stayed silent . 
Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth . 
He wasn't going to do it . 
" How extraordinarily like your father you are , Potter , " Snape said suddenly , his eyes glinting . 
A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too . 
His head was so swollen — " " SHUT UP ! " Harry was suddenly on his feet . 
He didn't care that Snape's face had gone rigid , the black eyes flashing dangerously . 
" What did you say to me , Potter ? " " I told you to shut up about my dad ! " Harry yelled . 
" I know the truth , all right ? 
Dumbledore told me ! 
" And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life ? " he whispered . 
" Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears ? " 
Harry bit his lip . 
He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to admit it — but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth . 
" I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father , Potter , " he said , a terrible grin twisting his face . 
There was nothing brave about what he did . 
He was saving his own skin as much as mine . 
Harry didn't move . 
There was a pounding in his ears . 
Pull them out , Potter ! " Cold with dread , Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and the Marauder's Map . 
" Ron gave them to me , " said Harry , praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him . 
How very touching … and what is this ? " 
Snape had picked up the map . 
Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive . 
Snape turned it over , his eyes on Harry . 
" Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment ? " he said . 
" Why don't I just — throw this away ? " 
" No ! " Harry said quickly . 
" So ! " said Snape , his long nostrils quivering . 
" Is this another treasured gift from Mr . Weasley ? 
Or is it — something else ? 
A letter , perhaps , written in invisible ink ? 
Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the Dementors ? " 
Harry blinked . 
Snape's eyes gleamed . 
" Let me see , let me see … " he muttered , taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk . 
" Reveal your secret ! " he said , touching the wand to the parchment . 
Nothing happened . 
Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking . 
Snape said , tapping the map sharply . 
It stayed blank . 
Harry was taking deep , calming breaths . 
" Professor Severus Snape , master of this school , commands you to yield the information you conceal ! " Snape said , hitting the map with his wand . 
As though an invisible hand were writing upon it , words appeared on the smooth surface of the map . 
Snape froze . 
Harry stared , dumbstruck , at the message . 
But the map didn't stop there . 
" Mr . 
Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor . " 
Harry closed his eyes in horror . 
" Mr . 
Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day , and advises him to wash his hair , the slimeball . " 
Harry waited for the blow to fall . 
" So … " said Snape softly . 
" We ' ll see about this … " 
He strode across to his fire , seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace , and threw it into the flames . 
Snape called into the fire . 
" I want a word ! " Utterly bewildered , Harry stared at the fire . 
" I certainly did , " said Snape , his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk . 
He was carrying this . " 
Snape pointed at the parchment , on which the words of Messrs . Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs were still shining . 
" Well ? " said Snape . 
Lupin continued to stare at the map . 
Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking . 
" Well ? " said Snape again . 
Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing ? " 
Lupin looked up and , by the merest half - glance in Harry's direction , warned him not to interrupt . 
" Do you really think so , Severus ? 
It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it . 
Childish , but surely not dangerous ? 
I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop — " " Indeed ? " said Snape . 
His jaw had gone rigid with anger . 
You don't think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers ? " 
Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about . 
" Harry , do you know any of these men ? " " No , " said Harry quickly . 
" You see , Severus ? " said Lupin , turning back to Snape . 
He was completely out of breath , and stopped just short of Snape's desk , clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak . 
" I — gave — Harry — that — stuff , " he choked . 
" Harry , Ron , come with me , I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us , Severus — " Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office . 
He . 
Ron , and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking . 
Then Harry turned to Lupin . 
" Professor , I — " " I don't want to hear explanations , " said Lupin shortly . 
He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice . 
" I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr . Filch many years ago . 
Yes , I know it's a map , " he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed . 
" I don't want to know how it fell into your possession . 
Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around . 
And I can't let you have it back , Harry . " 
Harry had expected that , and was too keen for explanations to protest . 
" Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers ? " " Because … " Lupin hesitated , " because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school . 
They'd think it extremely entertaining . " 
" Do you know them ? " said Harry , impressed . 
" We ' ve met , " he said shortly . 
He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before . 
" Don't expect me to cover up for you again , Harry . 
I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously . 
But I would have thought that what you have heard when the Dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you . 
A poor way to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks . " 
He walked away , leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape's office . 
Slowly , he and Ron mounted the marble staircase . 
As Harry passed the one - eyed witch , he remembered the Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there , but he didn't dare go and get it . 
" It's my fault , " said Ron abruptly . 
" I persuaded you to go . 
Lupin's right , it was stupid , we shouldn't ' ve done it — " He broke off ; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing , and Hermione was walking toward them . 
One look at her face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened . 
" Or have you just been to tell on us ? " 
" No , " said Hermione . 
She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling . 
" I just thought you ought to know … Hagrid lost his case . 
Buckbeak is going to be executed . " 
" He sent me this , " Hermione said , holding out the letter . 
Harry took it . 
The parchment was damp , and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read . 
Dear Hermione , We lost . 
I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts . 
Execution date to be fixed . 
Beaky has enjoyed London . 
I won't forget all the help you gave us . 
Hagrid " They can't do this , " said Harry . 
" They can't . 
Buckbeak isn't dangerous . " 
" Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it , " said Hermione , wiping her eyes . 
" You know what he's like . 
" Yeah , it will , " said Ron fiercely . 
" You won't have to do all the work alone this time , Hermione . 
I ' ll help . " 
" Oh , Ron ! " Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely . 
Ron , looking quite terrified , patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head . 
Finally , Hermione drew away . 
" Ron , I'm really , really sorry about Scabbers … " she sobbed . 
" And he was a bit useless . 
The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second break - in made it impossible for Harry , Ron , and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings . 
" S ' all my fault . 
An'then Lucius Malfoy stood up an'said his bit , and the Committee jus'did exac ' ly what he told ' em … " " There's still the appeal ! " said Ron fiercely . 
" Don't give up yet , we ' re working on it ! " 
They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class . 
Ahead they could see Malfoy , who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle , and kept looking back , laughing derisively . 
" S ' no good , Ron , " said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps . 
" That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket . 
I owe him that … " Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin , his face buried in his handkerchief . 
" Look at him blubber ! " Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors , listening . 
" And he's supposed to be our teacher ! " 
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster . 
Malfoy staggered . 
Harry , Ron , Crabbe , and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again . 
" Get off , Ron ! " Hermione pulled out her wand . 
Malfoy stepped backward . 
Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions , thoroughly bewildered . 
Malfoy muttered , and in a moment , all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons . 
" Hermione ! " 
Ron said again , sounding both stunned and impressed . 
" Harry , you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final ! " Hermione said shrilly . 
" We'd better go . " 
They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom . 
" You ' re late , boys ! " said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door . 
" Come along , quickly , wands out , we ' re experimenting with Cheering Charms today , we ' ve already divided into pairs — " Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags . 
Ron looked behind him . 
" Where's Hermione gone ? " 
Harry looked around too . 
Hermione hadn't entered the classroom , yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door . 
" That's weird , " said Harry , staring at Ron . " Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something ? " 
By the time they had finished their apple pie , the after - effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off , and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried . 
They passed the security trolls , gave the Fat Lady the password ( " Flibbertigibbet " ) , and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room . 
Hermione was sitting at a table , fast asleep , her head resting on an open Arithmancy book . 
Harry prodded her awake . 
" Wh — what ? " said Hermione , waking with a start and staring wildly around . 
" Is it time to go ? W — which lesson have we got now ? " " Divination , but it's not for another twenty minutes , " said Harry . 
" Hermione , why didn't you come to Charms ? " " What ? 
Oh no ! " Hermione squeaked . 
" I forgot to go to Charms ! " " But how could you forget ? " said Harry . 
" You were with us till we were right outside the classroom ! " 
" I don't believe it ! " 
Hermione wailed . 
" Was Professor Flitwick angry ? 
" I reckon you ' re cracking up . 
You ' re trying to do too much . " 
" No , I'm not ! " said Hermione , brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag . 
" I just made a mistake , that's all ! 
I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry … I ' ll see you in Divination ! " Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney's classroom twenty minutes later , looking extremely harassed . 
" I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms ! 
Together they climbed the ladder into the dim , stifling tower room . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table . 
" I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term , " Ron muttered , casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney , in case she was lurking nearby . 
" Good day to you ! " said the familiar , misty voice , and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows . 
Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement , their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball . 
" I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned , " said Professor Trelawney , sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around . 
" The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb , and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice . " 
Hermione snorted . 
Who sets the exam ? 
She does ! 
Harry and Ron choked back laughs . 
It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow . 
She continued , however , as though she had not . 
" I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths . 
We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes — " Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise — " so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious . 
Perhaps , if we are lucky , some of you will see before the end of the class . " 
And so they began . 
Harry , at least , felt extremely foolish , staring blankly at the crystal ball , trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as " this is stupid " kept drifting across it . 
It didn't help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting . 
" This is such a waste of time , " Hermione hissed . 
" I don't need help , " Ron whispered . 
" It's obvious what this means . 
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing . 
" Now , really ! " said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in their direction . 
Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized . 
" You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations ! " 
She approached their table and peered into their crystal ball . 
Harry felt his heart sinking . 
He was sure he knew what was coming — " There is something here ! " 
Professor Trelawney whispered , lowering her face to the ball , so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses . 
" Something moving … but what is it ? " 
And sure enough — " My dear , " Professor Trelawney breathed , gazing up at Harry . 
" Not that ridiculous Grim again ! " Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face . 
Parvati whispered something to Lavender , and they both glared at Hermione too . 
Professor Trelawney stood up , surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger . 
" I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear , it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires . 
There was a moment's silence . 
Then — " Fine ! " said Hermione suddenly , getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag . 
" Fine ! " she repeated , swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair . 
" I give up ! 
I'm leaving ! " 
And to the whole class's amazement , Hermione strode over to the trapdoor , kicked it open , and climbed down the ladder out of sight . 
It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again . 
Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim . 
She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron's table , breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her . 
" Ooooo , Professor Trelawney , I ' ve just remembered ! 
' Around Easter , one of our number will leave us forever ! ' 
You said it ages ago , Professor ! " 
Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile . 
" Yes , my dear , I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us . 
One hopes , however , that one might have mistaken the Signs … The Inner Eye can be a burden , you know … " Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed , and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead . 
" Yeah … " Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist . 
Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again ? 
Would he ? 
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing . 
Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse , and he wasn't the only one . 
" Call this a holiday ! " 
Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon . 
But nobody had as much to do as Hermione . 
She was usually last to leave the common room at night , first to arrive at the library the next morning ; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes , and seemed constantly close to tears . 
Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal . 
He was so absorbed , he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks . 
Harry , meanwhile , had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day , not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood . 
The Gryffindor - Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays . 
This meant ( as Wood constantly reminded his team ) that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup . 
It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry , because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points . 
" Only if we ' re more than fifty points up , Harry , or we win the match but lose the Cup . 
You must catch the Snitch only if we ' re — " " I KNOW , OLIVER ! " 
Harry yelled . 
The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match . 
Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley ( Ron's second oldest brother ) had been Seeker . 
The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever . 
Malfoy was still smarting about the mud - throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment . 
Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw , but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school . 
By the time the holidays were over , tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point . 
A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors , culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears . 
Harry was having a particularly bad time of it . 
Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went , in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action . 
The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically , so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast , chattering crowd . 
When he wasn't flying it , he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there . 
All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match . 
Even Hermione had put down her books . 
" I can't work , I can't concentrate , " she said nervously . 
There was a great deal of noise . 
Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever . 
Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner , prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself Angelina , 
Alicia , and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes . 
Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione , removed from the center of things , trying not to think about the next day , because every time he did , he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach . 
" You ' re going to be fine , " Hermione told him , though she looked positively terrified . 
" You ' ve got a Firebolt ! " said Ron . " Yeah … " said Harry , his stomach writhing . 
It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled , " Team ! 
Bed ! " Harry slept badly . 
First he dreamed that he had overslept , and that Wood was yelling , " Where were you ? 
We had to use Neville instead ! " Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons . 
He was flying at breakneck speed , trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth , when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt . 
He fell through the air and woke with a start . 
It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken place yet , that he was safe in bed , and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons . 
Quietly as he could , he got out of his four - poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window . 
The grounds were still and quiet . 
No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest ; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent - looking . 
It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect . 
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye . 
An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn . 
Harry dashed to his bedside table , snatched up his glasses , and put them on , then hurried back to the window . 
It couldn't be the Grim — not now — not right before the match — He peered out at the grounds again and , after a minute's frantic searching , spotted it . 
It was skirting the edge of the forest now … It wasn't the Grim at all … it was a cat … Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail . 
It was only Crookshanks … Or was it only Crookshanks ? 
Harry squinted , pressing his nose flat against the glass . 
Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt . 
Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too . 
Harry stared . 
What did this mean ? 
If Crookshanks could see the dog as well , how could it be an omen of Harry's death ? 
" Ron ! " 
Harry hissed . 
" Ron ! 
Wake up ! " " Huh ? " " I need you to tell me if you can see something ! " " S ' all dark , Harry , " Ron muttered thickly . 
" What ' re you on about ? " " Down here — " Harry looked quickly back out of the window . 
Crookshanks and the dog had vanished . 
Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle , but they weren't there . 
Where had they gone ? 
Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause . 
Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual . 
Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat , while touching nothing himself . 
Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished , so they could get an idea of the conditions . 
As they left the Great Hall , everyone applauded again . 
" Good luck , Harry ! " called Cho . 
Harry felt himself blushing . 
Finally , they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn . 
" Locker rooms , " said Wood tersely . 
Three quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes , waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them , or brandishing banners with slogans like " GO GRYFFINDOR ! " and " LIONS FOR THE CUP . " Behind the Slytherin goal posts , however , two hundred people were wearing green ; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags , and Professor Snape sat in the very front row , wearing green like everyone else , and a very grim smile . 
" Potter , Bell , Johnson , Spinnet , Weasley , Weasley , and Wood . 
Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years — " Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of ' boos ' from the Slytherin end . 
" And here come the Slytherin team , led by Captain Flint . 
He's made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill — " More boos from the Slytherin crowd . 
Harry , however , thought Lee had a point . 
Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team ; the rest of them were enormous . 
" Captains , shake hands ! " said Madam Hooch . 
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very tightly ; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's fingers . 
" Mount your brooms ! " said Madam Hooch . 
" Three … two … one … " The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air . 
Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead ; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight ; he glanced around , saw Malfoy on his tail , and sped off in search of the Snitch . 
" And it's Gryffindor in possession , Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with the Quaffle , heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts , looking good , Alicia ! 
Argh , no — Quaffle intercepted by Warrington , Warrington of Slytherin tearing UP the field — WHAM ! — nice Bludger work there by George Weasley , Warrington drops the Quaffle , it's caught by — Johnson , Gryffindor back in possession , come on , Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck , Angelina , that's a Bludger ! – SHE SCORES ! 
TEN - ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR ! " Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field ; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight " OUCH ! " Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her . 
" Sorry ! " said Flint as the crowd below booed . 
" Sorry , didn't see her ! " A moment later , Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of Flint's head . 
" That will do ! " 
" Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser ! 
Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser ! " 
" Come off it , Miss ! " howled Fred , but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty . 
" Come on , Alicia ! " yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd . 
TWENTY - ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR ! " Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint , still bleeding freely , fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty . 
Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts , his jaw clenched . 
It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up — " Gryffindor in possession , no , Slytherin in possession — no ! Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell , Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle , she's streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE ! " Montague , a Slytherin Chaser , had swerved in front of Katie , and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head . 
Katie cart - wheeled in the air , managed to stay on her broom , but dropped the Quaffle . 
Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him . 
A minute later , Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker . 
Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement . 
He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn't catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration , Harry pulled his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked . 
One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear , hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater , Derrick . 
Then again … WHOOSH . 
The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow . 
The other Beater , Bole , was closing in . 
Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him , clubs raised — He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second , and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch . 
" Ha haaa ! " yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other , clutching their heads . 
" Too bad , boys ! 
You ' ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt ! 
— it was a joke , Professor , it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession , Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts , come on now , Wood , save — ! " But Flint had scored ; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end , and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him . 
" Sorry , Professor , sorry ! 
So , Gryffindor in the lead , thirty points to ten , and Gryffindor in possession — " It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in . 
Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead , the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle . 
Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger . 
George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation . 
The Snitch had disappeared again . 
Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match , looking around for it once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — Katie scored . 
Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her , clubs raised , in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge . 
Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood ; they caught him in the stomach , one after the other , and he rolled over in the air , clutching his broom , completely winded . 
" Gryffindor penalty ! " 
And Angelina scored . 
Moments later , Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington , knocking the Quaffle out of his hands ; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy - ten . 
The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead , and if Harry caught the Snitch now , the Cup was theirs . 
Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field , high above the rest of the game , with Malfoy speeding along behind him . 
And then he saw it . 
Harry put on a huge burst of speed ; the wind was roaring in his ears ; he stretched out his hand , but suddenly , the Firebolt was slowing down — Horrified , he looked around . 
Malfoy had thrown himself forward , grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail , and was pulling it back . 
He had achieved what he'd wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again . 
" Penalty ! 
Penalty to Gryffindor ! I ' ve never seen such tactics . " 
Madam Hooch screeched , shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One . 
" YOU CHEATING SCUM ! " Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone , dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach . 
Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty , but she was so angry she missed by several feet . 
" Seventy - twenty to Gryffindor … " Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other . 
" Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor , come on , Angelina , COME ON ! " 
Harry looked around . 
Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina , including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around , bent so low he was lying flat along the handle , and kicked it forward . 
Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty ! " Harry , who had almost pelted headlong into the stands , skidded to a halt in midair , reversed , and zoomed back into the middle of the field . 
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still . 
Malfoy was diving , a look of triumph on his face — there , a few feet above the grass below , was a tiny , golden glimmer — Harry urged the Firebolt downward , but Malfoy was miles ahead — " Go ! Go ! Go ! " Harry urged his broom . 
He was gaining on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at Malfoy's ankles — he was level — Harry threw himself forward , took both hands off his broom . 
He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and — " YES ! " 
He pulled out of his dive , his hand in the air , and the stadium exploded . 
Harry soared above the crowd , an odd ringing in his ears . 
The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist , beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers . 
Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field . 
Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him . 
Then he , and the rest of the team , were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd . 
There was Percy , jumping up and down like a maniac , all dignity forgotten . 
They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands , where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup . 
If only there had been a Dementor around … As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup , as he lifted it into the air , Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus . 
Harry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week . 
Even the weather seemed to be celebrating ; as June approached , the days became cloudless and sultry , and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice , perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake . 
But they couldn't . 
Exams were nearly upon them , and instead of lazing around outside , the students were forced to remain inside the castle , trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows . 
He was becoming increasingly edgy , and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings . 
In fact , the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione . 
Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once , but they couldn't restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself . 
The first column read : Monday 9 o ' clock , Arithmancy 9 o ' clock , Transfiguration Lunch 1 o ' clock , Charms 1 o ' clock , Ancient Runes " Hermione ? " 
" Er — are you sure you ' ve copied down these times right ? " 
" Yes , of course I have . " 
" No , " said Hermione shortly . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid . 
But still … we ' ll know day after tomorrow — one way or the other — " They had Potions that afternoon , which was an unqualified disaster . 
Then came Astronomy at midnight , up on the tallest tower ; History of Magic on Wednesday morning , in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch - hunts , while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue's choconut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom . 
Their second to last exam , on Thursday morning , was Defense Against the Dark Arts . 
Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken ; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun , where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a Grindylow , cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps , squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a Hinkypunk , then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new Boggart . 
" Excellent , Harry , " Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk , grinning . 
Flushed with his success , Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione . 
Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it . 
" Hermione ! " said Lupin , startled . 
" What's the matter ? " 
" P - P - Professor McGonagall ! " Hermione gasped , pointing into the trunk . 
" Sh - she said I'd failed everything ! " 
It took a little while to calm Hermione down . 
When at last she had regained a grip on herself , she , Harry , and Ron went back to the castle . 
Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's Boggart , but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps . 
Cornelius Fudge , sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak , was standing there staring out at the grounds . 
He started at the sight of Harry . 
" Hello there , Harry ! " he said . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
Hermione and Ron , not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic , hovered awkwardly in the background . 
" Lovely day , " said Fudge , casting an eye over the lake . 
" Pity … pity … " He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry . 
" I'm here on an unpleasant mission , Harry . 
The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad Hippogriff . 
As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation , I was asked to step in . " 
Ron interrupted , stepping forward . 
" No , no , it's scheduled for this afternoon , " said Fudge , looking curiously at Ron . " Then you might not have to witness an execution at all ! " said Ron stoutly . 
Before Fudge could answer , two wizards came through the castle doors behind him . 
One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes ; the other was tall and strapping , with a thin back mustache . 
Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures , because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice , " Dear , dear , I'm getting too old for this … Two o ' clock , isn't it , Fudge ? " 
The black - mustached man was fingering something in his belt ; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe . 
Ron opened his mouth to say something , but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall . 
" Why'd you stop me ? " said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch . 
" Did you see them ? 
They ' ve even got the axe ready ! 
All around them , people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch , happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon , but Harry , Ron , and Hermione , lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak , didn't join in . 
Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination ; Hermione's , Muggle Studies . 
They walked up the marble staircase together ; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh , where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney's classroom , trying to cram in a bit of last - minute studying . 
He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing . 
" Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball ? " he asked them unhappily . 
" Nope , " said Ron in an offhand voice . 
He kept checking his watch ; Harry knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started . 
The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly . 
As each person climbed back down the silver ladder , the rest of the class hissed , " What did she ask ? 
Was it okay ? " 
But they all refused to say . 
" She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you , I ' ll have a horrible accident ! " 
squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron , who had now reached the landing . 
" That's convenient , " snorted Ron . 
" You know , I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her " — he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead — " she's a right old fraud . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry , looking at his own watch . 
It was now two o ' clock . 
" She says I ' ve got all the makings of a true Seer , " she informed Harry and Ron . 
" I saw loads of stuff … Well , good luck ! " 
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender . 
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight . 
Harry was now the only person left to be tested . 
He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall , listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window , his mind across the grounds with Hagrid . 
Finally , after about twenty minutes , Ron's large feet reappeared on the ladder . 
" How'd it go ? " 
Harry asked him , standing up . 
The tower room was hotter than ever before ; the curtains were closed , the fire was alight , and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball . 
" Good day , my dear , " she said softly . 
" If you would kindly gaze into the Orb … Take your time , now … then tell me what you see within it … " Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared , stared as hard as he could , willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog , but nothing happened . 
" Well ? " 
Professor Trelawney prompted delicately . 
" What do you see ? " 
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them . 
He thought of what Ron had just said , and decided to pretend . 
" Er — " said Harry , " a dark shape … um … " " What does it resemble ? " 
whispered Professor Trelawney . 
" Think , now … " Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak . 
" A Hippogriff , " he said firmly . 
" Indeed ! " whispered Professor Trelawney , scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees . 
" My boy , you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic ! 
" Are you sure ? " Professor Trelawney urged him . 
" Are you quite sure , dear ? 
You don't see it writhing on the ground , perhaps , and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it ? " 
" No ! " said Harry , starting to feel slightly sick . 
" No blood ? 
No weeping Hagrid ? " " No ! " said Harry again , wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat . 
" It looks fine , it's — flying away … " Professor Trelawney sighed . 
" Well , dear , I think we ' ll leave it there … A little disappointing … but I'm sure you did your best . " 
Relieved , Harry got up , picked up his bag and turned to go , but then a loud , harsh voice spoke behind him . 
Harry wheeled around . 
Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair ; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging . 
" S — sorry ? " said Harry . 
But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him . 
Her eyes started to roll . 
Harry sat there in a panic . 
TONIGHT … BEFORE MIDNIGHT … THE SERVANT … WILL SET OUT … TO REJOIN … HIS MASTER … " Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest . 
She made a grunting sort of noise . 
Harry sat there , staring at her . 
Then , quite suddenly , Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again . 
" I'm so sorry , dear boy , " she said dreamily , " the heat of the day , you know … I drifted off for a moment … " Harry sat there , staring at her . " Is there anything wrong , my dear ? " " You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord's going to rise again … that his servant's going to go back to him . " 
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled . 
" The Dark Lord ? 
You said the Dark Lord — " " I think you must have dozed off too , dear ! " said Professor Trelawney . 
" I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far - fetched as that ! " 
Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase , wondering … had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real prediction ? 
Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test ? 
Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower , Professor Trelawney's words still resounding in his head . 
People were striding past him in the opposite direction , laughing and joking , heading for the grounds and a bit of long - awaited freedom ; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room , it was almost deserted . 
Over in the corner , however , sat Ron and Hermione . 
" Professor Trelawney , " Harry panted , " just told me — " But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces . 
" Buckbeak lost , " said Ron weakly . 
" Hagrid's just sent this . " 
Hagrid's note was dry this time , no tears had splattered it , yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible . 
They're going to execute at sunset . 
Nothing you can do . 
Don't come down . 
I don't want you to see it . 
Hagrid " We ' ve got to go , " said Harry at once . 
" He can't just sit there on his own , waiting for the executioner ! " 
" Sunset , though , " said Ron , who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way . 
" We'd never be allowed …'specially you , Harry … " Harry sank his head into his hands , thinking . 
" If we only had the Invisibility Cloak … " " Where is it ? " said Hermione . 
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one - eyed witch . 
" That's true , " said Hermione , getting to her feet . 
" If he sees you … How do you open the witch's hump again ? " " You — you tap it and say , ' Dissendium , ' " said Harry . 
" But — " Hermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence ; she strode across the room , pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight . 
Ron said , staring after her . 
She had . 
" First you hit Malfoy , then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — " 
Hermione looked rather flattered . 
They went down to dinner with everybody else , but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward . 
Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes ; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump . 
They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming . 
Hermione poked her head around the door . 
" Okay , " she whispered , " no one there — cloak on — " Walking very close together so that nobody would see them , they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak , then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds . 
The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest , gilding the top branches of the trees . 
They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked . 
He was a minute in answering , and when he did , he looked all around for his visitor , pale - faced and trembling . 
" It's us , " Harry hissed . 
" We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak . 
" Yeh shouldn ' ve come ! " Hagrid whispered , but he stood back , and they stepped inside . 
Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak . 
Hagrid was not crying , nor did he throw himself upon their necks . 
He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do . 
This helplessness was worse to watch than tears . 
" Wan'some tea ? " he said . 
" Where's Buckbeak , Hagrid ? " said Hermione hesitantly . 
" I — I took him outside , " said Hagrid , spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug . 
" He's tethered in me pumpkin patch . 
Thought he oughta see the trees an ' — an'smell fresh air — before — " Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor . 
" There's another one in the cupboard , " Hagrid said , sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve . 
Harry glanced at Ron , who looked back hopelessly . 
" Isn't there anything anyone can do , Hagrid ? " 
Harry asked fiercely , sitting down next to him . 
" Dumbledore — " " He's tried , " said Hagrid . 
His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort . 
" Dumbledore's gonna come down while it — while it happens . 
Wrote me this mornin ' . 
She straightened up with the new jug in her hands , fighting back tears . 
" We ' ll stay with you too , Hagrid , " she began , but Hagrid shook his shaggy head . 
I told yeh , I don ' wan ' yeh watchin ' . 
An ' yeh shouldn ' be down here anyway … If Fudge an ' Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission , Harry , yeh ' ll be in big trouble . " 
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face , but she hid them from Hagrid , bustling around making tea . 
Then , as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug , she let out a shriek . 
" Ron , I don't believe it — it's Scabbers ! " 
Ron gaped at her . " What are you talking about ? " 
Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down . 
With a frantic squeak , and much scrambling to get back inside , Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table . 
" Scabbers ! " said Ron blankly . 
" Scabbers , what are you doing here ? " 
He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light . 
He was thinner than ever , large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches , and he writhed in Ron's hands as though desperate to free himself . 
" It's okay , Scabbers ! " said Ron . " No cats ! 
There's nothing here to hurt you ! " Hagrid suddenly stood up , his eyes fixed on the window . 
" They're comin ' … " Harry , Ron , and Hermione whipped around . 
A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps . 
Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge . 
Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner , Macnair . 
" Yeh gotta go , " said Hagrid . 
" They mustn ' find yeh here … Go now … " Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak . 
They followed him to the door into his back garden . 
Harry felt strangely unreal , and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away , tethered to a tree behind Hagrid's pumpkin patch . 
Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening . 
He turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously . 
" It's okay , Beaky , " said Hagrid softly . 
" It's okay … " He turned to Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
" Go on , " he said . 
" Get goin ' . " 
" Hagrid , we can't — " " We ' ll tell them what really happened — " " They can't kill him — " " Go ! " said Hagrid fiercely . 
They had no choice . 
As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron , they heard voices at the front of the cabin . 
Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight . 
" Go quick , " he said hoarsely . 
" Don ' listen … " And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door . 
Slowly , in a kind of horrified trance , Harry , Ron , and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid's house . 
As they reached the other side , the front door closed with a sharp snap . 
" Please , let's hurry , " Hermione whispered . 
" I can't stand it , I can't bear it … " They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle . 
The sun was sinking fast now ; the sky had turned to a clear , purple - tinged gray , but to the west there was a ruby - red glow . 
Ron stopped dead . 
" Oh , please , Ron , " Hermione began . 
" It's Scabbers — he won't — stay put — " Ron was bent over , trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket , but the rat was going berserk ; squeaking madly , twisting and flailing , trying to sink his teeth into Ron's hand . 
" Scabbers , it's me , you idiot , it's Ron , " Ron hissed . 
" Oh , Ron , please let's move , they ' re going to do it ! " 
Hermione breathed . 
" Okay — Scabbers , stay put — " They walked forward ; Harry , like Hermione , was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them . 
Ron stopped again . 
There was a jumble of indistinct male voices , a silence , and then , without warning , the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe . 
Hermione swayed on the spot . 
" They did it ! " 
she whispered to Harry . 
" I'd — don't believe it — they did it ! " 
The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak . 
The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the longshadowed grounds . 
Then , behind them , they heard a wild howling . 
" Hagrid , " Harry muttered . 
Without thinking about what he was doing , he made to turn back , but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms . 
" We can't , " said Ron , who was paper - white . 
They set off back toward the castle , walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak . 
By the time they reached open ground , darkness was settling like a spell around them . 
" Scabbers , keep still , " Ron hissed , clamping his hand over his chest . 
Ron came to a sudden halt , trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket . 
" What's the matter with you , You stupid rat ? 
Stay still — OUCH ! 
Hermione whispered urgently . 
He was writhing with all his might , trying to break free of Ron's grip . 
" What's the matter with him ? " 
But Harry had just seen — stinking toward them , his body low to the ground , wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks . 
Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers's squeaks , Harry couldn't tell . 
" Crookshanks ! " 
Hermione moaned . 
" No , go away , Crookshanks ! 
Go away ! " 
But the cat was getting nearer — " Scabbers — NO ! " Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron's clutching fingers , hit the ground , and scampered away . 
In one bound , Crookshanks sprang after him , and before Harry or Hermione could stop him , Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness . 
" Ron ! " Hermione moaned . 
She and Harry looked at each other , then followed at a sprint ; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak ; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron ; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks . 
" Get away from him — get away — Scabbers , come here — " There was a loud thud . 
Get off , you stinking cat — " Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron ; they skidded to a stop right in front of him . 
He was sprawled on the ground , but Scabbers was back in his pocket ; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump . 
Harry reached for his wand , but too late — the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest ; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair ; he felt its hot breath , saw inch - long teeth — But the force of its leap had carried it too far ; it rolled off him . 
Dazed , feeling as though his ribs were broken , Harry tried to stand up ; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack . 
Ron was on his feet . 
As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside ; the dog's jaws fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm . 
Harry lunged forward , he seized a handful of the brute's hair , but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll — Then , out of nowhere , something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again . 
He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too . 
Harry groped for his wand , blinking blood out of his eyes " Lumos ! " he whispered . 
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree ; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind , whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer . 
And there , at the base of the trunk , was the dog , dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots — Ron was fighting furiously , but his head and torso were slipping out of sight — 
" Ron ! " Harry shouted , trying to follow , but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again . 
All they could see now was one of Ron's legs , which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground — but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot ; Ron's leg had broken , and a moment later , his foot vanished from sight . 
" Harry — we ' ve got to go for help — " Hermione gasped ; she was bleeding too ; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder . 
" No ! 
" If that dog can get in , we can , " Harry panted , darting here and there , trying to find a way through the vicious , swishing branches , but he couldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree's blows . 
He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk . 
Abruptly , as though the tree had been turned to marble , it stopped moving . 
Not a leaf twitched or shook . 
" Crookshanks ! " 
Hermione whispered uncertainly . 
" How did he know — ? " " He's friends with that dog , " said Harry grimly . 
Come on — and keep your wand out — " They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds , but before they had reached the gap in the roots , Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail . 
Harry went next ; he crawled forward , headfirst , and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel . 
Crookshanks was a little way along , his eyes flashing in the light from Harry's wand . 
Seconds later , Hermione slithered down beside him . 
" Where's Ron ? " she whispered in a terrified voice . 
" Where does this tunnel come out ? " Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him . 
" I don't know … It's marked on the Marauder's Map but Fred and George said no one's ever gotten into it … It goes off the edge of the map , but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade … " 
They moved as fast as they could , bent almost double ; ahead of them , Crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view . 
On and on went the passage ; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes … All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him … He was drawing breath in sharp , painful gasps , running at a crouch … And then the tunnel began to rise ; moments later it twisted , and Crookshanks had gone . 
Ahead Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening . 
He and Hermione paused , gasping for breath , edging forward . 
Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond . 
It was a room , a very disordered , dusty room . 
Paper was peeling from the walls ; there were stains all over the floor ; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it . 
Harry glanced at Hermione , who looked very frightened but nodded . 
Harry pulled himself out of the hole , staring around . 
The room was deserted , but a door to their right stood open , leading to a shadowy hallway . 
Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again . 
" Harry , " she whispered , " I think we ' re in the Shrieking Shack . " 
Harry looked around . 
His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them . 
At that moment , there was a creak overhead . 
Both of them looked up at the ceiling . 
Hermione's grip on Harry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers . 
He raised his eyebrows at her ; she nodded again and let go . 
Quietly as they could , they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase . 
Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor , where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs . 
They reached the dark landing . 
" Nox , " they whispered together , and the lights at the end of their wands went out . 
Only one door was open . 
Wand held tightly before him , Harry kicked the door wide open . 
On the floor beside him , clutching his leg , which stuck out at a strange angle , was Ron . 
Harry and Hermione dashed across to him . 
" Ron — are you okay ? " " Where's the dog ? " " Not a dog , " Ron moaned . 
His teeth were gritted with pain . 
" Harry , it's a trap — " " What — " " He's the dog … he's an Animagus . " 
Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder . 
Harry wheeled around . 
With a snap , the man in the shadows closed the door behind them . 
The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face , it looked like a skull . 
It was Sirius Black . 
Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands , high in the air , and Black caught them . 
Then he took a step closer . 
His eyes were fixed on Harry . 
" I thought you'd come and help your friend , " he said hoarsely . 
His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it . 
Brave of you not to run for a teacher . 
A boiling hate erupted in Harry's chest , leaving no place for fear . 
For the first time in his life , he wanted his wand back in his hand , not to defend himself , but to attack … to kill . 
Without knowing what he was doing , he started forward , but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back … " No , Harry ! " Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ; Ron , however , spoke to Black . 
" If you want to kill Harry , you ' ll have to kill us too ! " he said fiercely , though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color , and he swayed slightly as he spoke . 
Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes . 
" Did you hear me ? " Ron said weakly , though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright . 
" You ' ll have to kill all three of us ! " " There ' ll be only one murder here tonight , " said Black , and his grin widened . 
" Why's that ? " 
Harry spat , trying to wrench himself free of Ron , and Hermione . 
" Be quiet ! " " HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD ! " Harry roared , and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward — He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen , whereas Black was a tall , full - grown man — all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return — Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid , but Black didn't raise the wands in time — one of Harry's hands fastened over his wasted wrist , forcing the wand tips away ; the knuckles of Harry's other hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell , backward , into the wall — Hermione was screaming ; Ron was yelling ; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry's face by inches ; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly , but he clung on , his other hand punching every part of Black it could find . 
But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat " No , " he hissed , " I ' ve waited too long — " The fingers tightened , Harry choked , his glasses askew . 
Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere . 
Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain ; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter — He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor ; he threw himself toward it but " Argh ! " Crookshanks had joined the fray ; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry's arm ; Harry threw him off , but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry's wand — " NO YOU DON ' T ! " roared Harry , and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside , spitting ; Harry snatched up his wand and turned — 
" Get out of the way ! " he shouted at Ron and Hermione . 
Hermione , gasping for breath , her lip bleeding , scrambled aside , snatching up her and Ron's wands . 
Ron crawled to the four - poster and collapsed onto it , panting , his white face now tinged with green , both hands clutching his broken leg . 
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall . 
His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer , his wand pointing straight at Black's heart . 
" Going to kill me , Harry ? " he whispered . 
Harry stopped right above him , his wand still pointing at Black's chest , looking down at him . 
A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eye and his nose was bleeding . 
" You killed my parents , " said Harry , his voice shaking slightly , but his wand hand quite steady . 
" But if you knew the whole story . " 
" The whole story ? " 
Harry repeated , a furious pounding in his ears . 
" You sold them to Voldemort . 
That's all I need to know . " " You ' ve got to listen to me , " Black said , and there was a note of urgency in his voice now . 
" You ' ll regret it if you don't … You don't understand … " " I understand a lot better than you think , " said Harry , and his voice shook more than ever . 
" You never heard her , did you ? 
Black blinked and looked down at the cat . 
He turned his ugly , squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes . 
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks , his grip tightening on the wand . 
So what if he had to kill the cat too ? 
It was in league with Black … If it was prepared to die , trying to protect Black , that wasn't Harry's business … If Black wanted to save it , that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents … Harry raised the wand . 
Now was the moment to do it . 
Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father . 
He was going to kill Black . 
He had to kill Black . 
The seconds lengthened . 
And still Harry stood frozen there , wand poised , Black staring up at him , Crookshanks on his chest . 
" WE ' RE UP HERE ! " Hermione screamed suddenly . 
" WE ' RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK ! " Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks ; Harry gripped his wand convulsively — Do it now ! said a voice in his head — but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't done it . 
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room , his face bloodless , his wand raised and ready . 
His eyes flickered over Ron , lying on the floor , over Hermione , cowering next to the door , to Harry , standing there with his wand covering Black , and then to Black himself , crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet . 
" Expelliarmus ! " Lupin shouted . 
Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand ; so did the two Hermione was holding . 
Lupin caught them all deftly , then moved into the room , staring at Black , who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across his chest . 
Harry stood there , feeling suddenly empty . 
Black was going to be handed back to the Dementors . 
Then Lupin spoke , in a very tense voice . 
" Where is he , Sirius ? " 
Harry looked quickly at Lupin . 
He didn't understand what Lupin meant . 
Who was Lupin talking about ? 
He turned to look at Black again . 
Black's face was quite expressionless . 
Then , very slowly , he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron . Mystified , Harry glanced around at Ron , who looked bewildered . 
Unless " — Lupin's eyes suddenly widened , as though he was seeing something beyond Black , something none of the rest could see , " — unless he was the one … unless you switched … without telling me ? " 
" Professor , " Harry interrupted loudly , " what's going on — ? " 
But he never finished the question , because what he saw made his voice die in his throat . 
The Professor walked to Black's side , seized his hand , pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor , and embraced Black like a brother . 
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach . 
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her . 
" You — you — " " Hermione — " " – you and him ! " " Hermione , calm down — " " I didn't tell anyone ! " 
Hermione shrieked . 
" I ' ve been covering up for you — " " Hermione , listen to me , please " Lupin shouted . 
" I trusted you , " he shouted at Lupin , his voice wavering , out of control , " and all the time you ' ve been his friend ! " 
" You ' re wrong , " said Lupin . 
" I haven't been Sirius's friend , but I am now — Let me explain … " " NO ! " Hermione screamed . 
" Harry , don't trust him , he's been helping Black get into the castle , he wants you dead too — he's a werewolf ! " 
There was a ringing silence . 
Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin , who looked remarkably calm , though rather pale . 
" Not at all up to your usual standard , Hermione , " he said . 
" Only one out of three , I'm afraid . 
I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don't want Harry dead . " 
" But I won't deny that I am a werewolf . " 
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain . 
Lupin made toward him , looking concerned , but Ron gasped , " Get away from me , werewolf ! " 
Lupin stopped dead . 
Then , with an obvious effort , he turned to Hermione and said , " How long have you known ? " " Ages , " Hermione whispered . 
" He ' ll be delighted , " said Lupin coolly . 
Or did you realize that the Boggart changed into the moon when it saw me ? " " Both , " Hermione said quietly . 
" You ' re the cleverest witch of your age I ' ve ever met , Hermione . " 
" I'm not , " Hermione whispered . 
" At least , the staff do . " 
" Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf , " Ron gasped . 
" He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy — " " AND HE WAS WRONG ! " 
Harry yelled . 
Ron edged away from both of them , dragging his leg . 
" I have not been helping Sirius , " said Lupin . 
" If you ' ll give me a chance , I ' ll explain . 
Look — " He separated Harry's , Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to its owner ; Harry caught his , stunned . 
Now will you listen ? " 
Harry didn't know what to think . 
Was it a trick ? 
" If you haven't been helping him , " he said , with a furious glance at Black , " how did you know he was here ? " 
" The map , " said Lupin . 
" The Marauder's Map . 
I was in my office examining it — " " You know how to work it ? " 
Harry said suspiciously . 
" Of course I know how to work it , " said Lupin , waving his hand impatiently . 
" I helped write it . 
I'm Moony — that was my friends ' nickname for me at school . " 
" You wrote — ? " " The important thing is , I was watching it carefully this evening , because I had an idea that you , Ron , and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his Hippogriff was executed . 
And I was right , wasn't I ? " 
" The point is , even if you ' re wearing an Invisibility Cloak , you still show up on the Marauder's Map . 
I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut . 
Twenty minutes later , you left Hagrid , and set off back toward the castle . 
" I thought the map must be malfunctioning . 
How could he be with you ? " " No one was with us ! " said Harry . 
" And then I saw another dot , moving fast toward you , labeled Sirius Black … I saw him collide with you ; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow — " " One of us ! " Ron said angrily . 
" No , Ron , " said Lupin . 
" Two of you . " 
He had stopped his pacing , his eyes moving over Ron . 
" Do you think I could have a look at the rat ? " he said evenly . 
" What ? " said Ron . " What's Scabbers got to do with it ? " 
" Could I see him , please ? " 
Ron hesitated , then put a hand inside his robes . 
Scabbers emerged , thrashing desperately ; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping . 
Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing noise . 
" What ? " 
" What's my rat got to do with anything ? " 
" That's not a rat , " croaked Sirius Black suddenly . 
" What d ' you mean — of course he's a rat — " " No , he's not , " said Lupin quietly . 
" He's a wizard . " 
" An Animagus , " said Black , " by the name of Peter Pettigrew . " 
It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in . 
Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking . 
" You ' re both mental . " 
" Ridiculous ! " said Hermione faintly . 
" Peter Pettigrew's dead ! " said Harry . 
" He killed him twelve years ago ! " 
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers ; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg . 
You can't do it just like that — they need to understand — we ' ve got to explain — " " We can explain afterwards ! " snarled Black , trying to throw Lupin off . 
One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers , who was squealing like a piglet , scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape . 
" Ron's kept him as a pet ! 
There are parts of it even I don't understand , and Harry — you owe Harry the truth , Sirius ! " Black stopped struggling , though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers , who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten , scratched , and bleeding hands . 
" Tell them whatever you like . 
I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for … " " You ' re nutters , both of you , " said Ron shakily , looking round at Harry and Hermione for support . 
" I ' ve had enough of this . 
I'm off . " 
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg , but Lupin raised his wand again , pointing it at Scabbers . 
" HE ' S NOT PETER , HE ' S SCABBERS ! " 
Ron yelled , trying to force the rat back into his front pocket , but Scabbers was fighting too hard ; Ron swayed and overbalanced , and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed . 
Then , ignoring Black , Harry turned to Lupin . 
" There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die , " he said . 
" Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter , " said Lupin , nodding . 
" I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight . 
Because the Marauder's map never lies … Peter's alive . 
Ron's holding him , Harry . " 
Harry looked down at Ron , and as their eyes met , they agreed , silently : Black and Lupin were both out of their minds . 
How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew ? 
Then Hermione spoke , in a trembling , would - be calm sort of voice , as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly . 
" But Professor Lupin … Scabbers can't be Pettigrew … it just can't be true , you know it can't … " " Why can't it be true ? " 
Lupin said calmly , as though they were in class , and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with Grindylows . 
" Because … because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus . 
We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall . 
And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals ; there's a register showing what animal they become , and their markings and things … and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register , and there have been only seven Animagi this century , and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list . " 
Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework , when Lupin started to laugh . 
" Right again , Hermione ! " he said . 
" I ' ve waited twelve years , I'm not going to wait much longer . " 
There had been a loud creak behind him . 
The bedroom door had opened of its own accord . 
All five of them stared at it . 
Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing . 
" No one there … " " This place is haunted ! " said Ron . 
" It's not , " said Lupin , still looking at the door in a puzzled way . 
" The Shrieking Shack was never haunted … The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me . " 
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes , thought for a moment then said , " That's where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf . 
Ron started to interrupt , but Hermione , said , " Shh ! " 
She was watching Lupin very intently . 
" I as a very small boy when I received the bite . 
The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery . 
It makes me safe , you see . 
As long as I take it in the week , preceding the full moon , I keep my mind when I transform … I'm able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf , and wait for the moon to wane again . 
" Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered , however , I became a fully fledged monster once a month . 
It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts . 
Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me . 
" But then Dumbledore became Headmaster , and he was sympathetic . 
He said that as long as we took certain precautions , there was no reason I shouldn't come to school … " Lupin sighed , and looked directly at Harry . 
" I told you , months ago , that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts . 
The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts . 
This house " — Lupin looked miserably around the room , — " the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use . 
Once a month , I was smuggled out of the castle , into this place , to transform . 
The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous . " 
Harry couldn't see where this story was going , but he was listening raptly all the same . 
The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking . 
It is very painful to turn into a werewolf . 
I was separated from humans to bite , so I bit and scratched myself instead . 
The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits . 
Dumbledore encouraged the rumor … Even now , when the house has been silent for years , the villagers don't dare approach it … " But apart from my transformations , I was happier than I had ever been in my life . 
For the first time ever , I had friends , three great friends . 
Sirius Black … Peter Pettigrew … and , of course , your father , Harry — James Potter . 
" Now , my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month . 
I made up all sorts of stories . 
I told them my mother was ill , and that I had to go home to see her … I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was . 
But of course , they , like you , Hermione , worked out the truth … " And they didn't desert me at all . 
Instead , they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable , but the best times of my life . 
They became Animagi . " 
" My dad too ? " said Harry , astounded . 
" Yes , indeed , " said Lupin . 
" It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it . 
Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school , and lucky they were , because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it . 
Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius . 
They could each turn into a different animal at will . " " But how did that help you ? " said Hermione , sounding puzzled . 
" A werewolf is only a danger to people . 
They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak . 
They transformed … Peter , as the smallest , could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it . 
They would then slip down the tunnel and join me . 
Under their influence , I became less dangerous . 
Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night . 
Sirius and James transformed into such large animals , they were able to keep a werewolf in check . 
I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did … And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map , and sign it with our nicknames . 
Sirius is Padfoot . 
Peter is Wormtail . 
" What sort of animal — ? " Harry began , but Hermione cut him off . 
Running around in the dark with a werewolf ! 
What if you'd given the others the slip , and bitten somebody ? " 
" And there were near misses , many of them . 
" I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust , of course … he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so , and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others'safety . 
But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's adventure . 
And I haven't changed … " Lupin's face had hardened , and there was self - disgust in his voice . 
" All this year , I have been battling with myself , wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus . 
But I didn't do it . 
Why ? 
Because I was too cowardly . 
It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school , admitting that I'd led others along with me … and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me . 
He let me into Hogwarts as a boy , and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life , unable to find paid work because of what I am . 
And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort , that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it … so , in a way , Snape's been right about me all along . " 
" Snape ? " said Black harshly , taking his eyes off Scabbers ; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin . 
" What's Snape got to do with it ? " 
" He's here , Sirius , " said Lupin heavily . 
He looked up at Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
" Professor Snape was at school with us . 
He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job . 
" It served him right , " he sneered . 
Lupin told Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
" We were in the same year , you know , and we — er — didn't like each other very much . 
He especially disliked James . 
Jealous , I think , of James's talent on the Quidditch field … anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform . 
Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing , to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick , and he'd be able to get in after me . 
He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody , but from that time on he knew what I was … " " So that's why Snape doesn't like you , " said Harry slowly , " because he thought you were in on the joke ? " " That's right , " sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin . 
Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak , his wand pointing directly at Lupin . 
Hermione screamed . 
Black leapt to his feet . 
" I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow , " said Snape , throwing the cloak aside , careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest . 
" Very useful , Potter , I thank you … " Snape was slightly breathless , but his face was full of suppressed triumph . 
" I ' ve just been to your office , Lupin . 
And very lucky I did … lucky for me , I mean . 
Lying on your desk was a certain map . 
One glance at it told me all I needed to know . 
I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight . " 
" I ' ve told the headmaster again and again that you ' re helping your old friend Black into the castle , Lupin , and here's the proof . 
Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout — " " Severus , you ' re making a mistake , " said Lupin urgently . 
" Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban ? " BANG ! Thin , snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth , wrists , and ankles ; he overbalanced and fell to the floor , unable to move . 
With a roar of rage , Black started toward Snape , but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes . 
" Give me a reason , " he whispered . 
" Give me a reason to do it , and I swear I will . " 
Black stopped dead . 
It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred . 
Harry stood there , paralyzed , not knowing what to do or whom to believe . 
He glanced around at Ron and Hermione . 
Ron looked just as confused as he did , still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers . 
Hermione , however , took an uncertain step toward Snape and said , in a very breathless voice , " Professor Snape — it wouldn't hurt to hear what they ' ve got to say , w - would it ? " 
" Miss Granger , you are already facing suspension from this school , " Snape spat . 
" You , Potter , and Weasley are out - of - bounds , in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf . 
" But if — if there was a mistake — " " KEEP QUIET , YOU STUPID GIRL ! " Snape shouted , looking suddenly quite deranged . 
A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand , which was still pointed at Black's face . 
Hermione fell silent . 
" Vengeance is very sweet , " Snape breathed at Black . 
" How I hoped I would be the one to catch you … " " The joke's on you again , Severus , " Black snarled . 
" As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle " — he jerked his head at Ron — " I ' ll come quietly … " " Up to the castle ? " said Snape silkily . 
" I don't think we need to go that far . 
All I have to do is call the Dementors once we get out of the Willow . 
" You — you ' ve got to hear me out , " he croaked . 
" The rat — look at the rat — " But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before . 
He clicked his fingers , and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands . 
" I ' ll drag the werewolf . 
Perhaps the Dementors will have a kiss for him too — " Before he knew what he was doing , Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door . 
" Get out of the way , Potter , you ' re in enough trouble already , " snarled Snape . 
" Get out of the way , Potter . " 
Harry yelled . 
" Like father , like son , Potter ! 
Harry made up his mind in a split second . 
Before Snape could take even one step toward him , he had raised his wand . 
" Expelliarmus ! " he yelled — except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted . 
There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges ; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall , then slid down it to the floor , a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair . 
Harry looked around . 
Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment . 
Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks . 
" You shouldn't have done that , " said Black , looking at Harry . 
" You should have left him to me … " Harry avoided Black's eyes . 
" We attacked a teacher … We attacked a teacher … " Hermione whimpered , staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes . 
" Oh , we ' re going to be in so much trouble — " Lupin was struggling against his bonds . 
Black bent down quickly and untied him . 
" Thank you , Harry , " he said . 
" I'm still not saying I believe you , " he told Lupin . 
Now . " Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest . 
" Come off it , " he said weakly . 
" Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers ? 
I mean … " He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support , " Okay , say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how's he supposed to know which one he is after if he was locked up in Azkaban ? " " You know , Sirius , that's a fair question , " said Lupin , turning to Black and frowning slightly . 
" How did you find out where he was ? " 
Black put one of his claw - like hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper , which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others . 
It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer , and there , on Ron's shoulder , was Scabbers . 
" How did you get this ? " 
Lupin asked Black , thunderstruck . 
" Fudge , " said Black . 
" When he came to inspect Azkaban last year , he gave me his paper . 
And there was Peter , on the front page on this boy's shoulder … I knew him at once … how many times had I seen him transform ? 
And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts … to where Harry was … " " My God , " said Lupin softly , staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again . 
" His front paw … " " What about it ? " said Ron defiantly . 
" He's got a toe missing , " said Black . 
" Of course , " Lupin breathed . 
" When I cornered him , he yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James . 
Then , before I could curse him , he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back , killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats … " " Didn't you ever hear , Ron ? " said Lupin . 
" I'd guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again … " " He's been scared of that mad cat ! " said Ron , nodding toward Crookshanks , who was still purring on the bed . 
He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head . 
" He's the most intelligent of his kind I ' ve ever met . 
He recognized Peter for what he was right away . 
And when he met me , he knew I was no dog . 
It was a while before he trusted me … Finally , I managed to communicate to him what I was after , and he's been helping me … " 
" What do you mean ? " breathed Hermione . 
" He tried to bring Peter to me , but couldn't … so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me … As I understand it , he took them from a boy's bedside table … " Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing . 
It was absurd … and yet … " But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it . " 
croaked Black . 
" This cat — Crookshanks , did you call him ? 
— told me Peter had left blood on the sheets … I supposed he bit himself … Well , faking his own death had worked once . " 
These words jolted Harry to his senses . 
" And why did he fake his death ? " he said furiously . 
" Then I should ' ve let Snape take you ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" Harry , " said Lupin hurriedly , " don't you see ? 
" Harry … I as good as killed them , " he croaked . 
" I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment , persuaded them to use him as Secret - Keeper instead of me … I'm to blame , I know it … The night they died , I'd arranged to check on Peter , make sure he was still safe , but when I arrived at his hiding place , he'd gone . 
Yet there was no sign of a struggle . 
I was scared . 
I set out for your parents ' house straight away . 
And when I saw their house , destroyed , and their bodies … I realized what Peter must ' ve done … what I'd done … " His voice broke . 
He turned away . 
" Enough of this , " said Lupin , and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before . 
" There's one certain way to prove what really happened . 
Ron , give me that rat . " " What are you going to do with him if I give him to you ? " Ron asked Lupin tensely . 
" Force him to show himself , " said Lupin . 
" If he really is a rat , it won't hurt him . " 
Ron hesitated . 
Scabbers began to squeak without stopping , twisting and turning , his tiny black eyes bulging in his head . 
" Ready , Sirius ? " said Lupin . 
Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed . 
He approached Lupin and the struggling rat , and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face . 
" Together ? " he said quietly . 
" I think so " , said Lupin , holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other . 
" On the count of three . 
One — two — THREE ! " 
A flash of blue - white light erupted from both wands ; for a moment , Scabbers was frozen in midair , his small gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the rat fell and hit the floor . 
There was another blinding flash of light and then — It was like watching a speeded - up film of a growing tree . 
A head was shooting upward from the ground ; limbs were sprouting ; a moment later , a man was standing where Scabbers had been , cringing and wringing his hands . 
Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed ; the hair on his back was standing up . 
He was a very short man , hardly taller than Harry and Hermione . 
He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time . 
His skin looked grubby , almost like Scabbers's fur , and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small , watery eyes . 
He looked around at them all , his breathing fast and shallow . 
Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again . 
" Long time , no see . " 
Again , his eyes darted toward the door . 
" We ' ve been having a little chat , Peter , about what happened the night Lily and James died . 
You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed — " " Remus , " gasped Pettigrew , and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face , " you don't believe him , do you … ? 
He tried to kill me , Remus … " 
" I'd like to clear up one or two little matters with you , Peter , if you ' ll be so — " " He's come to try and kill me again ! " 
Pettigrew squeaked suddenly , pointing at Black , and Harry saw that he used his middle finger , because his index was missing . 
" He killed Lily and James and now he's going to kill me too … You ' ve got to help me , Remus … " Black's face looked more skull - like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes . 
" I knew he'd come after me ! 
I knew he'd be back for me ! 
I ' ve been waiting for this for twelve years ! " " You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban ? " said Lupin , his brow furrowed . 
" When nobody has ever done it before ? " 
" He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of ! " Pettigrew shouted shrilly . 
" How else did he get out of there ? 
" Voldemort , teach me tricks ? " he said . 
Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him . 
" What , scared to hear your old master's name ? " said Black . 
" I don't blame you , Peter . 
His lot aren't very happy with you , are they ? " 
His whole face was shining with sweat now . 
I heard things in Azkaban , Peter … They all think you ' re dead , or you'd have to answer to them … I ' ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep . 
Voldemort went to the Potters ' on your information … and Voldemort met his downfall there . 
He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin . 
" You don't believe this — this madness , Remus — " 
" I must admit , Peter , I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat , " said Lupin evenly . 
" Innocent , but scared ! " squealed Pettigrew . 
" If Voldemort's supporters were after me , it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy , Sirius Black ! " Black's face contorted . 
" How dare you , " he growled , sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been . 
" I , a spy for Voldemort ? 
When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself ? 
But you , Peter — I ' ll never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start . 
You always liked big friends who'd look after you , didn't you ? 
It used to be us … me and Remus … and James … " Pettigrew wiped his face again ; he was almost panting for breath . 
" Me , a spy … must be out of your mind … never … don't know how you can say such a — " " Lily and James only made you Secret - Keeper because I suggested it , " Black hissed , so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward . 
" I thought it was the perfect plan … a bluff … Voldemort would be sure to come after me , would never dream they'd use a weak , talentless thing like you … It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life , telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters . " 
Pettigrew was muttering distractedly ; Harry caught words like " far - fetched " and " lunacy , " but he couldn't help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door . 
" Professor Lupin ? " said Hermione timidly . 
" Certainly , Hermione , " said Lupin courteously . 
" Well — Scabbers — I mean , this — this man — he's been sleeping in Harry's dormitory for three years . 
" Thank you ! 
You see , Remus ? 
I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head ! 
Why should I ? " " I ' ll tell you why , " said Black . 
" Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you . 
Voldemort's been in hiding for fifteen years , they say he's half dead . 
You weren't about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose , for a wreck of a wizard who'd lost all of his power , were you ? 
You'd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him , wouldn't you ? 
Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in ? Keeping an ear out for news , weren't you , Peter ? 
Just in case your old protector regained strength , and it was safe to rejoin him … " Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times . 
He seemed to have lost the ability to talk . 
" Er — Mr . Black — Sirius ? " said Hermione . 
Precisely what I — " But Lupin silenced him with a look . 
He seemed to be pondering his answer . 
" I don't know how I did it , " he said slowly . 
" I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent . 
That wasn't a happy thought , so the Dementors couldn't suck it out of me … but it kept me sane and knowing who I am … helped me keep my powers … so when it all became … too much … I could transform in my cell … become a dog . 
Dementors can't see , you know … " He swallowed . 
" They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions … They could tell that my feelings were less — less human , less complex when I was a dog … but they thought , of course , that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there , so it didn't trouble them . 
But I was weak , very weak , and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand … " But then I saw Peter in that picture … I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry … perfectly positioned to act , if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again … " Pettigrew was shaking his head , mouthing noiselessly , but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized . 
" … ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies … and to deliver the last Potter to them . 
If he gave them Harry , who'd dare say he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort ? 
He'd be welcomed back with honors … " So you see , I had to do something . 
I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive … " Harry remembered what Mr . Weasley had told Mrs . Wealsey . 
" The guards say he's been talking in his sleep … always the same words … ' He's at Hogwarts . ' " 
" It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head , and the Dementors couldn't destroy it … It wasn't a happy feeling … it was an obsession … but it gave me strength , it cleared my mind . 
So , one night when they opened my door to bring food , I slipped past them as a dog … It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused … I was thin , very thin … thin enough to slip through the bars … I swam as a dog back to the mainland … I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog . 
I ' ve been living in the forest ever since , except when I came to watch the Quidditch , of course . 
You fly as well as your father did , Harry … " He looked at Harry , who did not look away . 
" Believe me , " croaked Black . 
" Believe me , Harry . 
I never betrayed James and Lily . 
I would have died before I betrayed them . " 
And at long last , Harry believed him . 
" No ! " Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own death sentence . 
He shuffled forward on his knees , groveling , his hands clasped in front of him as though praying . 
" Sirius — it's me … it's Peter … your friend … you wouldn't — " Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled . 
" Remus ! " Pettigrew squeaked , turning to Lupin instead , writhing imploringly in front of him . 
" I assume that's why you didn't tell me , Sirius ? " he said casually over Pettigrew's head . 
" Forgive me , Remus , " said Black . 
" And will you , in turn , forgive me for believing you were the spy ? " " Of course , " said Black , and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face . 
He , too , began rolling up his sleeves . 
" Shall we kill him together ? " 
" Yes , I think so , " said Lupin grimly . 
You won't let them kill me , Ron , will you … you ' re on my side , aren't you ? " 
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion . 
" I let you sleep in my bed ! " he said . 
" If you made a better rat than a human , it's not much to boast about , Peter , " said Black harshly . 
Ron , going still paler with pain , wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach . 
Pettigrew turned on his knees , staggered forward , and seized the hem of Hermione's robes . 
" Sweet girl … clever girl … you — you won't let them … Help me … " Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed away against the wall , looking horrified . 
Pettigrew knelt , trembling uncontrollably , and turned his head slowly toward Harry . 
" Harry … Harry … you look just like your father … just like him … " " HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY ? " roared Black . 
He sat there , twitching with terror , staring up at them . 
" You sold Lily and James to Voldemort , " said Black , who was shaking too . 
" Do you deny it ? " 
" Sirius , Sirius , what could I have done ? 
The Dark Lord … you have no idea … he has weapons you can't imagine … I was scared , Sirius , I was never brave like you and Remus and James . 
" DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS , AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU ! " Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder , wands raised . 
" You should have realized , " said Lupin quietly , " if Voldemort didn't kill you , we would . 
Goodbye , Peter . " 
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall . 
" NO ! " Harry yelled . 
He ran forward , placing himself in front Pettigrew , facing the wands . 
" You can't . " 
Black and Lupin both looked staggered . 
" Harry , this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents , " Black snarled . 
You heard him . 
" I know , " Harry panted . 
" We ' ll take him up to the castle . 
We ' ll hand him over to the Dementors … He can go to Azkaban … but don't kill him . " 
" Harry ! " gasped Pettigrew , and he flung his arms around Harry's knees . 
" You — thank you — it's more than I deserve — thank you — " " Get off me , " Harry spat , throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in disgust . 
" I'm not doing this for you . 
Black and Lupin were looking at each other . 
Then , with one movement , they lowered their wands . 
" You ' re the only person who has the right to decide , Harry , " said Black . 
" But think … think what he did … " " He can go to Azkaban , " Harry repeated . 
" If anyone deserves that place , he does … " Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him . 
" Stand aside , Harry . " 
Harry hesitated . 
" I'm going to tie him up , " said Lupin . 
" That's all , I swear . " 
Harry stepped out of the way . 
Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this time , and next moment , Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor , bound and gagged . 
" But if you transform , Peter , " growled Black , his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too , " we will kill you . 
You agree , Harry ? " 
Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him . 
" Right , " said Lupin , suddenly businesslike . 
" Ron , I can't mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey , so I think it's best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing . " 
He hurried over to Ron , bent down , tapped Ron's leg with his wand , and muttered , " Ferula . " 
Lupin helped him to his feet ; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince . 
" That's better , " he said . 
" Thanks . " 
" What about Professor Snape ? " said Hermione in a small voice , looking down at Snape's prone figure . 
" You were just a little — overenthusiastic . 
Still out cold . 
As though invisible strings were tied to Snape's wrists , neck , and knees , he was pulled into a standing position , head still lolling unpleasantly , like a grotesque puppet . 
He hung a few inches above the ground , his limp feet dangling . 
Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket . 
" And two of us should be chained to this , " said Black , nudging Pettigrew with his toe . 
" Just to make sure . " 
" I ' ll do it , " said Lupin . 
" And me , " said Ron savagely , limping forward . 
Ron's face was set . 
He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a personal insult . 
Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room , his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high . 
Harry had never been part of a stranger group . 
Crookshanks led the way down the stairs ; Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron went next , looking like entrants in a six - legged race . 
Harry and Hermione brought up the rear . 
Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron had to turn sideways to manage it ; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand . 
Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file . 
Crookshanks was still in the lead . 
Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this . 
" You know what this means ? " 
Black said abruptly to Harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel . 
" Turning Pettigrew in ? " " You ' re free , " said Harry . 
" Yes … " said Black . 
" But I'm also — I don't know if anyone ever told you — I'm your godfather . " 
" Yeah , I knew that , " said Harry . 
" If anything happened to them … " Harry waited . 
Did Black mean what he thought he meant ? 
" I ' ll understand , of course , if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle , " said Black . 
" But … well … think about it . 
" What — live with you ? " he said , accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling . 
" Leave the Dursleys ? " 
" Of course , I thought you wouldn't want to , " said Black quickly . 
" I understand , I just thought I'd — " " Are you insane ? " said Harry , his voice easily as croaky as Black's . 
" Of course I want to leave the Dursleys ! 
Have you got a house ? 
When can I move in ? " Black turned right around to look at him ; Snape's head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn't seem to care . 
" You want to ? " he said . 
" You mean it ? " 
" Yeah , I mean it ! " said Harry . 
The difference it made was startling , as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask ; for a moment , he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents ' wedding . 
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel . 
Crookshanks darted up first ; he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk , because Lupin , Pettigrew , and Ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches . 
Black saw Snape up through the hole , then stood back for Harry and Hermione to pass . 
The grounds were very dark now ; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle . 
Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering . 
Harry's mind was buzzing . 
He was going to leave the Dursleys . 
He was going to live with Sirius Black , his parents ' best friend … He felt dazed … What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they'd seen on television … ! 
His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest . 
Silently they tramped through the grounds , the castle lights growing slowly larger . 
Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black , his chin bumping on his chest . 
There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground . 
Black froze . 
He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop . 
Harry could see Lupin's silhouette . 
" Oh , my — " Hermione gasped . 
He's not safe ! " 
" Run , " Black whispered . 
" Run . 
Now . " 
But Harry couldn't run . 
Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin . 
He leapt forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back . 
" Leave it to me — RUN ! " 
There was a terrible snarling noise . 
So was his body . 
His shoulders were hunching . 
As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it , the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward , away from Ron and Pettigrew . 
Harry stood , transfixed by the sight , too intent upon the battle to notice anything else . 
It was Hermione's scream that alerted him — Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand . 
Ron , unsteady on his bandaged leg , fell . 
There was a bang , a burst of light — and Ron lay motionless on the ground . 
Another bang — Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap . 
" Expelliarmus . " 
Harry yelled , pointing his own wand at Pettigrew ; Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight . 
" Stay where you are ! " Harry shouted , running forward . 
Too late . 
Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass . 
There was a howl and a rumbling growl ; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight ; it was galloping into the forest — " Sirius , he's gone , Pettigrew transformed ! " 
Harry yelled . 
Black was bleeding ; there were gashes across his muzzle and back , but at Harry's words he scrambled up again , and in an instant , the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds . 
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron . " What did he do to him ? " 
Hermione whispered . 
Ron's eyes were only half - closed , his mouth hung open ; he was definitely alive , they could hear him breathing , but he didn't seem to recognize them . 
" I don't know … " Harry looked desperately around . 
Black and Lupin both gone … they had no one but Snape for company , still hanging , unconscious , in midair . 
" We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone , " said Harry , pushing his hair out of his eyes , trying to think straight . 
" Come — " But then , from beyond the range of their vision , they heard a yelping , a whining : a dog in pain … " Sirius , " Harry muttered , staring into the darkness . 
He had a moment's indecision , but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment , and by the sound of it , Black was in trouble — 
Harry set off at a run , Hermione right behind him . 
The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake . 
As they reached the lakeshore , they saw why — Sirius had turned back into a man . 
He was crouched on all fours , his hands over his head . 
" Nooo … please … " And then Harry saw them . 
Dementors , at least a hundred of them , gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them . 
Harry yelled , raising his wand , blinking furiously to try and clear his vision , shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it — I'm going to live with my godfather . 
I'm leaving the Dursleys . 
He forced himself to think of Black , and only Black , and began to chant : " Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto patronum ! " 
Black gave a shudder , rolled over , and lay motionless on the ground , pale as death . 
I'm going to go and live with him . 
" Expecto patronum ! 
Hermione , help me ! 
Expecto patronum ! " 
They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione , and were getting closer … " EXPECTO PATRONUM ! " 
Harry yelled , trying to blot the screaming from his ears . 
" EXPECTO PATRONUM ! " 
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him . 
At the same moment , Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him . 
He was alone … completely alone … " Expecto — expecto patronum — " Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass . 
Fog was clouding his eyes . 
With a huge effort , he fought to remember — Sirius was innocent — innocent — We ' ll be okay — I'm going to live with him — " Expecto patronum ! " he gasped . 
A dead , slimy hand slid out from under the cloak . 
It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside . 
" No — no — " Harry gasped . 
The nearest Dementor seemed to be considering him . 
Where there should have been eyes , there was only thin , gray scabbed skin , stretched blankly over empty sockets . 
But there was a mouth … a gaping , shapeless hole , sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle . 
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak . 
He had to fight … expecto patronum … he couldn't see … and in the distance , he heard the familiar screaming … expecto patronum … he groped in the mist for Sirius , and found his arm … they weren't going to take him … But a pair of strong , clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry's neck . 
They were forcing his face upward … He could feel its breath … It was going to get rid of him first … He could feel its putrid breath … His mother was screaming in his ears … She was going to be the last thing he ever heard — And then , through the fog that was drowning him , he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter … He felt himself fall forward onto the grass … Facedown , too weak to move , sick and shaking , Harry opened his eyes . 
The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him … The screaming had stopped , the cold was ebbing away … Something was driving the Dementors back … It was circling around him and Black and Hermione … They were leaving … The air was warm again … With every ounce of strength he could muster , Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light , galloping away across the lake … Eyes blurred with sweat , Harry tried to make out what it was … It was as bright as a unicorn … Fighting to stay conscious , Harry watched it can'ter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore . 
He felt the last of his strength leave him , and his head hit the ground as he fainted . 
" Shocking business … shocking … miracle none of them died … never heard the like … by thunder , it was lucky you were there , Snape … " " Thank you , Minister . " 
First Class , if I can wangle it ! " 
" Thank you very much indeed , Minister . " 
They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent . 
They ' ve got away with a great deal before now … I'm afraid it's given them a rather high opinion of themselves … and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster — " " Ah , well , Snape … Harry Potter , you know … we ' ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he's concerned . " 
And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such danger . 
Consider , Minister — against all school rules — after all the precautions put in place for his protection — out - of - bounds , at night , consorting with a werewolf and a murderer — and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too — " " Well , well … we shall see , Snape , we shall see … The boy has undoubtedly been foolish … " Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut . 
He felt very groggy . 
The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain , so that it was difficult to understand … His limbs felt like lead ; his eyelids too heavy to lift … He wanted to lie here , on this comfortable bed , forever … " What amazes me most is the behavior of the Dementors … you ' ve really no idea what made them retreat , Snape ? " " No , Minister … by the time I had come ' round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances … " " Extraordinary . 
And yet Black , and Harry , and the girl — " 
I bound and gagged Black , naturally , conjured stretchers , and brought them all straight back to the castle . " 
There was a pause . 
Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster , and as it did , a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach … He opened his eyes . 
Somebody had removed his glasses . 
He was lying in the dark hospital wing . 
At the very end of the ward , he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him , bending over a bed . 
Harry squinted . 
Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm . 
Harry moved his head over on the pillow . 
In the bed to his right lay Hermione . 
Her eyes were open too . 
She looked petrified , and when she saw that Harry was awake , pressed a finger to her lips , then pointed to the hospital wing door . 
It was ajar , and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside . 
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's bed . 
He turned to took at her . 
It looked like a small boulder . 
" Ah , you ' re awake ! " she said briskly . 
She placed the chocolate on Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer . 
" How's Ron ? " said Harry and Hermione together . 
" He ' ll live , " said Madam Pomfrey grimly . 
" As for you two , you ' ll be staying here until I'm satisfied you ' re — Potter , what do you think you ' re doing ? " 
Harry was sitting up , putting his glasses back on , and picking up his wand . 
" I need to see the headmaster , " he said . 
They ' ve got Black . 
He's locked away upstairs . 
Harry jumped up out of bed ; Hermione had done the same . 
But his shout had been heard in the corridor outside ; next second , Cornelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward . 
" Harry , Harry , what's this ? " said Fudge , looking agitated . 
" Minister , listen ! " 
Harry said . 
" Sirius Black's innocent ! 
Peter Pettigrew faked his own death ! 
We saw him tonight ! 
You can't let the Dementors do that thing to Sirius , he's — " But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face . 
" Harry , Harry , you ' re very confused , you ' ve been through a dreadful ordeal , lie back down , now , we ' ve got everything under control … " " YOU HAVEN ' T ! " Harry yelled . 
" I saw him too . 
It was Ron's rat , he's an Animagus , Pettigrew , I mean , and — " " You see , Minister ? " said Snape . 
Harry roared . 
" Minister ! 
Professor ! " said Madam Pomfrey angrily . 
" I must insist that you leave . 
Potter is my patient , and he should not be distressed ! " 
" I'm not distressed , I'm trying to tell them what happened ! " 
Harry said furiously . 
" Now , please , Minister , these children need care . 
Please leave . " 
The door opened again . 
It was Dumbledore . 
Harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again . 
" Professor Dumbledore , Sirius Black — " " For heaven's sake ! " said Madam Pomfrey hysterically . 
" Is this a hospital wing or not ? 
" I have just been talking to Sirius Black — " " I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's mind ? " spat Snape . 
" And does my evidence count for nothing ? " snarled Snape . 
" Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack , nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds . " 
" That was because you were knocked out , Professor ! " said Hermione earnestly . 
" Now , Snape , " said Fudge , startled , " the young lady is disturbed in her mind , we must make allowances — " " I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , " said Dumbledore abruptly . 
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward , slamming the door behind her . 
Fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat . 
" I ' ll go and meet them . 
Dumbledore , I ' ll see you upstairs . " 
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape , but Snape hadn't moved . 
" You surely don't believe a word of Black's story ? " 
Snape whispered , his eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face . 
" I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , " Dumbledore repeated . 
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore . 
" Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen , " he breathed . 
Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding . 
It closed behind them , and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione . 
They both burst into speech at the same time . 
" It is your turn to listen , and I beg you will not interrupt me , because there is very little time , " he said quietly . 
" There is not a shred of proof to support Black's story , except your word — and the word of two thirteen - year - old wizards will not convince anybody . 
A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew . 
I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters ' Secret - Keeper . " " Professor Lupin can tell you — " Harry said , unable to stop himself " Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest , unable to tell anyone anything . 
By the time he is human again , it will be too late , Sirius will be worse than dead . 
I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends — " " But — " " Listen to me , Harry . 
It is too late , you understand me ? 
You must see that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than yours . " 
" He hates Sirius , " Hermione said desperately . 
The attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife — without Pettigrew , alive or dead , we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence . " 
" But you believe us . " " Yes , I do , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" But I have no power to make other men see the truth , or to overrule the Minister of Magic … " Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away . 
He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything . 
" What we need , " said Dumbledore slowly , and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione , " is more time . " 
" But — " Hermione began . 
" OH ! " " Now , pay attention , " said Dumbledore , speaking very low , and very clearly . 
" Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh floor . 
Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower . 
If all goes well , you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight . 
But remember this , both of you : you must not be seen . 
Miss Granger , you know the law — you know what is at stake … You — must — not — be — seen . " 
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on . 
Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door . 
" I am going to lock you in . 
Miss Granger , three turns should do it . 
Good luck . " 
" Good luck ? " 
Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore . 
" Three turns ? 
What's he talking about ? 
What are we supposed to do ? " 
" Harry , come here , " she said urgently . 
Harry moved toward her , completely bewildered . 
She was holding the chain out . 
" Ready ? " she said breathlessly . 
" What are we doing ? " 
Harry said , completely lost . 
The dark ward dissolved . 
Harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast , backward . 
A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him , his ears were pounding , he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice — And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet , and everything came into focus again — He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors . 
He looked wildly around at Hermione , the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck . 
" Hermione , what — ? " " In here ! " 
Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet ; she opened it , pushed him inside among the buckets and mops , then slammed the door behind them . 
" What — how — Hermione , what happened ? " 
" We ' ve gone back in time , " Hermione whispered , lifting the chain off Harry's neck in the darkness . 
It hurt a lot , which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream . 
" But — " 
" Shh ! Listen ! 
Someone's coming ! 
I think — I think it might be us ! " 
Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door . 
" Footsteps across the hall … yes , I think it's us going down to Hagrid's ! " " Are you telling me , " Harry whispered , " that we ' re here in this cupboard and we ' re out there too ? " " Yes , " said Hermione , her ear still glued to the cupboard door . 
" I'm sure it's us . 
" We ' ve gone down the front steps … " Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket , looking desperately anxious , but Harry wanted a few questions answered . 
I ' ve been using it all year to get to all my lessons . 
She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one . 
She had to tell them that I was a model student , and that I'd never , ever use it for anything except my studies … I ' ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again , that's how I ' ve been doing several lessons at once , see ? 
But … " Harry , I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do . 
Why did he tell us to go back three hours ? 
How's that going to help Sirius ? " 
Harry stared at her shadowy face . 
" There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change , " he said slowly . 
" What happened ? 
We were walking down to Hagrid's three hours ago … " " This is three hours ago , and we are walking down to Hagrid's , " said Hermione . 
" Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent life … " And then it hit him . 
" Hermione , we ' re going to save Buckbeak ! " " But — how will that help Sirius ? " 
" Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick's office ! 
Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together ! " 
From what Harry could see of Hermione's face , she looked terrified . 
" If we manage that without being seen , it ' ll be a miracle ! " " Well , we ' ve got to try , haven't we ? " said Harry . 
He stood up and pressed his ear against the door . 
" Doesn't sound like anyone's there … Come on , let's go . " 
Harry pushed open the closet door . 
As quietly and quickly as they could , they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps . 
The shadows were already lengthening , the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold . 
" If anyone's looking out of the window — " Hermione squeaked , looking up at the castle behind them . 
" We ' ll run for it , " said Harry determinedly . 
We ' ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout — " " Okay , but we ' ll go around by the greenhouses !'said Hermione breathlessly . 
" We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door , or we ' ll see us ! 
They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses , paused for a moment behind them , then set off again , fast as they could , skirting around the Whomping Willow , tearing toward the shelter of the forest … Safe in the shadows of the trees , Harry turned around ; seconds later , Hermione arrived beside him , panting . 
" Right , " she gasped . 
" We need to sneak over to Hagrid's … Keep out of sight , Harry … " They made their way silently through the trees , keeping to the very edge of the forest . 
Then , as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house , they heard a knock upon his door . 
And Harry heard his own voice . 
" It's us . 
We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak . 
He stood back , then shut the door quickly . 
" This is the weirdest thing we ' ve ever done , " Harry said fervently . 
" Let's move along a bit , " Hermione whispered . 
" We need to get nearer to Buckbeak ! " 
They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous Hippogriff , tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch . 
" Now ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" No ! " said Hermione . 
This was starting to seem impossible . 
At that moment , there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's cabin . 
" That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug , " Hermione whispered . 
" I'm going to find Scabbers in a moment — " Sure enough , a few minutes later , they heard Hermione's shriek of surprise . 
" Hermione , " said Harry suddenly , " what if we — we just run in there and grab Pettigrew — " " No ! " said Hermione in a terrified whisper . 
" Don't you understand ? 
We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws ! 
You heard Dumbledore , if we ' re seen — " " We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid ! " " Harry , what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid's house ? " said Hermione . 
" I'd — I'd think I'd gone mad , " said Harry , " or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on — " " Exactly ! 
You wouldn't understand , you might even attack yourself ! 
Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors . 
Dumbledore , Fudge , the old Committee member , and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps . 
" We're about to come out ! " Hermione breathed . 
And sure enough , moments later , Hagrid's back door opened , and Harry saw himself , Ron , and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid . 
It was , without a doubt , the strangest sensation of his life , standing behind the tree , and watching himself in the pumpkin patch . 
" It's Okay , Beaky , it's okay … " Hagrid said to Buckbeak . 
Then he turned to Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
Get goin ' . " 
" Hagrid , we can't — " " We ' ll tell them what really happened — " " They can't kill him — " 
Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron . 
Don ' listen … " There was a knock on Hagrid's front door . 
Hagrid turned , around and headed back into his cabin , leaving the back door ajar . 
Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating . 
He , Ron , and Hermione had gone … but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door . 
" Where is the beast ? " came the cold voice of Macnair . 
" Out — outside , " Hagrid croaked . 
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at Hagrid's window , staring out at Buckbeak . 
Then they heard Fudge . 
" We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution , Hagrid . 
I ' ll make it quick . 
And then you and Macnair need to sign it . 
Macnair , You ' re supposed to listen too , that's procedure -- " Macnair's face vanished from the window . 
It was now or never . 
" Wait here , " Harry whispered to Hermione . 
" I ' ll do it . " 
As Fudge's voice started again , Harry darted out from behind his tree , vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch , and approached Buckbeak . 
" It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the Hippogriff Buckbeak , hereafter called the condemned , shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown — " Careful not to blink , Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed . 
Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again . 
Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence . 
" Well , let's get this over with , " said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid's cabin . 
" No , I — I wan'ter be with him … I don ' wan ' him ter be alone — " Footsteps echoed from within the cabin . 
" Buckbeak , move ! " 
Harry hissed . 
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck . 
The Hippogriff began to walk , rustling its wings irritably . 
They were still ten feet away from the forest , in plain view of Hagrid's back door . 
" One moment , please , Macnair , " came Dumbledore's voice . 
" You need to sign too . " 
The footsteps stopped . 
Harry heaved on the rope . 
Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster . 
Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree . 
" Harry , hurry ! " she mouthed . 
Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin . 
They had reached the trees … " Quick ! 
Quick ! " Hermione moaned , darting out from behind her tree , seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster . 
Harry looked over his shoulder ; they were now blocked from sight ; they couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all . 
" Stop ! " he whispered to Hermione . 
" They might hear us . " 
Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang . 
Harry , Hermione , and Buckbeak stood quite still ; even the Hippogriff seemed to be listening intently . 
Silence … then — " Where is it ? " said the reedy voice of the Committee member . 
" Where is the beast ? " " It was tied here ! " said the executioner furiously . 
" I saw it ! 
Just here ! " 
" How extraordinary , " said Dumbledore . 
There was a note of amusement in his voice . 
" Beaky ! " said Hagrid huskily . 
There was a swishing noise , and the thud of an axe . 
The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger . 
And then came the howling , and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs . 
" Gone ! 
Beaky , yeh clever boy ! " Buckbeak started to strain against the rope , trying to get back to Hagrid . 
Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him . 
" We should search the grounds , the forest . " 
" Search the skies , if you will … Hagrid , I could do with a cup of tea . 
" Come in , come in … " Harry and Hermione listened closely . 
They heard footsteps , the soft cursing of the executioner , the snap of the door , and then silence once more . 
" Now what ? " whispered Harry , looking around . 
" We ' ll have to hide in here , " said Hermione , who looked very shaken . 
" We need to wait until they ' ve gone back to the castle . 
Then we wait until it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window . 
He won't be there for another couple of hours … Oh , this is going to be difficult … " She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest . 
" We're going to have to move , " said Harry , thinking hard . 
" We ' ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow , or we won't know what's going on . " 
" But we ' ve got to keep out of sight , Harry , remember … " They moved around the edge of the forest , darkness falling thickly around them , until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow . 
" There's Ron ! " said Harry suddenly . 
A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air . 
Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron . 
Then he saw Ron dive . 
The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow . 
They saw him bowl Harry over , then seize on … " Looks even worse from here , doesn't it ? " said Harry , watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots . 
And then the tree froze . 
" That was Crookshanks pressing the knot , " said Hermione . 
" And there we go … " Harry muttered . 
" We're in . " 
The moment they disappeared , the tree began to move again . 
Seconds later , they heard footsteps quite close by . 
Dumbledore , Macnair , Fudge , and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle . 
" I bet you anything Fudge would ' ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot … " They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view . 
For a few minutes the scene was deserted . 
Then — " Here comes Lupin ! " said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and halting toward the Willow . 
Harry looked up at the sky . 
Clouds were obscuring the moon completely . 
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk . 
" If he'd only grabbed the cloak , " said Harry . 
" It's just lying there … " He turned to Hermione . 
" How can you stand this ? " he asked Hermione fiercely . 
" Just standing here and watching it happen ? " 
He hesitated . 
" I'm going to grab the cloak ! " " Harry , no ! " Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon . 
Just then , they heard a burst of song . 
It was Hagrid , making his way up to the castle , singing at the top of his voice , and weaving slightly as he walked . 
" See ? " Hermione whispered . 
" See what would have happened ? 
No , Buckbeak ! " 
The Hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again ; Harry seized his rope too , straining to hold Buckbeak back . 
They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle . 
He was gone . 
Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away . 
Barely two minutes later , the castle doors flew open yet again , and Snape came charging out of them , running toward the Willow . 
Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree , looking around . 
He grabbed the cloak and held it up . 
" Shh ! " Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree , prodded the knot , and vanished from view as he put on the cloak . 
" So that's it , " said Hermione quietly . 
" We're all down there … and now we ' ve just got to wait until we come back up again … " She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree , then sat down on the dry ground , arms around her knees . 
I remember them coming , and then I think I passed out … there were so many of them … " Harry sat down too . 
He explained what he'd seen ; how , as the nearest Dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's , a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the Dementors to retreat . 
Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished . 
" But what was it ? " 
" A real Patronus . 
A powerful one . " 
" But who conjured it ? " 
Harry didn't say anything . 
He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake . 
" Was it one of the teachers ? " 
" No , " said Harry . 
" He wasn't a teacher . " 
Couldn't you see — ? " " Yeah , I saw him , " said Harry slowly . 
" But … maybe I imagined it … I wasn't thinking straight … I passed out right afterward … " " Who did you think it was ? " " I think — " Harry swallowed , knowing how strange this was going to sound . 
" I think it was my dad . " 
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now . 
She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity . 
" Harry , your dad's — well — dead , " she said quietly . 
" I know that , " said Harry quickly . 
" I don't know … no … he looked solid … " " But then — " " Maybe I was seeing things , " said Harry . 
" But … from what I could see … it looked like him … I ' ve got photos of him … " Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity . 
" I know it sounds crazy , " said Harry flatly . 
He turned to took at Buckbeak , who was digging his beak into the ground , apparently searching for worms . 
He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest friends … Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs … Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight ? 
The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds . 
Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow , waiting . 
And then , at last , after over an hour … " Here we come ! " 
Hermione whispered . 
She and Harry got to their feet . 
Buckbeak raised his head . 
They saw Lupin , Ron , and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots . 
Next came Harry and Black . 
They all began to walk toward the castle . 
Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast . 
He glanced up at the sky . 
We mustn't be seen . 
" How do you expect to find a rat in the dark ? " snapped Hermione . 
" There's nothing we can do ! 
We came back to help Sirius ; we ' re not supposed to be doing anything else ! " 
" All right ! " 
The moon slid out from behind its cloud . 
They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop . 
Then they saw movement — " There goes Lupin , " Hermione whispered . 
" He's transforming . " 
" Hermione ! " said Harry suddenly . 
" We ' ve got to move ! " " We mustn't , I keep telling you — " " Not to interfere ! 
Lupin's going to run into the forest , right at us ! " Hermione gasped . 
Where are we going to go ? 
Where are we going to hide ? 
Harry said . 
" It's empty now — come on ! " 
They ran as fast as they could , Buckbeak cantering along behind them . 
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them … The cabin was in sight ; Harry skidded to the door , wrenched it open , and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him ; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door . 
Fang the boarhound barked loudly . 
" That was really close ! " she said to Harry . 
" Yeah … " Harry was looking out of the window . 
It was much harder to see what was going on from here . 
Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid's house . 
He lay down in front of the fire , folded his wings contentedly , and seemed ready for a good nap . 
" I think I'd better go outside again , you know , " said Harry slowly . 
" I can't see what's going on — we won't know when it's time — " Hermione looked up . 
" I'm not going to try and interfere , " said Harry quickly . 
" But if we don't see what's going on , how ' re we going to know when it's time to rescue Sirius ? " " Well … okay , then … I ' ll wait here with Buckbeak … but Harry , be careful — there's a werewolf out there — and the Dementors . " 
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin . 
He could hear yelping in the distance . 
Harry stared out toward the lake , his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest … Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment … For a fraction of a second he stood , irresolute , in front of Hagrid's door . 
You must not be seen . 
But he didn't want to be seen . 
He wanted to do the seeing … He had to know … And there were the Dementors . 
They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction , gliding around the edges of the lake … They were moving away from where Harry stood , to the opposite bank … He wouldn't have to get near them … Harry began to run . 
He had no thought in his head except his father … If it was him … if it really was him … he had to know , had to find out … The lake was coming nearer and nearer , but there was no sign of anybody . 
On the opposite bank , he could see tiny glimmers of silver — his own attempts at a Patronus — There was a bush at the very edge of the water . 
On the opposite bank , the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished . 
" Where are you ? 
Dad , come on — " But no one came . 
Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the lake . 
It was time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time — And then it hit him — he understood . 
He hadn't seen his father he had seen himself — Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand . 
" EXPECTO PATRONUM ! " he yelled . 
And out of the end of his wand burst , not a shapeless cloud of mist , but a blinding , dazzling , silver animal . 
He screwed up his eyes , trying to see what it was . 
It looked like a horse . 
It was galloping silently away from him , across the black surface of the lake . 
He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming Dementors … Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground , and the Dementors were falling back , scattering , retreating into the darkness … They were gone . 
The Patronus turned . 
It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water . 
It wasn't a horse . 
It was a stag . 
It was shining brightly as the moon above … it was coming back to him … It stopped on the bank . 
Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large , silver eyes . 
And Harry realized … " Prongs , " he whispered . 
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature , it vanished . 
Harry stood there , hand still outstretched . 
Then , with a great leap of his heart , he heard hooves behind him . 
He whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward him , dragging Buckbeak behind her . 
" What did you do ? " she said fiercely . 
" You said you were only going to keep a lookout ! " " I just saved all our lives … " said Harry . 
" Get behind here behind this bush — I ' ll explain . " 
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again . 
" Did anyone see you ? " " Yes , haven't you been listening ? 
I saw me but I thought I was my dad ! 
It's okay ! " " Harry , I can't believe it … You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those Dementors ! 
That's very , very advanced magic . " 
" I knew I could do it this time , " said Harry , " because I'd already done it … Does that make sense ? " 
" I don't know — Harry , look at Snape ! " Together they peered around the bush at the other bank . 
He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry , Hermione , and Black onto them . 
" We ' ve got about fortyfive minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing . 
We ' ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we ' re missing … " They waited , watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake , while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze . 
Buckbeak , bored , was ferreting for worms again . 
He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower . 
" Look ! " Hermione whispered . 
" Who's that ? 
Someone's coming back out of the castle ! " 
Harry stared through the darkness . 
The man was hurrying across the grounds , toward one of the entrances . 
" Macnair ! " said Harry . 
" The executioner ! 
He's gone to get the Dementors ! 
This is it , Hermione — " 
Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her a leg up . 
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her . 
He pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins . 
" Ready ? " he whispered to Hermione . 
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air . 
Harry gripped his flanks with his knees , feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them . 
They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle … Harry pulled hard on the left - hand side of the rope , and Buckbeak turned . 
Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past — " Whoa ! " he said , pulling backward as hard as he could . 
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop , unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the Hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne . 
" He's there ! " 
Harry said , spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window . 
He reached out , and as Buckbeak's wings fell , was able to tap sharply on the glass . 
Black looked up . 
Harry saw his jaw drop . 
He leapt from his chair , hurried to the window and tried to open it , but it was locked . 
" Stand back ! " Hermione called to him , and she took out her wand , still gripping the back of Harry's robes with her left hand . 
" Alohomora ! " 
The window sprang open . 
" How — how — ? " said Black weakly , staring at the Hippogriff . 
" You ' ve got to get out of here — the Dementors are coming — Macnair's gone to get them . " 
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it . 
It was very lucky he was so thin . 
" Okay , Buckbeak , up ! " said Harry , shaking the rope . 
" Up to the tower — come on . " 
The Hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again , high as the top of the West Tower . 
Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements , and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once . 
" They ' ll reach Flitwick's office any moment , they ' ll find out you ' re gone . " 
Buckbeak pawed the ground , tossing his sharp head . 
" What happened to the other boy ? 
Ron ? " croaked Sirius . 
" He's going to be okay . 
He's still out of it , but Madam Pomfrey says she ' ll be able to make him better . 
Quick — go — " But Black was still staring down at Harry . 
" How can I ever thank — " " GO ! " Harry and Hermione shouted together . 
" You are — truly your father's son , Harry … " He squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his heels . 
Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more … The Hippogriff took off into the air … He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them … then a cloud drifted across the moon … They were gone . 
" Harry ! " Hermione was tugging at his sleeve , staring at her watch . 
" We ' ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door — " " Okay , " said Harry , wrenching his gaze from the sky , " let's go … " They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase . 
As they reached the bottom of it , they heard voices . 
It sounded like Fudge and Snape . 
They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase . 
" As soon as Macnair returns with the Dementors . 
I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we ' ve got him at last … I daresay they ' ll want to interview you , Snape … and once young Harry's back in his right mind , I expect he ' ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him … " Harry clenched his teeth . 
He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place . 
Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd really gone , then started to run in the opposite direction . 
Harry muttered , grabbing Hermione's wrist . 
" In here ! " 
Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits , laughing his head off . 
" Oh , he's horrible , " whispered Hermione , her ear to the door . 
" I bet he's all excited because the Dementors are going to finish off Sirius … " She checked her watch . 
" Three minutes , Harry ! " 
They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance , then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again . 
" Hermione — what ' ll happen — if we don't get back inside before Dumbledore locks the door ? " 
Harry panted . 
" I don't want to think about it ! " 
Hermione moaned , checking her watch again . 
" One minute ! " 
They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance . 
" Okay — I can hear Dumbledore , " said Hermione tensely . 
" Come on , Harry ! " 
They crept along the corridor . 
The door opened . 
Dumbledore's back appeared . 
" I am going to lock you in , " they heard him saying . 
" it is five minutes to midnight . 
Miss Granger , three turns should do it . 
Good luck . " 
Dumbledore backed out of the room , closed the door , and took out his wand to magically lock it . 
Panicking , Harry and Hermione ran forward . 
Dumbledore looked up , and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache . 
" Well ? " he said quietly . 
" We did it ! " said Harry breathlessly . 
" Well done . 
It was empty except for Ron , who was still lying motionless in the end bed . 
As the lock clicked behind them , Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds , Hermione tucking the Time - Turner back under her robes . 
A moment later , Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office . 
" Did I hear the headmaster leaving ? 
Am I allowed to look after my patients now ? " 
She was in a very bad mood . 
Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly . 
But Harry could hardly swallow . 
Now they could hear angry voices , growing louder and louder . 
Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door . 
What do they think they ' re doing ? " 
Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying . 
We should have left somebody in the room with him . 
The door of the hospital wing burst open . 
Fudge , Snape , and Dumbledore came striding into the ward . 
Dumbledore alone looked calm . 
Indeed , he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself . 
Fudge appeared angry . 
But Snape was beside himself . 
" WHAT DID YOU DO ? " " Professor Snape ! " shrieked Madam Pomfrey . 
" See here , Snape , be reasonable , " said Fudge . 
" This door's been locked , we just saw — " " THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE , I KNOW IT ! " Snape howled , pointing at Harry and Hermione . 
His face was twisted ; spit was flying from his mouth . 
" Calm down , man ! " Fudge barked . 
" You ' re talking nonsense ! " 
" Think about what you are saying . 
This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago . 
" Of course not ! " said Madam Pomfrey , bristling . 
" Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once , I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further . " 
" I'd watch out for him if I were you , Dumbledore . " " Oh , he's not unbalanced , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" He's just suffered a severe disappointment . " 
" He's not the only one ! " puffed Fudge . 
All it needs now is for the story of that Hippogriff's escape to get out , and I ' ll be a laughingstock ! 
Well … I'd better go and notify the Ministry … " " And the Dementors ? " said Dumbledore . " They ' ll be removed from the school , I trust ? " 
" Oh yes , they ' ll have to go , " said Fudge , running his fingers distractedly through his hair . 
As he and Fudge left the dormitory , Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again . 
Muttering angrily to herself , she headed back to her office . 
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward . 
Ron had woken up . 
They could see him sitting up , rubbing his head , looking around . 
" What — what happened ? " he groaned . 
" Harry ? 
Why are we in here ? 
Where's Sirius ? 
Where's Lupin ? 
What's going on ? " 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other . 
" You explain , " said Harry , helping himself to some more chocolate . 
When Harry , Ron , and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day , it was to find an almost deserted castle . 
The sweltering , heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit . 
Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going , however , so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds , still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now . 
Sitting near the lake , watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water , Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank . 
The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night … A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary - eyed Hagrid , mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth - sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them . 
" Beaky ! 
He escaped ! 
He's free ! 
" Blimey , haven ' yeh heard ? " said Hagrid , his smile fading a little . 
He lowered his voice , even though there was nobody in sight . 
" Er — Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin ' … Thought everyone'd know by now … Professor Lupin's a werewolf , see . 
" He's packing ? " said Harry , alarmed . 
" Why ? " " Leavin ' , isn ' he ? " said Hagrid , looking surprised that Harry had to ask . 
Harry scrambled to his feet . 
" I'm going to see him , " he said to Ron and Hermione . 
I still want to see him . 
I ' ll meet you back here . " 
Lupin's office door was open . 
He had already packed most of his things . 
The Grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase , which was open and nearly full . 
Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door . 
" I saw you coming , " said Lupin , smiling . 
He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over . 
It was the Marauder's Map . 
" I just saw Hagrid , " said Harry . 
" And he said you'd resigned . 
It's not true , is it ? " 
" I'm afraid it is , " said Lupin . 
He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents . 
" Why ? " said Harry . 
" The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping Sirius , do they ? " 
Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry . 
" No . 
Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives . " 
He sighed . 
I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard . 
So he — er — accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast . " 
" You ' re not leaving just because of that ! " said Harry . 
" This time tomorrow , the owls will start arriving from parents … They will not want a werewolf teaching their children , Harry . 
I could have bitten any of you … That must never happen again . " 
" You ' re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we ' ve ever had ! " said Harry . 
He carried on emptying his drawers . 
Then , while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay , Lupin said , " From what the headmaster told me this morning , you saved a lot of lives last night , Harry . 
If I'm proud of anything I ' ve done this year , it's how much you ' ve learned … Tell me about your Patronus . " 
" How d ' you know about that ? " said Harry , distracted . 
" What else could have driven the Dementors back ? " 
Harry told Lupin what had happened . 
When he'd finished , Lupin was smiling again . 
" Yes , your father was always a stag when he transformed , " he said . 
" You guessed right … that's why we called him Prongs . " 
Lupin threw his last few books into his case , closed the desk drawers , and turned to look at Harry . 
" Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night , " he said , handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak . 
" I am no longer your teacher , so I don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well . 
It's no use to me , and I daresay you , Ron , and Hermione will find uses for it . " 
Harry took the map and grinned . 
" I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle . " 
There was a knock on the door . 
Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket . 
It was Professor Dumbledore . 
He didn't look surprised to see Harry there . 
" Thank You , Headmaster . " 
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty Grindylow tank . 
" Well — good - bye , Harry , " he said , smiling . 
I feel sure we ' ll meet again sometime . 
Headmaster , there is no need to see me to the gates , I can manage … " Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible . 
" Good - bye , then , Remus , " said Dumbledore soberly . 
Lupin shifted the Grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands . 
Then , with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile , Lupin left the office . 
Harry sat down in his vacated chair , staring glumly at the floor . 
He heard the door close and looked up . 
Dumbledore was still there . 
" Why so miserable , Harry ? " he said quietly . 
" You should be very proud of yourself after last night . " 
" It didn't make any difference , " said Harry bitterly . 
You helped uncover the truth . 
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate . " 
Terrible . 
Something stirred in Harry's memory . 
Greater and more terrible than ever before … Professor Trelawney's prediction ! " Professor Dumbledore — yesterday , when I was having my Divination exam , Professor Trelawney went very — very strange . " 
" Indeed ? " said Dumbledore . " Er — stranger than usual , you mean ? " " Yes … her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said … she said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight … She said the servant would help him come back to power . " 
Harry stared up at Dumbledore . 
" And then she sort of became normal again , and she couldn't remember anything she'd said . 
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed . 
" Do you know , Harry , I think she might have been . " he said thoughtfully . 
" Who'd have thought it ? 
That brings her total of real predictions up to two . 
I should offer her a pay raise … " " But — " Harry looked at him , aghast . 
How could Dumbledore take this so calmly ? 
" But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew ! 
The consequences of our actions are always so complicated , so diverse , that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed … Professor Trelawney , bless her , is living proof of that … You did a very noble thing , in saving Pettigrew's life . " 
" But if he helps Voldemort back to power … " " Pettigrew owes his life to you . 
You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt … When one wizard saves another wizard's life , it creates a certain bond between them … and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter . " " I don't want a connection with Pettigrew ! " said Harry . 
" He betrayed my parents ! " 
But trust me … the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life . " 
Harry couldn't imagine when that would be . 
Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking . 
" I knew your father very well , both at Hogwarts and later , Harry , " he said gently . 
Harry looked up at him . 
Dumbledore wouldn't laugh — he could tell Dumbledore … " I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus . 
I mean , when I saw myself across the lake … I thought I was seeing him . " 
" An easy mistake to make , " said Dumbledore softly . 
" I expect you ' ll tire of hearing it , but you do look extraordinarily like James . 
Except for the eyes … you have your mother's eyes . " 
Harry shook his head . 
" It was stupid , thinking it was him , " he muttered . 
" I mean , I knew he was dead . " 
" You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us ? 
You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble ? 
Your father is alive in you , Harry , and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him . 
How else could you produce that particular Patronus ? 
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said . 
" Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi , " said Dumbledore , smiling . 
You know , Harry , in a way , you did see your father last night … You found him inside yourself . " 
And Dumbledore left the office , leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts . 
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius , Buckbeak , and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Professor Dumbledore . 
As the end of term approached , Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened , but none of them came close to the truth . 
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak . 
He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the Hippogriff to safety , and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper . 
Percy Weasley , meanwhile , had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape . 
" If I manage to get into the Ministry , I ' ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement ! " he told the only person who would listen — his girlfriend , Penelope . 
Though the weather was perfect , though the atmosphere was so cheerful , though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom , Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits . 
He certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go . 
The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation . 
" Maybe a vampire , " suggested Dean Thomas hopefully . 
He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now , whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet . 
But the thing that was lowering Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys . 
For maybe half an hour , a glorious half hour , he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on … his parents ' best friend … It would have been the next best thing to having his own father back . 
And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news , because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding , Harry couldn't help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had , and the fact that it was now impossible . 
The exam results came out on the last day of term . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had passed every subject . 
Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions . 
Harry wouldn't have thought it possible that Snape's dislike for him could increase , but it certainly had . 
A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape's thin mouth every time he looked at Harry , and he was constantly flexing his fingers , as though itching to place them around Harry's throat . 
Gryffindor House , meanwhile , largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup , had won the House championship for the third year running . 
This meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold , and that the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot , as everybody celebrated . 
Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as he ate , drank , talked , and laughed with the rest . 
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning , Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news . 
" I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning , just before breakfast . 
I ' ve decided to drop Muggle Studies . " 
" But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent ! " said Ron . " I know , " sighed Hermione , " but I can't stand another year like this one . 
I ' ve handed it in . 
Without Muggle Studies and Divination , I ' ll be able to have a normal schedule again . " 
" We're supposed to be your friends . " 
" I promised I wouldn't tell anyone , " said Hermione severely . 
She looked around at Harry , who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain . 
Two whole months before he'd see it again … " Oh , cheer up , Harry ! " said Hermione sadly . 
" I'm okay , " said Harry quickly . 
" Just thinking about the holidays . " 
I ' ll fix it up with Mum and Dad , then I ' ll call you . 
I know how to use a fellytone now — " " A telephone , Ron , " said Hermione . 
" Honestly , you should take Muggle Studies next year … " Ron ignored her . 
" It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer ! 
How about it , Harry ? 
Come and stay , and we ' ll go and see it ! 
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal . 
" Yeah … I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come … especially after what I did to Aunt Marge … " Feeling considerably more cheerful , Harry joined Ron and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap , and when the witch with the tea cart arrived , he bought himself a very large lunch , though nothing with chocolate in it . 
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up … " Harry , " said Hermione suddenly , peering over his shoulder . 
" What's that thing outside your window ? " 
Harry turned to look outside . 
Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass . 
He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl , carrying a letter that was much too big for it . 
The owl was so small , in fact , that it kept tumbling over in the air , buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream . 
Harry quickly pulled down the window , stretched out his arm , and caught it . 
It felt like a very fluffy Snitch . 
Crookshanks sat up in his seat , following the owl with his great yellow eyes . 
Ron , noticing this , snatched the owl safely out of harm's way . 
Harry picked up the letter . 
It was addressed to him . 
He ripped open the letter , and shouted , " It's from Sirius ! " " What ? " said Ron and Hermione excitedly . 
Buckbeak and I are in hiding . 
I won't tell you where , in case this owl falls into the wrong hands . 
I have some doubt about his reliability , but he is the best I could find , and he did seem eager for the job . 
I believe the Dementors are still searching for me , but they haven't a hope of finding me here . 
I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon , a long way from Hogwarts , so that the security on the castle will be lifted . 
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting . 
It was I who sent you the Firebolt — " Ha ! " said Hermione triumphantly . 
" See ! 
I told you it was from him ! " " Yes , but he hadn't jinxed it , had he ? " said Ron . " Ouch ! " 
The tiny owl now hooting happily in his hand , had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way . 
– Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me . 
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle's house . 
I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north , but I think the sight of me alarmed you . 
I am enclosing something else for you , which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable . 
If ever you need me , send word . 
I ' ll write again soon . 
Sirius Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope . 
There was another piece of parchment in there . 
He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he'd swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp . 
I , Sirius Black , Harry Potter's godfather , hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends . 
" That ' ll be good enough for Dumbledore ! " said Harry happily . 
He looked back at Sirius's letter . 
" Hang on , there's a PS … " I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl , as it's my fault he no longer has a rat . 
Ron's eyes widened . 
The minute owl was still hooting excitedly . 
" Keep him ? " he said uncertainly . 
He looked closely at the owl for a moment ; then , to Harry's and Hermione's great surprise , he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff . 
" What do you reckon ? " 
Ron asked the cat . 
" That's good enough for me , " said Ron happily . 
" He's mine . " 
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King's Cross station . 
It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he , Ron , and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three - quarters . 
Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once . 
He was standing a good distance from Mr . and Mrs . Weasley , eyeing them suspiciously , and when Mrs . Weasley hugged Harry in greeting , his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed . 
" I ' ll call about the World Cup ! " Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him and Hermione goodbye , then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig's cage toward Uncle Vernon , who greeted him in his usual fashion . 
" What's that ? " he snarled , staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand . 
" If it's another form for me to sign , you ' ve got another — " " It's not , " said Harry cheerfully . 
" It's a letter from my godfather . " 
" Godfather ? " sputtered Uncle Vernon . 
" You haven't got a godfather ! " 
" Yes , I have , " said Harry brightly . 
" He was my mum and dad's best friend . 
He's a convicted murderer , but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run . 
The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it " the Riddle House , " even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there . 
Once a fine - looking manor , and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around , the Riddle House was now damp , derelict , and unoccupied . 
The Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was " creepy . " 
Half a century ago , something strange and horrible had happened there , something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce . 
The story had been picked over so many times , and had been embroidered in so many places , that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore . 
Every version of the tale , however , started in the same place : Fifty years before , at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive , a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead . 
The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could . 
Cold as ice ! 
The police were summoned , and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill - disguised excitement . 
All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly , three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night . 
The Hanged Man , the village pub , did a roaring trade that night ; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders . 
They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles ' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested . 
" Frank ! " cried several people . 
" Never ! " Frank Bryce was the Riddles ' gardener . 
He lived alone in a run - down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House . 
Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises , and had been working for the Riddles ever since . 
I'm sure if I ' ve offered him a cuppa once , I ' ve offered it a hundred times . 
Never wanted to mix , he didn't . " 
" Ah , now , " said a woman at the bar , " he had a hard war , Frank . 
He likes the quiet life . 
That's no reason to -- " " Who else had a key to the back door , then ? " barked the cook . 
" There's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember ! 
Nobody forced the door last night ! 
No broken windows ! 
" Horrible temper , " said Dot , nodding fervently . 
" I remember , when he was a kid ... " By the following morning , hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles . 
But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton , in the dark and dingy police station , Frank was stubbornly repeating , again and again , that he was innocent , and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles'deaths had been a teenage boy , a stranger , dark - haired and pale . 
Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy , and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him . 
Then , just when things were looking very serious for Frank , the report on the Riddles ' bodies came back and changed everything . 
A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned , stabbed , shot , strangles , suffocated , or ( as far as they could tell ) harmed at all . 
In fact ( the report continued , in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment ) , the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead . 
The doctors did note ( as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies ) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said , whoever heard of three people being frightened to death ? 
As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all , the police were forced to let Frank go . 
The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard , and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while . 
To everyone's surprise , and amid a cloud of suspicion , Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House . 
" And if he had any decency , he'd leave here , knowing as how we knows he did it . " 
But Frank did not leave . 
He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House , and then the next -- for neither family stayed long . 
Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place , which , in the absence of inhabitants , started to fall into disrepair . 
The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening , however . 
Frank was nearing his seventy - seventh birthday now , very deaf , his bad leg stiffer than ever , but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather , even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him , try as he might to suppress them . 
Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House . 
They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth . 
Once or twice , they broke into the old house for a dare . 
They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession , and it amused them to see him limping across the garden , brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them . 
Frank , for his part , believed the boys tormented him because they , like their parents and grandparents , though him a murderer . 
So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house , he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him . 
He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot - water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee . 
Standing at the sink , filling the kettle , he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows . 
Frank knew at once what was going on . 
The boys had broken into the house again , and judging by the flickering quality of the light , they had started a fire . 
Frank had no telephone , in any case , he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles'deaths . 
He put down the kettle at once , hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow , and was soon back in his kitchen , fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door . 
He picked up his walking stick , which was propped against the wall , and set off into the night . 
The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced , nor did any of the windows . 
Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy , took out the old key , put it into the lock , and opened the door noiselessly . 
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen . 
Frank had not entered it for many years ; nevertheless , although it was very dark , he remembered where the door into the hall was , and he groped his way towards it , his nostrils full of the smell of decay , ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead . 
He reached the hall , which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door , and started to climb the stairs , blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone , because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick . 
On the landing , Frank turned right , and saw at once where the intruders were : At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar , and a flickering light shone through the gap , casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor . 
Frank edged closer and closer , he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond . 
The fire , he now saw , had been lit in the grate . 
" There is a little more in the bottle , My Lord , if you are still hungry . " 
" Later , " said a second voice . 
This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high - pitched , and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind . 
Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up . 
Frank turned his right ear toward the door , the better to hear . 
There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface , and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor . 
Frank caught a glimpse of a small man , his back to the door , pushing the chair into place . 
He was wearing a long black cloak , and there was a bald patch at the back of his head . 
Then he went out of sight again . 
" Where is Nagini ? " said the cold voice . 
" I -- I don't know , My Lord , " said the first voice nervously . 
" I will need feeding in the night . 
The journey has tired me greatly . " 
Brow furrowed , Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door , listening very hard . 
There was a pause , and then the man called Wormtail spoke again . 
" My Lord , may I ask how long we are going to stay here ? " 
" A week , " said the cold voice . 
The place is moderately comfortable , and the plan cannot proceed yet . 
It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over . " 
Owing , no doubt , to a buildup of earwax , he had heard the word " Quidditch , " which was not a word at all . 
( Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear . ) " Forgive me , but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over ? " " Because , fool , at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world , and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty , on the watch for signs of ususual activity , checking and double - checking identities . 
They will be obsessed with security , lest the Muggles notice anything . 
So we wait . " 
Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear . 
He had distinctly heard the words " Ministry of Magic , " " wizards , " and " Muggles . " 
Plainly , each of these expressions meant something secret , and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code : spies and criminals . 
Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more , and listened more closely still . 
Wormtail said quietly . 
" Certainly I am determined , Wormtail . " 
There was a note of menace in the cold voice now . 
" It could be done without Harry Potter , My Lord . " 
" I see ... " " My Lord , I do not say this out of concern for the boy ! " said Wormtail , his voice rising squeakily . 
" The boy is nothing to me , nothing at all ! 
If you allowed me to leave you for a short while -- you know that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person -- " " I could use another wizard , " said the cold voice softly , " that is true ... " " My Lord , it makes sense , " said Wormtail , sounding thoroughly relieved now . 
" Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult , he is so well protected -- " 
" And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute ? 
I wonder ... perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you , Wormtail ? 
I -- I have no wish to leave you , none at all -- " " Do not lie to me ! " hissed the second voice . 
You are regretting that you ever returned to me . 
I revolt you . 
I see you flinch when you look at me , feel you shudder when you touch me ... " " No ! 
My devotion to Your Lordship -- " " Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice . 
How am I to survive without you , when I need feeding every few hours ? 
" I am no stronger , and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care . 
For a few seconds , Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling . 
The the second man spoke once more , in a whisper that was almost a hiss . 
" I have my reasons for using the boy , as I have already explained to you , and I will use no other . 
I have waited thirteen years . 
A few more months will make no difference . 
As for the protection surrounding the boy , I believe my plan will be effective . 
All that is needed is a little courage from you , Wormtail -- courage you will find , unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort's wrath -- " " My Lord , I must speak ! " said Wormtail , panic in his voice now . 
" All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord , Bertha Jorkin's disappearance will not go unnoticed for long , and if we proceed , if I murder -- " " If ? " whispered the second voice . 
" If ? 
If you follow the plan , Wormtail , the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died . 
You will do it quietly and without fuss ; I only wish that i could do it myself , but in my present condition ... Come , Wormtail , one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear . 
I am not asking you to do it alone . 
" I was the one who found you . 
I brought you Bertha Jorkins . " 
" A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you , Wormtail -- though , if truth be told , you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her , were you ? " " I -- I thought she might be useful , My Lord -- " " Liar , " said the second voice again , the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever . 
" However , I do not deny that her information was invaluable . 
" Ah , Wormtail , you don't want me to spoil the surprise ? 
Your part will come at the very end ... but I promise you , you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins . " 
I killed Bertha because I had to . 
In any case , awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays . 
Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns ... " Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it , but it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh , cold as his speech . 
" We could have modified her memory ? 
Out in the corridor , Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat . 
The man with the cold voice had killed a woman . 
He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement . 
He was dangerous -- a madman . 
And he was planning more murders -- this boy , Harry Potter , whoever he was -- was in danger - Frank knew what he must do . 
Now , if ever , was the time to go to the police . 
He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village ... but the cold voice was speaking again , and Frank remained where he was , frozen to the spot , listening with all his might . 
" One more murder ... my faithful servant at Hogwarts ... Harry Potter is as good as mine , Wormtail . 
It is decided . 
There will be no more argument . 
But quiet ... I think I hear Nagini ... " 
And the second man's voice changed . 
Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure . 
And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway . 
He turned to look , and found himself paralyzed with fright . 
Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor , and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight , he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake , at least twelve feet long . 
Horrified , transfixed , Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide , curving track through the thick dust on the floor , coming closer and closer -- What was he to do ? 
The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder , yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him - But before he had made his decision , the snake was level with him , and then , incredibly , miraculously , it was passing ; it was following the spitting , hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door , and in seconds , the tip of its diamond - patterned tail had vanished through the gap . 
There was sweat on Frank's forehead now , and the hand on the walking stick was trembling . 
Inside the room , the cold voice was continuing to hiss , and Frank was visited by a strange idea , an impossible idea ... This man could talk to snakes . 
Frank didn't understand what was going on . 
He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot - water bottle . 
The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move . 
As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself , the cold voice switched abruptly to English again . 
" Nagini has interesting news , Wormtail , " it said . 
" Indeed , yes , " said the voice , " According to Nagini , there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room , listening to every word we say . " 
Frank didn't have a chance to hide himself . 
There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open . 
A short , balding man with graying hair , a pointed nose , and small , watery eyes stood before Frank , a mixture of fear and alarm in his face . 
Where are your manners ? " 
The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire , but Frank couldn't see the speaker . 
the snake , on the other hand , was curled up on the rotting hearth rug , like some horrible travesty of a pet dog . 
Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room . 
The fire was the only source of light in the room ; it cast long , spidery shadows upon the walls . 
Frank stared at the back of the armchair ; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant , for Frank couldn't even see the back of his head . 
" You heard everything , Muggle ? " said the cold voice . 
" What's that you ' re calling me ? " said Frank defiantly , for now that he was inside the room , now that the time had come for some sort of action , he felt braver ; it had always been so in the war . 
" I am calling you a Muggle , " said the voice coolly . 
" It means that you are not a wizard . " 
" All I know is I ' ve heard enough to interest the police tonight , I have . 
And I ' ll tell youthis too , " he added , on a sudden inspiration , " my wife knows I'm up here , and if I don't come back -- " " You have no wife , " said te cold voice , very quietly . 
" Nobody knows you are here . 
Do not lie to Lord Voldemort , Muggle , for he knows ... he always knows ... " " Is that right ? " said Frank roughly . 
" Lord , is it ? 
Turn ' round and face me like a man , why don't you ? " " But I am not a man , Muggle , " said the cold voice , barely audible now over the crackling of the flames . 
" I am much , much more than a man . 
However ... why not ? 
The servant gave a whimper . 
" You heard me , Wormtail . " 
Slowly , with his face screwed up , as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay , the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair . 
The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug . 
And then the chair was facing Frank , and he saw what was sitting in it . 
His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter . 
He opened his mouth and let out a scream . 
He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand . 
There was a flash of green light , a rushing sound , and Frank Bryce crumpled . 
He was dead before he hit the floor . 
Two hundred miles away , the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start . 
Harry lay flat on his back , breathing hard as though he had been running . 
He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face . 
The old scar on his forehead , which was shaped like a bolt of lightning , was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white - hot wire to his skin . 
He sat up , one hand still on his scar , the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses , which were on the bedside table . 
He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus , lit by a faint , misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window . 
Harry ran his fingers over the scar again . 
It was still painful . 
He turned on the lamp beside him , scrambled out of bed , crossed the room , opened his wardrobe , and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door . 
A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him , his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair . 
harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken . 
The dim picture of a darkened room came to him ... There had been a snake on a hearth rug ... a small man called Peter , nicknamed Wormtail ... and a cold , high voice ... the voice of Lord Voldemort . 
Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought ... 
He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like , but it was impossible ... All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort's chair had swung around , and he , Harry , had seen what was sitting in it , he had felt a spasm of horror , which had awoken him ... or had that been the pain in his scar ? 
And who had the old man been ? 
For there had definitely been an old man ; Harry had watched him fall to the ground . 
It was all becoming confused . 
Harry put his face into his hands , blocking out his bedroom , trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room , but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands ; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them ... Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed , though Harry could not remember the name ... and they had been plotting to kill someone else ... him ! 
Harry took his face out of his hands , opened his eyes , and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there . 
As it happened , there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room . 
Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large , empty cage in which his snowy owl , Hedwig , usually perched . 
Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks , throwing a red ball to one another . 
Harry walked over to the book , picked it up , and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty - foot - high hoop . 
Then he snapped the book shut . 
Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion , the best sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the moment . 
He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table , crossed to the window , and drew back the curtains to survey the street below . 
Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning . 
All the curtains were closed . 
As far as Harry could see through the darkness , there wasn't a living creature in sight , not even a cat . 
And yet ... and yet ... Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it , running a finger over his scar again . 
It wasn't the pain that bothered him ; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury . 
He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night . 
Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick . 
No , the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him , it had been because Voldemort had been close by ... But Voldemort couldn't be here , now ... The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd , impossible ... Harry listened closely to the silence around him . 
Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak ? 
And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room . 
There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley , and they were plainly still asleep , their dreams untroubled and painless . 
Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best ; it wasn't as though they were ever any help to him awake . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were Harry's only living relatives . 
They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form , which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot . 
They had explained away Harry's long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St . Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys . 
Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world . 
And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place . 
If it hadn't been for Voldemort , Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead . 
If it hadn't been for Voldemort , Harry would still have had parents ... Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark wizard for a century , a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother . 
Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry ; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full - grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and , incredibly , it had not worked . 
Instead of killing the small boy , the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort . 
His powers gone , his life almost extinguished , Voldemort had fled ; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted , Voldemort's followers had disbanded , and Harry Potter had become famous . 
It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover , on his eleventh birthday , that he was a wizard ; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name . 
Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went . 
But he was used to it now : At the end of this summer , he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts , and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again . 
But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school . 
He looked hopelessly around his room again , and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July . 
At once , Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head , shrill and panicky . 
" Your scar hurt ? 
Harry , that's really serious .... Write to Professor Dumbledore ! 
Yes , that would be Hermione's advice : Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts , and in the meantime , consult a book . 
Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue - black sky . 
As far as he knew , he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's ; it was highly unlikely , therefore , that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions . 
As for informing the headmaster , Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays . 
He amused himself for a moment , picturing Dumbledore , with his long silver beard , full length wizard's robes , and pointed hat , stretched out on a beach somewhere , rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose . 
Wherever Dumbledore was , though , Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him ; Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone , even without an address . 
But what would he write ? 
Dear Professor Dumbledore , Sorry to bother you , but my scar hurt this morning . 
Yours sincerely , Harry Potter . 
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend , Ron Weasley's , reaction , and in a moment , Ron's red hair and long - nosed , freckled face seemed to swim before Harry , wearing a bemused expression . 
" Your scar hurt ? 
I mean ... you'd know , wouldn't you ? 
He'd be trying to do you in again , wouldn't be ? 
I dunno , Harry , maybe curse scars always twinge a bit ... I ' ll ask Dad . . . 
Mr . Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic , but he didn't have any particular expertise in the matter of curses , as far as Harry knew . 
In any case , Harry didn't like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he , Harry , was getting jumpy about a few moments ' pain . 
Mrs . Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione , and Fred and George , Ron's sixteen - year - old twin brothers , might think Harry was losing his nerve . 
The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world ; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ( Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup ) , and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar . 
Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles . 
What he really wanted ( and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself ) was someone like - someone like a parent : an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid , someone who cared about him , who had had experience with Dark Magic .... 
And then the solution came to him . 
It was so simple , and so obvious , that he couldn't believe it had taken so long - Sirius . 
Harry leapt up from the bed , hurried across the room , and sat down at his desk ; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him , loaded his eagle - feather quill with ink , wrote Dear Sirius , then paused , wondering how best to phrase his problem , still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away . 
But then , perhaps it wasn't so surprising - after all , he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago . 
For one glorious hour , Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last , because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared . 
Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak , and since then , Sirius had been on the run . 
It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him . 
The Dursleys had never allowed this before ; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible , coupled with their fear of his powers , had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this . 
But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather - for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent . 
Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive . 
Somehow , Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight , perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South . 
Sirius's letters , which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry's bed , sounded chearful , and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to . 
Well , he needed to right now , all right ... Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room . 
Finally , when the sun had risen , when his bedroom walls had turned gold , and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room , Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter . 
Dear Sirius , Thanks for your last letter . 
That bird was enormous ; it could hardly get through my window . 
A weird thing happened this morning , though . 
My scar hurt again . 
Last time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts . 
But I don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now , can he ? 
Say hello to Buckbeak for me . 
Harry Yes , thought Harry , that looked all right . 
There was no point putting in the dream ; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried . 
He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk , ready for when Hedwig returned . 
Then he got to his feet , stretched , and opened his wardrobe once more . 
By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen , the three Dursleys were already seated around the table . 
None of them looked up as he entered or sat down . 
Uncle Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily Mail , and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters , her lips pursed over her horselike teeth . 
When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley's plate with a tremulous " There you are , Diddy darling , " Dudley glowered at her . 
His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end - of - year report . 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual : Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn't understand him , while Uncle Vernon maintained that " he didn't want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway . " 
However , at the bottom of the report there were a few well - chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away . 
No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big - boned , and that his poundage was really puppy fat , and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food , the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore . 
The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia's eyes - so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls , and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see : that far from needing extra nourishment , Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale . 
So - after many tantrums , after arguments that shook Harry's bedroom floor , and many tears from Aunt Petunia - the new regime had begun . 
The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge , which had been emptied of all Dudley's favorite things - fizzy drinks and cakes , chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called " rabbit food . " 
She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry . 
He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's . 
Aunt Petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up Dudley's morale was to make sure that he did , at least , get more to eat than Harry . 
But Aunt Petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs . 
She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all . 
The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks , Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help , and they had risen to the occasion magnificently . 
Hedwig had returned from Hermione's house with a large box stuffed full of sugar - free snacks . 
Poor Errol , who was elderly and feeble , had needed a full five days to recover from the journey . 
And then on Harry's birthday ( which the Dursleys had completely ignored ) he had received four superb birthday cakes , one each from Ron , Hermione , Hagrid , and Sirius . 
Harry still had two of them left , and so , looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs , he ate his grapefruit without complaint . 
Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter . 
" Is this it ? " 
he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia . 
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look , and then nodded pointedly at Dudley , who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry's with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes . 
Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh , which ruffled his large , bushy mustache , and picked up his spoon . 
The doorbell rang . 
Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall . 
Quick as a flash , while his mother was occupied with the kettle , Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon's grapefruit . 
Harry heard talking at the door , and someone laughing , and Uncle Vernon answering curtly . 
Then the front door closed , and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall . 
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to . 
She didn't have to wait long to find out ; after about a minute , he was back . 
He looked livid . 
" In the living room . 
Now . " Bewildered , wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time , Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room . 
Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them . 
" So , " he said , marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest . 
" So . " 
" This just arrived , " said Uncle Vernon . 
" A letter . 
About you . " 
Harry's confusion increased . 
Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him ? 
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry , then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud : Dear Mr . and Mrs . Dursley , We have never been introduced , but I am sure you have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron . 
As Harry might have told you , the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night , and my husband , Arthur , has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports . 
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match , as this really is a once - in - alifetime opportunity ; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years , and tickets are extremely hard to come by . 
We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays , and to see him safely onto the train back to school . 
It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way , because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house , and I am not sure he even knows where it is . 
I do hope we ' ve put enough stamps on . 
Uncle Vernon finished reading , put his hand back into his breast pocket , and drew out something else . 
" Look at this , " he growled . 
He held up the envelope in which Mrs . Weasley's letter had come , and Harry had to fight down a laugh . 
Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front , into which Mrs . Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys ' address in minute writing . 
His uncle's eyes flashed . 
" The postman noticed , " he said through gritted teeth . 
" Very interested to know where this letter came from , he was . 
That's why he rang the doorbell . 
Seemed to think it was funny . " 
Harry didn't say anything . 
Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps , but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary . 
Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected ( however distantly ) with people like Mrs . Weasley . 
Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry , who tried to keep his expression neutral . 
If he didn't do or say anything stupid , he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime . 
He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something , but he merely continued to glare . 
Harry decided to break the silence . 
" So - can I go then ? " he asked . 
A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon's large purple face . 
Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache : a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon's most fundamental instincts came into conflict . 
Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy , something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years . 
On the other hand , allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys ' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped , and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house . 
To give himself thinking time , it seemed , he looked down at Mrs . Weasley's letter again . 
" Who is this woman ? " he said , staring at the signature with distaste . 
" You ' ve seen her , " said Harry . 
" She's my friend Ron's mother , she was meeting him off the Hog - off the school train at the end of last term . " 
Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry's school aloud in the Dursley household . 
Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant . 
" Load of children with red hair ? " 
Harry frowned . 
He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone " dumpy , " when his own son , Dudley , had finally achieved what he'd been threatening to do since the age of three , and become wider than he was tall . 
Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again . 
" Quidditch - what is this rubbish ? " 
Harry felt a second stab of annoyance . 
" It's a sport , " he said shortly . 
" Played on broom - " " All right , all right ! " said Uncle Vernon loudly . 
Apparently his nerves couldn't stand the sound of the word " broomsticks " in his living room . 
He took refuge in perusing the letter again . 
Harry saw his lips form the words " send us your answer ... in the normal way . " 
He scowled . 
" What does she mean , ' the normal way ' ? " he spat . 
That's what's normal for wizards . " 
Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword . 
Shaking with anger , he shot a nervous look through the window , as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass . 
" How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof ? " he hissed , his face now a rich plum color . 
" You stand there , in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back - " " Only after Dudley finished with them , " said Harry coldly , and indeed , he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands , and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans . 
Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys'stupid rules . 
He wasn't following Dudley's diet , and he wasn't going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup , not if he could help it . 
Harry took a deep , steadying breath and then said , " Okay , I can't see the World Cup . 
Can I go now , then ? 
Only I ' ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish . 
You know - my godfather . " 
Now he watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon's face , making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream . 
" You ' re - you ' re writing to him , are you ? " said Uncle Vernon , in a would - be calm voice - but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear . 
" Well - yeah , " said Harry , casually . 
He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words . 
He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon's thick , dark , neatly parted hair . 
If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius , Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated . 
If he told Harry he couldn't go to the Quidditch World Cup , Harry would write and tell 
Sirius , who would know Harry was being mistreated . 
There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do . 
Harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle's mind as though the great mustached face were transparent . 
Harry tried not to smile , to keep his own face as blank as possible . 
And then " Well , all right then . 
You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing . 
I haven't got time to go dropping you off all over the country . 
And you can spend the rest of the summer there . 
And you can tell your - your godfather ... tell him ... tell him you ' re going . " 
" Okay then , " said Harry brightly . 
He turned and walked toward the living room door , fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop . 
He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys ' , he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup ! Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley , who had been lurking behind the door , clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off . 
He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry's face . 
" I feel really full , don't you ? " Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley's face , Harry took the stairs three at a time , and hurled himself back into his bedroom . 
The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back . 
She was sitting in her cage , staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes , and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something . 
" OUCH ! " said Harry as what appeared to be a small , gray , feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head . 
Harry massaged the spot furiously , looking up to see what had hit him , and saw a minute owl , small enough to fit into the palm of his hand , whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework . 
Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet . 
Harry bent down , recognized Ron's handwriting , then tore open the envelope . 
Harry - DAD GOT THE TICKETS - Ireland versus Bulgaria , Monday night . 
Mum's writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay . 
They might already have the letter , I don't know how fast Muggle post is . 
Thought I'd send this with Pig anyway . 
Harry stared at the word " Pig , " then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling . 
He had never seen anything that looked less like a pig . 
He went back to the letter : 
We're coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not , you can't miss the World Cup , only Mum and Dad reckon it's better if we pretend to ask their permission first . 
If they say yes , send Pig back with your answer pronto , and we ' ll come and get you at five o ' clock on Sunday . 
If they say no , send Pig back pronto and we ' ll come and get you at five o ' clock on Sunday anyway . 
Hermione's arriving this afternoon . 
Percy's started work - the Department of International Magical Cooperation . 
Don't mention anything about Abroad while you ' re here unless you want the pants bored off you . 
See you soon - Ron " Calm down ! " 
Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head , twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person . 
" Come here , I need you to take my answer back ! " 
The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig's cage . 
Hedwig looked coldly up at it , as though daring it to try and come any closer . 
Harry seized his eagle - feather quill once more , grabbed a fresh piece of parchment , and wrote : Ron , it's all okay , the Muggles say I can come . 
See you five o ' clock tomorrow . 
The moment the note was secure , the owl was off again ; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight . 
Harry turned to Hedwig . 
" Feeling up to a long journey ? " he asked her . 
Hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way . 
" Can you take this to Sirius for me ? " he said , picking up his letter . 
He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript . 
If you want to contact me , I ' ll be at my friend Ron Weasley's for the rest of the summer . 
His dad's got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup ! 
The letter finished , he tied it to Hedwig's leg ; she kept unusually still , as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave . 
" I ' ll be at Ron's when you get back , all right ? " 
Harry told her . 
Harry watched her out of sight , then crawled under his bed , wrenched up the loose floorboard , and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake . 
He sat there on the floor eating it , savoring the happiness that was flooding through him . 
He had cake , and Dudley had nothing but grapefruit ; it was a bright summer's day , he would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow , his scar felt perfectly normal again , and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup . 
It was hard , just now , to feel worried about anything - even Lord Voldemort . 
By twelve o ' clock the next day , Harry's school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions - the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father , the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius , the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year . 
He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food , double - checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills , and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first , on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts . 
The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable . 
" I hope you told them to dress properly , these people , " he snarled at once . 
" I ' ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear . 
Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding . 
Harry wasn't bothered about what the neighbors would think , but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards . 
Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit . 
To some people , this might have looked like a gesture of welcome , but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating . 
Dudley , on the other hand , looked somehow diminished . 
This was not because the diet was at last taking effect , but due to fright . 
Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers , and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London . 
It wasn't altogether surprising , therefore , that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside , and walking sideways from room to room , so as not to present the same target to the enemy . 
Lunch was an almost silent meal . 
Aunt Petunia wasn't , eating anything at all . 
Her arms were folded , her lips were pursed , and she seemed to be chewing her tongue , as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry . 
" They ' ll be driving , of course ? " 
Uncle Vernon barked across the table . 
" Er , " said Harry . 
He hadn't thought of that . 
How were the Weasleys going to pick him up ? 
They didn't have a car anymore ; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts . 
But Mr . Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year ; possibly he would do the same today ? 
" I think so , " said Harry . 
Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache . 
Normally , Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr . Weasley drove ; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were . 
But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr . Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari . 
Finally , at a quarter to five , Harry went back downstairs and into the living room . 
Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions . 
Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper , but his tiny eyes were not moving , and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car . 
Harry couldn't take the tension ; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall , his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves . 
But five o ' clock came and then went . 
Uncle Vernon , perspiring slightly in his suit , opened the front door , peered up and down the street , then withdrew his head quickly . 
I know , " said Harry . 
" Maybe - er - the traffic's bad , or something . " 
Ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was starting to feel anxious himself now . 
At half past , he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room . 
" Maybe they think they ' ll get invited to dinner if they ' re late . " 
" Well , they most certainly won't be , " said Uncle Vernon , and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room . 
That's if they ' re coming at all . 
Probably mistaken the day . 
Either that or they drive some tin - pot car that's broken d - AAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! " 
Harry jumped up . 
From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling , panic - stricken , across the room . 
" What happened ? " said Harry . 
" What's the matter ? " 
But Dudley didn't seem able to speak . 
Hands still clamped over his buttocks , he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen . 
Harry hurried into the living room . 
" What is it ? " 
gasped Aunt Petunia , who had backed into the wall and was staring , terrified , toward the fire . 
" What is it , Vernon ? " 
" Ouch ! 
Fred , no - go back , go back , there's been some kind of mistake - tell George not to - OUCH ! George , no , there's no room , go back quickly and tell Ron " " Maybe Harry can hear us , Dad - maybe he ' ll be able to let us out - " There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire . 
" Harry ? 
Harry , can you hear us ? " 
" What is this ? " growled Uncle Vernon . 
" What's going on ? " " They - they ' ve tried to get here by Floo powder , " said Harry , fighting a mad desire to laugh . 
" They can travel by fire - only you ' ve blocked the fireplace - hang on - " He approached the fireplace and called through the boards . 
" Mr . 
Weasley ? 
Can you hear me ? " 
The hammering stopped . 
Somebody inside the chimney piece said , " Shh ! " 
" Mr . 
" Damn ! " said Mr . Weasley's voice . 
" Really ? " said Mr . Weasley's voice excitedly . 
" Eclectic , you say ? 
Ron's voice now joined the others ' . 
" What are we doing here ? 
" No , this is exactly where we wanted to end up . " 
" Yeah , we ' re having the time of our lives here , " said George , whose voice sounded muffled , as though he was squashed against the wall . 
. " said Mr . Weasley vaguely . 
" I'm trying to think what to do .... Yes ... only way . . . 
Stand back , Harry . " 
Harry retreated to the sofa . 
Uncle Vernon , however , moved forward . 
" Wait a moment ! " he bellowed at the fire . 
" What exactly are you going to - " BANG . 
The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded - up fireplace burst outward , expelling Mr . Weasley , Fred , George , and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings . 
Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table ; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor , and gaped , speechless , at the Weasleys , all of whom had bright red hair , including Fred and George , who were identical to the last freckle . 
" That's better , " panted Mr . Weasley , brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses . 
" Ah - you must be Harry's aunt and uncle ! " Tall , thin , and balding , he moved toward Uncle Vernon , his hand outstretched , but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces , dragging Aunt Petunia . 
Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon . 
" Er - yes - sorry about that , " said Mr . Weasley , lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace . 
" It's all my fault . 
I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network , you see - just for an afternoon , you know , so we could get Harry . 
I ' ll light a fire to send the boys back , and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate . " 
They were still gaping at Mr . Weasley , thunderstruck . 
Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon . 
" Hello , Harry ! " said Mr . Weasley brightly . 
" We ' ll get it , " said Fred at once . 
Winking at Harry , he and George left the room . 
They knew where Harry's bedroom was , having once rescued him from it in the dead of night . 
Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley ; they had heard a lot about him from Harry . 
" Well , " said Mr . Weasley , swinging his arms slightly , while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence . 
As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick , this remark didn't go down too well with the Dursleys . 
Uncle Vernon's face purpled once more , and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again . 
Mr . Weasley was looking around . 
Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder . 
" Ah yes , I can see the plugs . 
I collect plugs , " he added to Uncle Vernon . 
" And batteries . 
Got a very large collection of batteries . 
My wife thinks I'm mad , but there you are . " 
Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr . Weasley was mad too . 
He moved ever so slightly to the right , screening Aunt Petunia from view , as though he thought Mr . Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack . 
Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room . 
Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs , and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen . 
" Ah , this is your cousin , is it , Harry ? " said Mr . Weasley , taking another brave stab at making conversation . 
" Yep , " said Harry , " that's Dudley . " 
He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other ; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming . 
Mr . Weasley , however , seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior . 
Indeed , from the tone of his voice when he next spoke , Harry was quite sure that Mr . Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was , except that Mr . Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear . 
Dudley whimpered . 
Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside . 
Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry's school trunk . 
" Ah , right , " said Mr . Weasley . 
He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand . 
Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one . 
" Incendio ! " said Mr . Weasley , pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him . 
Flames rose at once in the fireplace , crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours . 
Mr . Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket , untied it , took a pinch of the powder inside , and threw it onto the flames , which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever . 
" Off you go then , Fred , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Coming , " said Fred . " Oh no - hang on - " A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction - big , fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers . 
Fred scrambled around , cramming them back into his pocket , then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave , stepped forward , and walked right into the fire , saying " the Burrow ! " Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp . 
" Right then , George , " said Mr . Weasley , " you and the trunk . " 
Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better . 
Then , with a second whoosh , George had cried " the Burrow ! " and vanished too . 
" Ron , you next , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" See you , " said Ron brightly to the Dursleys . 
He grinned broadly at Harry , then stepped into the fire , shouted " the Burrow ! " and disappeared . 
Now Harry and Mr . Weasley alone remained . 
" Well . . . 
' bye then , " Harry said to the Dursleys . 
Harry moved toward the fire , but just as he reached the edge of the hearth , Mr . Weasley put out a hand and held him back . 
He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement . 
" Harry said good - bye to you , " he said . 
" It doesn't matter , " Harry muttered to Mr . Weasley . 
Mr . Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry's shoulder . 
" Surely you ' re going to say good - bye ? " 
Uncle Vernon's face worked furiously . 
But Mr . Weasley's wand was still in his hand , and Uncle Vernon's tiny eyes darted to it once , before he said , very resentfully , " Good - bye , then . " 
Harry wheeled around . 
Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents . 
He was kneeling beside the coffee table , and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot - long , purple , slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth . 
One bewildered second later , Harry realized that the foot - long thing was Dudley's tongue - and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him . 
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley , seized the end of his swollen tongue , and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth ; unsurprisingly , Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever , trying to fight her off . 
Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around , and Mr . Weasley had to shout to make himself heard . 
" No , really ! " said Mr . Weasley desperately . 
" It's a simple process it was the toffee - my son Fred - real practical joker - but it's only an Engorgement Charm - at least , I think it is - please , I can correct it - " But far from being reassured , the Dursleys became more panic - stricken ; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically , tugging Dudley's tongue as though determined to rip it out ; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue ; and Uncle Vernon , who had lost control completely , seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr . Weasley , who ducked , causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace . 
" Now really ! " said Mr . Weasley angrily , brandishing his wand . 
" I'm trying to help ! " Bellowing like a wounded hippo , Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament . 
" Harry , go ! 
Just go ! " 
Mr . Weasley shouted , his wand on Uncle Vernon . 
Harry didn't want to miss the fun , but Uncle Vernon's second ornament narrowly missed his left ear , and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr . Weasley . 
He stepped into the fire , looking over his shoulder as he said " the Burrow ! " His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr . Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon's hand with his wand , Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley , and Dudley's tongue lolling around like a great slimy python . 
But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast , and the Dursleys ' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald - green flames . 
Harry spun faster and faster , elbows tucked tightly to his sides , blurred fireplaces flashing past him , until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes . 
" Did he eat it ? " said Fred excitedly , holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee " Yeah , " said Harry , straightening up . 
" What was it ? " 
" Ton - Tongue Toffee , " said Fred brightly . 
The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter ; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red - haired people Harry had never seen before , though he knew immediately who they must be : Bill and Charlie , the two eldest Weasley brothers . 
" How ' re you doing , Harry ? " said the nearer of the two , grinning at him and holding out a large hand , which Harry shook , feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers . 
Charlie was built like the twins , shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron , who were both long and lanky . 
He had a broad , good - natured face , which was weather - beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned ; his arms were muscular , and one of them had a large , shiny burn on it . 
Bill got to his feet , smiling , and also shook Harry's hand . 
Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank , Gringotts , and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts ; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy : fussy about rule - breaking and fond of bossing everyone around . 
He was tall , with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail . 
Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert , except that Harry recognized his boots to be made , not of leather , but of dragon hide . 
I just dropped it .... 
It was his fault he went and ate it , I never told him to . " 
" You dropped it on purpose ! " roared Mr . Weasley . 
Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again . 
Mr . Weasley shouted . 
" Isn't he , Harry ? " " Yeah , he is , Mr . Weasley , " said Harry earnestly . 
" That's not the point ! " raged Mr . Weasley . 
Mrs . Weasley had just entered the kitchen . 
She was a short , plump woman with a very kind face , though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion . 
Then her eyes snapped back to her husband . 
" Tell me what , Arthur ? " 
Mr . Weasley hesitated . 
Harry could tell that , however angry he was with Fred and George , he hadn't really intended to tell Mrs . Weasley what had happened . 
There was a silence , while Mr . Weasley eyed his wife nervously . 
Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs . Weasley . 
One , with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth , was Harry's and Ron's friend , Hermione Granger . 
The other , who was small and red - haired , was Ron's younger sister , Ginny . 
Both of them smiled at Harry , who grinned back , which made Ginny go scarlet - she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow . 
" Tell me what , Arthur ? " 
Mrs . Weasley repeated , in a dangerous sort of voice . 
" He knows where he's sleeping , " said Ron , " in my room , he slept there last - " " We can all go , " said Hermione pointedly . 
" Oh , " said Ron , cottoning on . 
" Right . " 
" Yeah , we ' ll come too , " said George . 
" You stay where you are ! " snarled Mrs . Weasley . 
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen , and they , Hermione , and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories . 
Harry asked as they climbed . 
Ron and Ginny both laughed , although Hermione didn't . 
Joke stuff , you know . 
" We thought they just liked the noise . " 
" Only , most of the stuff - well , all of it , really - was a bit dangerous , " said Ron , " and , you know , they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money , and Mum went mad at them . 
O . W . L . s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels , the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen . 
Just then a door on the second landing opened , and a face poked out wearing hornrimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression . 
" Hi , Percy , " said Harry . 
" Oh hello , Harry , " said Percy . 
" I was wondering who was making all the noise . 
I'm trying to work in here , you know I ' ve got a report to finish for the office - and it's rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs . " 
" We're not thundering , " said Ron irritably . 
" We're walking . 
Sorry if we ' ve disturbed the top - secret workings of the Ministry of Magic . " 
" What are you working on ? " said Harry . 
" A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation , " said Percy smugly . 
Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year - " " That ' ll change the world , that report will , " said Ron . " Front page of the Daily Prophet , I expect , cauldron leaks . " 
Percy went slightly pink . 
Percy slammed his bedroom door shut . 
As Harry , Hermione , and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs , shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them . 
It sounded as though Mr . Weasley had told Mrs . Weasley about the toffees . 
The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay : the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch team , the Chudley Cannons , were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling , and the fish tank on the windowsill , which had previously held frog spawn , now contained one extremely large frog . 
Ron's old rat , Scabbers , was here no more , but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to Harry in Privet Drive . 
It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly . 
" Fred and George are in here with us , because Bill and Charlie are in their room , " he told Harry . 
" Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work . " 
" Er - why are you calling that owl Pig ? " Harry asked Ron . 
" Yeah , and that's not a stupid name at all , " said Ron sarcastically . 
" Ginny named him , " he explained to Harry . 
" She reckons it's sweet . 
And I tried to change it , but it was too late , he won't answer to anything else . 
He annoys me too , come to that . 
Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously . 
" Where's Crookshanks ? " 
Harry asked Hermione now . 
" Out in the garden , I expect , " she said . 
" He likes chasing gnomes . 
He's never seen any before . " 
" Percy's enjoying work , then ? " said Harry , sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling . 
" Enjoying it ? " said Ron darkly . 
He's obsessed . 
Just don't get him onto the subject of his boss . 
According to Mr . Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr . Crouch ... Mr . Crouch is of the opinion ... Mr . Crouch was telling me ... They ' ll be announcing their engagement any day now . " 
" Have you had a good summer , Harry ? " said Hermione . 
" They saved my life , those cakes . 
Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius . 
Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry's godfather as he was . 
" I think they ' ve stopped arguing , " said Hermione , to cover the awkward moment , because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry . 
The four of them left Ron's room and went back downstairs to find Mrs . 
Weasley alone in the kitchen , looking extremely badtempered . 
" We're eating out in the garden , " she said when they came in . 
" There's just not room for eleven people in here . 
Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables . 
Knives and forks , please , you two , " she said to Ron and Harry , pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink , which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling . 
" Oh for heaven's sake , " she snapped , now directing her wand at a dustpan , which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor , scooping up the potatoes . 
" Those two ! " she burst out savagely , now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard , and Harry knew she meant Fred and George . 
I don't know what's going to happen to them , I really don't . 
No ambition , unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can .... " Mrs . Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it . 
A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred . 
If they carry on the way they ' re going , they ' ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office . " 
Mrs . Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer , which shot open . 
Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it , flew across the kitchen , and began chopping the potatoes , which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan . 
" I don't know where we went wrong with them , " said Mrs . Weasley , putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans . 
She had picked up her wand from the table , and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse . 
" How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around ? " 
She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking . 
" C ' mon , " Ron said hurriedly to Harry , seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer , " let's go and help Bill and Charlie . " 
They left Mrs . Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard . 
They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy - legged ginger cat , Crookshanks , came pelting out of the garden , bottle - brush tail held high in the air , chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs . 
Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome . 
Barely ten inches high , its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door . 
Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot , trying to reach it . 
Meanwhile , a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house . 
The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden , and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out , and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn , smashing into each other , each attempting to knock the other's out of the air . 
Fred and George were cheering , Ginny was laughing , and Hermione was hovering near the hedge , apparently torn between amusement and anxiety . 
Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off . 
There was a clatter from overhead , and they all looked up to see Percy's head poking out of a window on the second floor . 
" Sorry , Perce , " said Bill , grinning . 
" Very badly , " said Percy peevishly , and he slammed the window shut . 
Chuckling , Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass , end to end , and then , with a flick of his wand , Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere . 
By seven o ' clock , the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs . Weasley's excellent cooking , and the nine Weasleys , Harry , and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear , deep - blue sky . 
At the far end of the table , Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms . 
" I ' ve told Mr . Crouch that I ' ll have it ready by Tuesday , " Percy was saying pompously . 
I think he ' ll be grateful I ' ve done it in good time , I mean , its extremely busy in our department just now , what with all the arrangements for the World Cup . 
We're just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports . 
Ludo Bagman - " " I like Ludo , " said Mr . Weasley mildly . 
" He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup . 
I did him a bit of a favor : His brother , Otto , got into a spot of trouble - a lawnmower with unnatural powers - I smoothed the whole thing over . " 
" Oh Bagman's likable enough , of course , " said Percy dismissively , " but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr . Crouch ! 
You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now ? 
. " " Oh Bertha's hopeless , all right , " said Percy . 
" I hear she's been shunted from department to department for years , much more trouble than she's worth ... but all the same , Bagman ought to be trying to find her . 
Mr . Crouch has been taking a personal interest , she worked in our department at one time , you know , and I think Mr . Crouch was quite fond of her - but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania . 
However " - Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine " we ' ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too . 
As you know , we ' ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup . " Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where Harry , Ron , and Hermione were sitting . 
" You know the one I'm talking about , Father . " 
He raised his voice slightly . 
Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione , " He's been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work . 
In the middle of the table , Mrs . Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring , which seemed to be a recent acquisition . 
Really , Bill , what do they say at the bank ? " " Mum , . no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure , " said Bill patiently . 
" And your hair's getting silly , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley , fingering her wand lovingly . " 
" You ' re so old - fashioned , Mum . 
Anyway , it's nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore's .... " Next to Mrs . Weasley , Fred , George , and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup . 
" They flattened Peru in the semifinals . " 
" Went down to Transylvania , three hundred and ninety to ten , " said Charlie gloomily . 
And Wales lost to Uganda , and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg . " 
Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world , a Firebolt . 
Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world , and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team . 
Mr . Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream , and by the time they had finished , moths were fluttering low over the table , and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle . 
Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes , laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks . 
Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking , then he said very quietly to Harry , " So - have you heard from Sirius lately ? " 
Hermione looked around , listening closely . 
" Yeah , " said Harry softly , " twice . 
He sounds okay . 
I wrote to him yesterday . 
He might write back while I'm here . " 
He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius , and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again , and about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn't want to worry them just now , not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful . 
" Look at the time , " Mrs . Weasley said suddenly , checking her wristwatch . 
" You really should be in bed , the whole lot of you you ' ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup . 
Harry , if you leave your school list out , I ' ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley . 
I'm getting everyone else's . 
" Wow - hope it does this time ! " said Harry enthusiastically . 
" Well , I certainly don't , " said Percy sanctimoniously . 
" Yeah , someone might slip dragon dung in it again , eh , Perce ? " said Fred . " That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway ! " said Percy , going very red in the face . 
" It was nothing personal ! " 
" It was , " Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table . 
" We sent it . " 
Harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in Ron's room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs . Weasley . 
" Time to go , Harry , dear , " she whispered , moving away to wake Ron . 
Harry felt around for his glasses , put them on , and sat up . 
It was still dark outside . 
At the foot of Harry's mattress he saw two large , disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets . 
" ' S ' time already ? " said Fred groggily . 
They dressed in silence , too sleepy to talk , then , yawning and stretching , the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen . 
Mrs . Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove , while Mr . Weasley was sitting at the table , checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets . 
He looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly . 
He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans , slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt . 
" We're supposed to go incognito - do I look like a Muggle , Harry ? " " Yeah , " said Harry , smiling , " very good . " 
" Where ' re Bill and Charlie and Per - Per - Percy ? " said George , failing to stifle a huge yawn . 
" Well , they ' re Apparating , aren't they ? " said Mrs . Weasley , heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls . 
" So they can have a bit of a lie - in . " 
Harry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another , but had never known any Hogwarts student to do it , and understood that it was very difficult . 
She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs . 
" You have to pass a test to Apparate ? " 
Harry asked . 
" Oh yes , " said Mr . Weasley , tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans . 
" The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license . 
It's not easy , Apparition , and when it's not done property it can lead to nasty complications . 
Everyone around the table except Harry winced . 
" Er - splinched ? " said Harry . 
" So , of course , they were stuck . 
Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out . 
Meant a fair old bit of paperwork , I can tell you , what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they'd left behind ..... " Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of Privet Drive . 
" Oh yes , " said Mr . Weasley matter - of - factly . 
" But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it ? " 
" Charlie had to take the test twice , " said Fred , grinning . 
" He failed the first time . 
" Yes , well , he passed the second time , " said Mrs . Weasley , marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers . 
" Percy only passed two weeks ago , " said George . 
There were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into the kitchen , both looking pale and drowsy . 
" Why do we have to be up so early ? " 
Ginny said , rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table . 
" We ' ve got a bit of a walk , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Walk ? " said Harry . 
" What , are we walking to the World Cup ? " " No , no , that's miles away , " said Mr . Weasley , smiling . 
" We only need to walk a short way . 
It's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention . 
We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times , and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup ... " " George ! " said Mrs . Weasley sharply , and they all jumped . 
" What ? " said George , in an innocent tone that deceived nobody . 
" What is that in your pocket ? " " Nothing ! " 
" Don't you lie to me ! " 
Mrs . Weasley pointed her wand at George's pocket and said , " Accio ! " 
Several small , brightly colored objects zoomed out of George's pocket ; he made a grab for them but missed , and they sped right into Mrs . 
Weasley's outstretched hand . 
" We told you to get rid of the lot ! 
Empty your pockets , go on , both of you ! " 
It was an unpleasant scene ; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible , and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs . Weasley managed to find them all . 
" Accio ! 
Accio ! 
Accio ! " she shouted , and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places , including the lining of George's jacket and the turn - ups of Fred's jeans . 
Fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away . 
Mrs . Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr . Weasley on the cheek , though not nearly as much as the twins , who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her . " Well , have a lovely time , " said Mrs . Weasley , " and behave yourselves , " she called after the twins ' retreating backs , but they did not look back or answer . 
" I ' ll send Bill , Charlie , and Percy along around midday , " Mrs . Weasley said to Mr . Weasley , as he , Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George . 
It was chilly and the moon was still out . 
Harry , having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World Cup , sped up to walk with Mr . Weasley . 
" So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing ? " he asked . 
" It's been a massive organizational problem , " sighed Mr . Weasley . 
So we had to find a nice deserted moor , and set up as many anti - Muggle precautions as possible . 
The whole Ministry's been working on it for months . 
First , of course , we have to stagger the arrivals . 
Some Apparate , of course , but we have to set up safe points for them to appear , well away from Muggles . 
You can do large groups at a time if you need to . 
There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain , and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill , so that's where we ' re headed . " 
Mr . Weasley pointed ahead of them , where a large black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St . Catchpole . 
" What sort of objects are Portkeys ? " said Harry curiously . 
" Well , they can be anything , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Unobtrusive things , obviously , so Muggles don't go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they ' ll just think is litter .... " They trudged down the dark , dank lane toward the village , the silence broken only by their footsteps . 
The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village , its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue . 
Harry's hands and feet were freezing . 
Mr . Weasley kept checking his watch . 
They didn't have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill , stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes , slipping on thick black tuffets of grass . 
Each breath Harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when , at last , his feet found level ground . 
" Whew , " panted Mr . Weasley , taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater . 
Hermione came over the crest of the hill last , clutching a stitch in her side . 
" Now we just need the Portkey , " said Mr . Weasley , replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground . 
" It won't be big .... Come on ... " They spread out , searching . 
" Over here , Arthur ! 
Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop . 
" Amos ! " said Mr . Weasley , smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted . 
The rest of them followed . 
Mr . Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy - faced wizard with a scrubby brown beard , who was holding a moldy - looking old boot in his other hand . 
" This is Amos Diggory , everyone , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . 
And I think you know his son , Cedric ? " Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen . 
He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts . 
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George , who merely nodded . 
They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team , Gryffindor , in the first Quidditch match of the previous year . 
" Not too bad , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" We live just on the other side of the village there . 
You ? " " Had to get up at two , didn't we , Ced ? 
I tell you , I ' ll be glad when he's got his Apparition test . 
Amos Diggory peered good - naturedly around at the three Weasley boys , Harry , Hermione , and Ginny . 
" This is Hermione , friend of Ron's - and Harry , another friend - " " Merlin's beard , " said Amos Diggory , his eyes widening . 
" Harry ? 
Harry Potter ? " " Er - yeah , " said Harry . 
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him , used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead , but it always made him feel uncomfortable . 
" Told us all about playing against you last year ... I said to him , I said - Ced , that ' ll be something to tell your grandchildren , that will .... 
You beat Harry Potter ! " Harry couldn't think of any reply to this , so he remained silent . 
Fred and George were both scowling again . 
I told you ... it was an accident .... " " Yes , but you didn't fall off , did you ? " roared Amos genially , slapping his son on his back . 
" Always modest , our Ced , always the gentleman ... but the best man won , I'm sure Harry'd say the same , wouldn't you , eh ? 
One falls off his broom , one stays on , you don't need to be a genius to tell which one's the better flier ! " " Must be nearly time , " said Mr . Weasley quickly , pulling out his watch again . 
" Not that I know of , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Yes , it's a minute off ... We'd better get ready .... " 
He looked around at Harry and Hermione . 
" You just need to touch the Portkey , that's all , a finger will do - " With difficulty , owing to their bulky backpacks , the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory . 
They all stood there , in a tight circle , as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop . 
one . . 
It happened immediately : Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward . 
His feet left the ground ; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him , their shoulders banging into his ; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color ; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then His feet slammed into the ground ; Ron staggered into him and he fell over ; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud . 
Harry looked up . 
Mr . Weasley , Mr . Diggory , and Cedric were still standing , though looking very windswept ; everybody else was on the ground . 
" Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill , " said a voice . 
Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet . 
In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy - looking wizards , one of whom was holding a large gold watch , the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill . 
Both were dressed as Muggles , though very inexpertly : The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thighlength galoshes ; his colleague , a kilt and a poncho . 
" Morning , Basil , " said Mr . Weasley , picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard , who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him ; Harry could see an old newspaper , an empty drinks can , and a punctured football . 
" Hello there , Arthur , " said Basil wearily . 
Hang on , I ' ll find your campsite .... Weasley ... Weasley .... " 
" About a quarter of a mile's walk over there , first field you come to . 
Site manager's called Mr . Roberts . 
Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr . Payne . " 
" Thanks , Basil , " said Mr . Weasley , and he beckoned everyone to follow him . 
They set off across the deserted moor , unable to make out much through the mist . 
Beyond it , Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents , rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon . 
They said good - bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door . 
A man was standing in the doorway , looking out at the tents . 
Harry knew at a glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres . 
When he heard their footsteps , he turned his head to look at them . 
" Morning ! " said Mr . Weasley brightly . 
" Morning , " said the Muggle . 
" Would you be Mr . Roberts ? " " Aye , I would , " said Mr . Roberts . 
Just the one night ? " 
" That's it , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" You ' ll be paying now , then ? " said Mr . Roberts . 
" Ah - right - certainly - " said Mr . Weasley . 
He retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him . 
" Help me , Harry , " he muttered , pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart . 
" This one's a - a - a ten ? 
So this is a five ? " " A twenty , " Harry corrected him in an undertone , uncomfortably aware of Mr . Roberts trying to catch every word . 
" Ah yes , so it is .... 
I don't know , these little bits of paper ... " " You foreign ? " said Mr . Roberts as Mr . Weasley returned with the correct notes . 
repeated Mr . Weasley , puzzled . 
" You ' re not the first one who's had trouble with money , " said Mr . Roberts , scrutinizing Mr . Weasley closely . 
" I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago . " 
" Did you really ? " said Mr . Weasley nervously . 
Mr . Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change . 
" Never been this crowded , " he said suddenly , looking out over the misty field again . 
" Hundreds of pre - bookings . 
People usually just turn up .... " " Is that right ? " said Mr . Weasley , his hand held out for his change , but Mr . Roberts didn't give it to him . 
" People from all over . 
And not just foreigners . 
Weirdos , you know ? 
There's a bloke walking ' round in a kilt and a poncho . " 
" Shouldn't he ? " said Mr . Weasley anxiously " It's like some sort of ... 
I dunno ... like some sort of rally , " said Mr . Roberts . 
" They all seem to know each other . 
Like a big party . " 
At that moment , a wizard in plus - fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr . Roberts's front door . 
" Obliviate ! " he said sharply , pointing his wand at Mr . Roberts . 
Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified . 
" A map of the campsite for you , " Mr . Roberts said placidly to Mr . Weasley . 
" And your change . " 
" Thanks very much , " said Mr . Weasley . 
The wizard in plus - fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite . 
He looked exhausted : His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes . 
Once out of earshot of Mr . Roberts , he muttered to Mr . Weasley , " Been having a lot of trouble with him . 
And Ludo Bagman's not helping . 
See you later , Arthur . " 
He Disapparated . 
" I thought Mr . Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports , " said Ginny , looking surprised . 
" He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles , shouldn't he ? " " He should , " said Mr . Weasley , smiling , and leading them through the gates into the campsite , " but Ludo's always been a bit ... well . . . 
And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had . " 
They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents . 
A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets ; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached , complete with birdbath , sundial , and fountain . 
" Always the same , " said Mr . Weasley , smiling . 
Ah , here we are , look , this is us . " 
They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field , and here was an empty space , with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY . 
" Couldn't have a better spot ! " said Mr . Weasley happily . 
" The field is just on the other side of the wood there , we ' re as close as we could be . " 
He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders . 
" Right , " he said excitedly , " no magic allowed , strictly speaking , not when we ' re out in these numbers on Muggle land . 
We ' ll be putting these tents up by hand ! 
Shouldn't be too difficult .... Muggles do it all the time .... Here , Harry , where do you reckon we should start ? " 
Harry had never been camping in his life ; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday , preferring to leave him with Mrs . Figg , an old neighbor . 
However , he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go , and though Mr . Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help , because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet , they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two - man tents . 
All of them stood back to admire their handiwork . 
Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards , Harry thought , but the trouble was that once Bill , Charlie , and Percy arrived , they would be a party of ten . 
Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too ; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr . Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent . 
Oddly enough , it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs . Figg's house : There were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats . 
" Well , it's not for long , " said Mr . Weasley , mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom . 
I borrowed this from Perkins at the office . 
He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it . 
" We ' ll need water .... " There's a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us , " said Ron , who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions . 
" It's on the other side of the field . " 
" Well , why don't you , Harry , and Hermione go and get us some water then " - Mr . Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans - " and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire ? " " But we ' ve got an oven , " said Ron . " Why can't we just - " " Ron , anti - Muggle security ! " said Mr . Weasley , his face shining with anticipation . 
I ' ve seen them at it ! " 
After a quick tour of the girls ' tent , which was slightly smaller than the boys ' , though without the smell of cats , Harry , Ron , and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans . 
Now , with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting , they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction . 
They made their way slowly through the rows , staring eagerly around . 
It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world ; he had never really thought much about those in other countries . 
Their fellow campers were starting to wake up . 
First to stir were the families with small children ; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before . 
A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid - shaped tent , holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass , which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami . 
As they drew level with him , his mother came hurrying out of the tent . 
" How many times , Kevin ? 
Her scolding carried after them on the still air , mingling with the little boy's yells - " You bust slug ! 
You bust slug ! " 
A short way farther on , they saw two little witches , barely older than Kevin , who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls ' toes to skim the dewy grass . 
Three African wizards sat in serious conversation , all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire , while a group of middle - aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read : THE SALEM WITCHES ' INSTITUTE . 
Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed , and though he couldn't understand a word , the tone of every single voice was excited . 
It wasn't just Ron's eyes . 
They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks , so that it looked as though small , oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth . 
" Harry ! 
Ron ! Hermione ! " 
It was Seamus Finnigan , their fellow Gryffindor fourth year . 
He was sitting in front of his own shamrock - covered tent , with a sandy - haired woman who had to be his mother , and his best friend , Dean Thomas , also of Gryffindor . 
" You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents . 
" Let's go and have a look , " said Harry , pointing to a large patch of tents upfield , where the Bulgarian flag - white , green , and red - was fluttering in the breeze . 
The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life , but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it , a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows . 
The picture was , of course , moving , but all it did was blink and scowl . 
" Krum , " said Ron quietly . 
" What ? " said Hermione . 
" Krum ! " said Ron . " Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian Seeker ! " " He looks really grumpy , " said Hermione , looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them . 
" ' Really grumpy ? " 
Ron raised his eyes to the heavens . 
He's unbelievable . 
He's really young too . 
He's a genius , you wait until tonight , you ' ll see . " 
There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field . 
One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown . 
The other was clearly a Ministry wizard ; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation . 
You can't walk around like that , the Muggle at the gate's already getting suspicious I bought this in a Muggle shop , " said the old wizard stubbornly . 
" Muggle women wear them , Archie , not the men , they wear these , " said the Ministry wizard , and he brandished the pinstriped trousers . 
" I'm not putting them on , " said old Archie in indignation . 
Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away . 
Walking more slowly now , because of the weight of the water , they made their way back through the campsite . 
Oliver Wood , the old captain of Harry's House Quidditch team , who had just left Hogwarts , dragged Harry over to his parents ' tent to introduce him , and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team . 
Next they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan , a Hufflepuff fourth year , and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang , a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team . 
She waved and smiled at Harry , who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back . 
More to stop Ron from smirking than anything , Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before . 
" Who d ' you reckon they are ? " he said . 
" ' Spect they go to some foreign school , " said Ron . " I know there are others . 
He supposed , now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite , that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn't be the only one . 
He glanced at Hermione , who looked utterly unsurprised by the information . 
No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other . 
" You ' ve been ages , " said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys ' tents . 
Splintered matches littered the ground around him , but he looked as though he was having the time of his life . 
" Oops ! " he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise . 
At last they got the fire lit , though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything . 
Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field , and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it , greeting Mr . Weasley cordially as they passed . 
Mr . Weasley kept up a running commentary , mainly for Harry's and Hermione's benefit ; his own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested . 
Here comes Gilbert Wimple ; he's with the Committee on Experimental Charms ; he's had those horns for a while now ... Hello , Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood , he's an Obliviator member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad , you know ... and that's Bode and Croaker ... they ' re Unspeakables .... " 
" They're what ? " " From the Department of Mysteries , top secret , no idea what they get up to .... " At last , the fire was ready , and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when Bill , Charlie , and Percy came strolling out of the woods toward them . 
" Just Apparated , Dad , " said Percy loudly . 
They were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr . Weasley jumped to his feet , waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them . 
" Aha ! " he said . 
" The man of the moment ! 
Ludo ! " Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far , even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress . 
An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest . 
He had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed ; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England . 
His nose was squashed ( probably broken by a stray Bludger , Harry thought ) , but his round blue eyes , short blond hair , and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy . 
" Ahoy there ! " 
Bagman called happily . 
He was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement . 
What a day ! 
Not much for me to do ! " Behind him , a group of haggard - looking Ministry wizards rushed past , pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air . 
Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched . 
Apparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression . 
" Ah - yes , " said Mr . Weasley , grinning , " this is my son Percy . 
He's just started at the Ministry - and this is Fred - no , George , sorry - that's Fred - Bill , Charlie , Ron - my daughter , Ginny and Ron's friends , Hermione Granger and Harry Potter . " Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry's name , and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry's forehead . 
" Everyone , " Mr . Weasley continued , " this is Ludo Bagman , you know who he is , it's thanks to him we ' ve got such good tickets - " Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing . 
" Fancy a flutter on the match , Arthur ? " he said eagerly , jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow - and - black robes . 
" I ' ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first - I offered him nice odds , considering Ireland's front three are the strongest I ' ve seen in years - and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match . " 
" Oh ... go on then , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Very well , very well ... any other takers ? " 
" They're a bit young to be gambling , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Molly wouldn't like - " " We ' ll bet thirty - seven Galleons , fifteen Sickles , three Knuts , " said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all their money , " that Ireland wins - but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch . 
Oh and we ' ll throw in a fake wand . " 
" Excellent ! 
" They're old enough to know what they want ! 
You reckon Ireland will win but Krum ' ll get the Snitch ? 
Not a chance , boys , not a chance .... I ' ll give you excellent odds on that one .... We ' ll add five Galleons for the funny wand , then , shall we .... " Mr . Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins ' names . 
" Cheers , " said George , taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes . 
Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr . Weasley . 
He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages . " 
" Mr . 
" He speaks over two hundred ! 
Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll . . 
. " " Anyone can speak Troll , " said Fred dismissively . 
Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil . 
Mr . Weasley asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all . 
" Not a dicky bird , " said Bagman comfortably . 
" You don't think it might be time to send someone to look for her ? " 
" Barty Crouch keeps saying that , " said Bagman , his round eyes widening innocently , " but we really can't spare anyone at the moment . 
Oh - talk of the devil ! 
Barty ! " 
The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight , and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule . 
Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him . 
" No thank you , Ludo , " said Crouch , and there was a bite of impatience in his voice . 
I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers . 
" Mr . 
Crouch ! " said Percy breathlessly , sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback . 
" Would you like a cup of tea ? " " Oh , " said Mr . Crouch , looking over at Percy in mild surprise . 
" Yes - thank you , Weatherby . " 
Fred and George choked into their own cups . 
Percy , very pink around the ears , busied himself with the kettle . 
" Oh and I ' ve been wanting a word with you too , Arthur , " said Mr . Crouch , his sharp eyes falling upon Mr . Weasley . 
He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets . " 
Mr . Weasley heaved a deep sigh . 
" I sent him an owl about that just last week . 
If I ' ve told him once I ' ve told him a hundred times : Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects , but will he listen ? " 
" I doubt it , " said Mr . Crouch , accepting a cup from Percy . 
" He's desperate to export here . " 
" Well , they ' ll never replace brooms in Britain , will they ? " said Bagman . 
" Ali thinks there's a niche in the market for a family vehicle , said Mr . Crouch . 
" I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve - but that was before carpets were banned , of course . " 
" Fairly , " said Mr . Crouch dryly . 
" Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat , Ludo . " " I expect you ' ll both be glad when this is over ? " said Mr . Weasley . 
Ludo Bagman looked shocked . 
Mr . Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman . 
" We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details - " " Oh details ! " said Bagman , waving the word away like a cloud of midges . 
I bet you anything these kids ' ll know soon enough anyway . 
I mean , it's happening at Hogwarts - " " Ludo , we need to meet the Bulgarians , you know , " said Mr . Crouch sharply , cutting Bagman's remarks short . 
" Thank you for the tea , Weatherby . " 
He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise ; Bagman struggled to his feet , swigging down the last of his tea , the gold in his pockets chinking merrily . 
" See you all later ! " he said . 
" You ' ll be up in the Top Box with me - I'm commentating ! " 
He waved , Barty Crouch nodded curtly , and both of them Disapparated . 
" What's happening at Hogwarts , Dad ? " said Fred at once . 
" What were they talking about ? " " You ' ll find out soon enough , " said Mr . Weasley , smiling . 
" It's classified information , until such time as the Ministry decides to release it , " said Percy stiffly . 
" Mr . 
Crouch was quite right not to disclose it . " 
" Oh shut up , Weatherby , " said Fred . 
A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on . 
By dusk , the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation , and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards , the last vestiges of pretence disappeared : the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere . 
There were luminous rosettes - green for Ireland , red for Bulgaria - which were squealing the names of the players , pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks , Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared , flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved ; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew , and collectible figures of famous players , which strolled across the palm of your hand , preening themselves . 
Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette , he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian Seeker . 
The miniature Krum walked backward and forward over Ron's hand , scowling up at the green rosette above him . 
" Wish I hadn't bought this now , " said Ron , gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars . 
" Three pairs , " said Harry firmly to the wizard . 
" No - don't bother , " said Ron , going red . 
He was always touchy about the fact that 
" You won't be getting anything for Christmas , " Harry told him , thrusting Omnioculars into his and Hermione's hands . 
" Fair enough , " said Ron , grinning . 
" Oooh , thanks , Harry , " said Hermione . 
Bill , Charlie , and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too , and Mr . Weasley was carrying an Irish flag . 
Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold . 
And then a deep , booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods , and at once , green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees , lighting a path to the field . 
" Come on , let's go ! " 
Clutching their purchases , Mr . Weasley in the lead , they all hurried into the wood , following the lantern - lit trail . 
They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them , shouts and laughter , snatches of singing . 
They walked through the wood for twenty minutes , talking and joking loudly , until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium . 
" Seats a hundred thousand , " said Mr . Weasley , spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face . 
" Prime seats ! " said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets . 
The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple . 
They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd , which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right . 
Mr . Weasley's party kept climbing , and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box , set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts . 
About twenty purple - and - gilt chairs stood in two rows here , and Harry , filing into the front seats with the Weasleys , looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined . 
A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats , which rose in levels around the long oval field . 
Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light , which seemed to come from the stadium itself . 
Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again ; watching it , Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field . 
Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them . 
So far it was empty , except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them . 
The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers , revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato . 
Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been , a teeny , quivering squeak of a voice , and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a house - elf - that this one might just be female . 
Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look . 
Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry , they had never actually met him . 
Even Mr . Weasley looked around in interest . 
" Sorry , " Harry told the elf , " I just thought you were someone I knew . " 
" But I knows Dobby too , sir ! " squeaked the elf . 
" You is surely Harry Potter ! " " Yeah , I am , " said Harry . 
" How is he ? " said Harry . 
" Ah , sir , " said Winky , shaking her head , " ah sir , meaning no disrespect , sir , but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor , sir , when you is setting him free . " 
" Why ? " said Harry , taken aback . 
" What's wrong with him ? " 
" Freedom is going to Dobby's head , sir , " said Winky sadly . 
" No , no , no . 
I says to Dobby , I says , go find yourself a nice family and settle down , Dobby . 
He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks , sir , what is unbecoming to a house - elf . 
You goes racketing around like this , Dobby , I says , and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , like some common goblin . " 
" Master - master wants me to save him a seat , Harry Potter . 
Winky is a good house - elf . " 
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again . 
Harry turned back to the others . 
" So that's a house - elf ? " 
Ron muttered . 
" Weird things , aren't they ? " " Dobby was weirder , " said Harry fervently . 
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them , staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium . 
" Wild ! " he said , twiddling the replay knob on the side . 
I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again . . 
" ' A display from the team mascots will precede the match , "'she read aloud . 
" Oh that's always worth watching , " said Mr . Weasley . 
Mr . Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards . 
Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog . 
When Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic himself , arrived , Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered . 
They had met before , and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion , asked how he was , and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him . 
" Harry Potter , you know , " he told the Bulgarian minister loudly , who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to understand a word of English . 
" Harry Potter ... oh come on now , you know who he is ... the boy who survived You - Know - Who ... you do know who he is - " The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry's scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly , pointing at it . 
" Knew we'd get there in the end , " said Fudge wearily to Harry . 
Edging along the second row to three still - empty seats right behind Mr . Weasley were none other than Dobby the houseelf's former owners : Lucius Malfoy ; his son , Draco ; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco's mother . 
Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts . 
A pale boy with a pointed face and white - blond hair , Draco greatly resembled his father . 
His mother was blonde too ; tall and slim , she would have been nice - looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose . 
" Ah , Fudge , " said Mr . Malfoy , holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of Magic . 
" How are you ? 
I don't think you ' ve met my wife , Narcissa ? 
Or our son , Draco ? " " How do you do , how do you do ? " said Fudge , smiling and bowing to Mrs . Malfoy . 
" And allow me to introduce you to Mr . Oblansk - Obalonsk - Mr . - well , he's the Bulgarian Minister of Magic , and he can't understand a word I'm saying anyway , so never mind . 
And let's see who else - you know Arthur Weasley , I daresay ? " 
It was a tense moment . 
Mr . Weasley and Mr . Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face - to - face : It had been in Flourish and Blotts ' bookshop , and they had had a fight . 
Mr . Malfoy's cold gray eyes swept over Mr . Weasley , and then up and down the row . 
" Good lord , Arthur , " he said softly . 
" What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box ? Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much ? " 
He's here as my guest . " 
" How - how nice , " said Mr . Weasley , with a very strained smile . 
Mr . Malfoy's eyes had returned to Hermione , who went slightly pink , but stared determinedly back at him . 
Harry knew exactly what was making Mr . Malfoy's lip curl like that . 
However , under the gaze of the Minister of Magic , Mr . Malfoy didn't dare say anything . 
He nodded sneeringly to Mr . Weasley and continued down the line to his seats . 
Draco shot Harry , Ron , and Hermione one contemptuous look , then settled himself between his mother and father . 
" Slimy gits , " Ron muttered as he , Harry , and Hermione turned to face the field again . 
Next moment , Ludo Bagman charged into the box . 
Ludo whipped out his wand , directed it at his own throat , and said " Sonorus ! " and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium ; his voice echoed over them , booming into every corner of the stands . 
" Ladies and gentlemen . . . 
welcome ! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty - second Quidditch World Cup ! " The spectators screamed and clapped . 
" I wonder what they ' ve brought , " said Mr . Weasley , leaning forward in his seat . 
He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes . 
" Veela ! " " What are veel - ? " 
The veela had started to dance , and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank . 
All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela , because if they stopped dancing , terrible things would happen . 
And as the veela danced faster and faster , wild , half - formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind . 
He wanted to do something very impressive , right now . 
Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea . . . 
" Harry , what are you doing ? " said Hermione's voice from a long way off . 
The music stopped . 
Harry blinked . 
He was standing up , and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box . 
Next to him , Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard . 
The crowd didn't want the veela to go . 
Harry was with them ; he would , of course , be supporting Bulgaria , and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest . 
Ron , meanwhile , was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat . 
Mr . Weasley , smiling slightly , leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands . 
" Huh ? " said Ron , staring openmouthed at the veela , who had now lined up along one side of the field . 
She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat . 
" Honestly ! " 
she said . 
" And now , " roared Ludo Bagman's voice , " kindly put your wands in the air . . . 
for the Irish National Team Mascots ! " Next moment , what seemed to be a great green - and - gold comet came zooming into the stadium . 
It did one circuit of the stadium , then split into two smaller comets , each hurtling toward the goal posts . 
A rainbow arced suddenly across the field , connecting the two balls of light . 
Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged ; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock , which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands . 
Squinting up at the shamrock , Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests , each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green . 
" Leprechauns ! " said Mr . Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd , many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold . 
Now you ' ve got to buy me a Christmas present , ha ! " The great shamrock dissolved , the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela , and settled themselves cross - legged to watch the match . 
" And now , ladies and gentlemen , kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team ! 
I give you - Dimitrov ! " 
" Ivanova ! " 
Levski ! 
Vulchanov ! 
Volkov ! 
Aaaaaaand - Krum ! " " That's him , that's him ! " 
Viktor Krum was thin , dark , and sallow - skinned , with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows . 
He looked like an overgrown bird of prey . 
It was hard to believe he was only eighteen . 
" And now , please greet - the Irish National Quidditch Team ! " yelled Bagman . 
Ryan ! Troy ! Mullet ! 
Moran ! 
Quigley ! 
Aaaaaand Lynch ! " Seven green blurs swept onto the field ; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word " Firebolt " on each of their brooms and see their names , embroidered in silver , upon their backs . 
" And here , all the way from Egypt , our referee , acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch , Hassan Mostafa ! " 
A small and skinny wizard , completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon's , wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium , strode out onto the field . 
A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache , and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm , his broomstick under the other . 
Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal , watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into the air : the scarlet Quaffle , the two black Bludgers , and ( Harry saw it for the briefest moment , before it sped out of sight ) the minuscule , winged Golden Snitch . 
With a sharp blast on his whistle , Mostafa shot into the air after the balls . 
" Theeeeeeeey ' re OFF ! " screamed Bagman . 
" And it's Mullet ! 
Troy ! Moran ! 
Dimitrov ! 
Troy ! Levski ! 
Moran ! " 
It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before . 
He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose . 
The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names . 
Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again , pressed the playby - play button on the top , and he was immediately watching in slow motion , while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums . 
HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION , he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together , Troy in the center , slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran , bearing down upon the Bulgarians . 
PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next , as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle , drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran . 
One of the Bulgarian Beaters , Volkov , swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club , knocking it into Moran's path ; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle ; and Levski , soaring beneath , caught it - " TROY SCORES ! " roared Bagman , and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers . 
Harry yelled , looking wildly around through his Omnioculars . 
" But Levski's got the Quaffle ! " " Harry , if you ' re not going to watch at normal speed , you ' re going to miss things ! " shouted Hermione , who was dancing up and down , waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field . 
Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great , glittering shamrock . 
Across the field , the veela were watching them sulkily . 
Furious with himself , Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed . 
They worked as a seamless team , their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves , and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names : " Troy - Mullet - Mo ran ! " 
And within ten minutes , Ireland had scored twice more , bringing their lead to thirty - zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the greenclad supporters . 
The match became still faster , but more brutal . 
Volkov and Vulchanov , the Bulgarian Beaters , were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers , and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves ; twice they were forced to scatter , and then , finally , Ivanova managed to break through their ranks ; dodge the Keeper , Ryan ; and score Bulgaria's first goal . 
" Fingers in your ears ! " bellowed Mr . Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration . 
Harry screwed up his eyes too ; he wanted to keep his mind on the game . 
After a few seconds , he chanced a glance at the field . 
The veela had stopped dancing , and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle . 
" Dimitrov ! 
Levski ! 
Dimitrov ! 
One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers , Krum and Lynch , plummeted through the center of the Chasers , so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes . 
Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars , squinting to see where the Snitch was " They're going to crash ! " screamed Hermione next to Harry . 
She was half right - at the very last second , Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off . 
Lynch , however , hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium . 
" Fool ! " moaned Mr . Weasley . 
" Krum was feinting ! " 
" It's time - out ! " 
Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny , who was hanging over the side of the box , looking horror - struck . 
Harry hastily pressed the replay and play - by - play buttons on his Omnioculars , twiddled the speed dial , and put them back up to his eyes . 
He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion . 
He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time , while Lynch was flattened , and he understood - Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all , he was just making Lynch copy him . 
Harry had never seen anyone fly like that ; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all ; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless . 
Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum . 
He was now circling high above Lynch , who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion . 
Harry , focusing still more closely upon Krum's face , saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below . 
He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference . 
Lynch got to his feet at last , to loud cheers from the green - clad supporters , mounted his Firebolt , and kicked back off into the air . 
When Mostafa blew his whistle again , the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far . 
After fifteen more fast and furious minutes , Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals . 
As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again , clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm , the Bulgarian Keeper , Zograf , flew out to meet her . 
" And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing -- excessive use of elbows ! " Bagman informed the roaring spectators . 
" And - yes , it's a penalty to Ireland ! " 
The leprechauns , who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled , now darted together to form the words " HA , HA , HA ! " The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet , tossed their hair angrily , and started to dance again . 
As one , the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears , but Hermione , who hadn't bothered , was soon tugging on Harry's arm . 
He turned to look at her , and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears . 
" Look at the referee ! " she said , giggling . 
Harry looked down at the field . 
Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela , and was acting very oddly indeed . 
He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly . 
" Somebody slap the referee ! " 
A mediwizard came tearing across the field , his fingers stuffed into his own ears , and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins . 
Mostafa seemed to come to himself ; Harry , watching through the Omnioculars again , saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela , who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous . 
" And unless I'm much mistaken , Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots ! " said Bagman's voice . 
It did : The Bulgarian Beaters , Volkov and Vulchanov , landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him , gesticulating toward the leprechauns , who had now gleefully formed the words " HEE , HEE , HEE . " Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians ' arguments , however ; he was jabbing his finger into the air , clearly telling them to get flying again , and when they refused , he gave two short blasts on his whistle . 
" Two penalties for Ireland ! " shouted Bagman , and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger . 
yes . . . 
there they go . . . 
and Troy takes the Quaffle . . 
Dimitrov shot straight at Moran , who had the Quaffle , nearly knocking her off her broom . 
" Foul ! " roared the Irish supporters as one , all standing up in a great wave of green . 
" Foul ! " echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice . 
The leprechauns had risen into the air again , and this time , they formed a giant hand , which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field . 
Instead of dancing , they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns . 
On the contrary , their faces were elongating into sharp , cruelbeaked bird heads , and long , scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders " And that , boys , " yelled Mr . Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below , " is why you should never go for looks alone ! " 
Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns , but with little success ; meanwhile , the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above . 
Harry turned this way and that , staring through his Omnioculars , as the Quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet . 
" Levski - Dimitrov - Moran - Troy - Mullet - Ivanova - Moran again - Moran MORAN SCORES ! " 
But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela , the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members ' wands , and the furious roars of the Bulgarians . 
There was a deafening groan from the crowd ; Krum's nose looked broken , there was blood everywhere , but Hassan Mostafa didn't blow his whistle . 
Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured ; even though he was supporting Ireland , Krum was the most exciting player on the field . 
Ron obviously felt the same . 
Ah , come on , he can't play like that , look at him - " " Look at Lynch ! " Harry yelled . 
For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive , and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint ; this was the real thing ... " He's seen the Snitch ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" He's seen it ! 
How he could see where he was going , Harry had no idea ; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him , but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again " They're going to crash ! " shrieked Hermione . 
" They're not ! " roared Ron . 
" Lynch is ! " yelled Harry . 
And he was right - for the second time , Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela . 
" The Snitch , where's the Snitch ? " bellowed Charlie , along the row . 
" He's got it - Krum's got it - it's all over ! " shouted Harry . 
Krum , his red robes shining with blood from his nose , was rising gently into the air , his fist held high , a glint of gold in his hand . 
The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA : 160 , IRELAND : 170 across the crowd , who didn't seem to have realized what had happened . 
Then , slowly , as though a great jumbo jet were revving up , the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight . 
" IRELAND WINS ! " Bagman shouted , who like the Irish , seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match . 
Ron bellowed , even as he jumped up and down , applauding with his hands over his head . 
" He was very brave , wasn't he ? " Hermione said , leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him . 
" He looks a terrible mess . . 
Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again . 
It was hard to see what was happening below , because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field , but he could just make out Krum , surrounded by mediwizards . 
He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up . 
Flags were waving all over the stadium , the Irish national anthem blared from all sides ; the veela were shrinking back into their usual , beautiful selves now , though looking dispirited and forlorn . 
" Vell , ve fought bravely , " said a gloomy voice behind Harry . 
He looked around ; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic . 
" And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor , flanked by their mascots , the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box ! " roared Bagman . 
Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light , as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside . 
And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players . 
The crowd below was applauding appreciatively ; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction . 
One by one , the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box , and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge . 
Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face . 
He was still holding the Snitch . 
Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground . 
But when Krum's name was announced , the whole stadium gave him a resounding , earsplitting roar . 
And then came the Irish team . 
Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly ; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused . 
But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval . 
Harry's hands were numb with clapping . 
At last , when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms ( Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly's , clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way ) , Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered , " Quietus . " 
Ah yes ... . 
yes , I owe you . . . 
For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces , their hands outstretched . 
Don't tell your mother you ' ve been gambling , " Mr . Weasley implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purple - carpeted stairs . 
We don't want it confiscated . " 
Mr . Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were , but seemed to decide , upon reflection , that he didn't want to know . 
They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites . 
Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern - lit path , and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads , cackling and waving their lanterns . 
When they finally reached the tents , nobody felt like sleeping at all , and given the level of noise around them , Mr . Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in . 
They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match ; Mr . Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie , and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr . Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed . 
Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent , and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks . 
From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang . 
" Oh I am glad I'm not on duty , " muttered Mr . Weasley sleepily . 
" I wouldn't fancy having to go and tell the Irish they ' ve got to stop celebrating . " 
Harry , who was on a top bunk above Ron , lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent , watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead , and picturing again some of Krum's more spectacular moves . 
Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back , and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred - thousand - strong crowd roar , as Ludo Bagman's voice echoed throughout the stadium , " I give you . . . 
" Get up ! Ron - Harry - come on now , get up , this is urgent ! " 
Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas . 
" S ' matter ? " he said . 
Dimly , he could tell that something was wrong . 
The noises in the campsite had changed . 
The singing had stopped . 
He could hear screams , and the sound of people running . 
He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes , but Mr . Weasley , who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas , said , " No time , Harry - just grab a jacket and get outside - quickly ! " Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent , Ron at his heels . 
By the light of the few fires that were still burning , he could see people running away into the woods , fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them , something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire . 
Loud jeering , roars of laughter , and drunken yells were drifting toward them ; then came a burst of strong green light , which illuminated the scene . 
Harry squinted at them . . . . 
They didn't seem to have faces . . . . 
High above them , floating along in midair , four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes . 
It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers , and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air . 
Two of the figures were very small . 
More wizards were joining the marching group , laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies . 
Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand . 
Several caught fire . 
The screaming grew louder . 
The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them : Mr . Roberts , the campsite manager . 
The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children . 
One of the marchers below flipped Mrs . Roberts upside down with his wand ; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee . 
" That's sick , " Ron muttered , watching the smallest Muggle child , who had begun to spin like a top , sixty feet above the ground , his head flopping limply from side to side . 
" That is really sick . . . 
At the same moment , Bill , Charlie , and Percy emerged from the boys ' tent , fully dressed , with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out . 
" We're going to help the Ministry ! " 
Mr . Weasley shouted over all the noise , rolling up his own sleeves . 
" You lot - get into the woods , and stick together . 
Bill , Charlie , and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers ; Mr . Weasley tore after them . 
Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble . 
" C ' mon , " said Fred , grabbing Ginny's hand and starting to pull her toward the wood . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , and George followed . 
They all looked back as they reached the trees . 
The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever ; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center , but they were having great difficulty . 
It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall . 
The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished . 
Dark figures were blundering through the trees ; children were crying ; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air . 
Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see . 
Then he heard Ron yell with pain . 
" Ron , where are you ? 
Oh this is stupid - lumos ! " 
She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path . 
Ron was lying sprawled on the ground . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione turned sharply . 
Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby , leaning against a tree , looking utterly relaxed . 
His arms folded , he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees . 
Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs . Weasley . 
" Language , Weasley , " said Malfoy , his pale eyes glittering . 
He nodded at Hermione , and at the same moment , a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite , and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them . 
" What's that supposed to mean ? " said Hermione defiantly . 
" Granger , they ' re after Muggles , " said Malfoy . 
" D ' you want to be showing off your knickers in midair ? 
Because if you do , hang around . . . 
" Hermione's a witch , " Harry snarled . 
" If you think they can't spot a Mudblood , stay where you are . " " You watch your mouth ! " shouted Ron . 
Everybody present knew that " Mudblood " was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage . 
" Never mind , Ron , " said Hermione quickly , seizing Ron's arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy . 
There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard . 
Several people nearby screamed . 
" I suppose your daddy told you all to hide ? 
What's he up to - trying to rescue the Muggles ? " " Where ' re your parents ? " said Harry , his temper rising . 
" Out there wearing masks , are they ? " 
Malfoy turned his face to Harry , still smiling . 
" Well . . . 
" Come on , " Hermione repeated , and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again . 
" I ' ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot ! " said Ron hotly . 
" Well , with any luck , the Ministry will catch him ! " said Hermione fervently . 
" Oh I can't believe this . 
Where have the others got to ? " Fred , George , and Ginny were nowhere to be seen , though the path was packed with plenty of other people , all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite . 
A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path . 
When they saw Harry , Ron , and Hermione , a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly , " Oü est Madame Maxime ? 
Nous l ' avons perdue - " " Er - what ? " said Ron . " Oh . . 
The girl who had spoken turned her back on him , and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say , " Ogwarts . " 
" Beauxbatons , " muttered Hermione . 
" Sorry ? " said Harry . 
" They must go to Beauxbatons , " said Hermione . 
" You know ... Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . 
" Oh . . . 
right , " said Harry . 
" Fred and George can't have gone that far , " said Ron , pulling out his wand , lighting it like Hermione's , and squinting up the path . 
Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand - but it wasn't there . 
The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars . 
" Ah , no , I don't believe it . . . 
I ' ve lost my wand ! " " You ' re kidding ! " Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground ; Harry looked all around him , but his wand was nowhere to be seen . 
" Maybe it's back in the tent , " said Ron . " Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running ? " 
Hermione suggested anxiously . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , " maybe . . 
He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world , and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable . 
Winky the house - elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby . 
She was moving in a most peculiar fashion , apparently with great difficulty ; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back . 
" People high - high in the air ! 
Winky is getting out of the way ! " 
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path , panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her . 
" Why can't she run properly ? " 
" Bet she didn't ask permission to hide , " said Harry . 
He was thinking of Dobby : Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn't like , the house - elf had been forced to start beating himself up . 
" It's slavery , that's what it is ! 
That Mr . Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium , and she was terrified , and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run when they start trampling tents ! 
Why doesn't anyone do something about it ? " 
" Well , the elves are happy , aren't they ? " Ron said . 
' House - elves is not supposed to have fun ' . . . 
. " " It's people like you , Ron , " Hermione began hotly , " who prop up rotten and unjust systems , just because they ' re too lazy to - " Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood . 
" Let's just keep moving , shall we ? " said Ron , and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione . 
They set off again , Harry still searching his pockets , even though he knew his wand wasn't there . 
They followed the dark path deeper into the wood , still keeping an eye out for Fred , George , and Ginny . 
They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match , and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite . 
Farther still along the path , they walked into a patch of silvery light , and when they looked through the trees , they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing , surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards , all of whom were talking very loudly . 
" I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year ! " one of them shouted . 
" I'm a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . " 
but I'm a vampire hunter , I ' ve killed about ninety so far - " A third young wizard , whose pimples were visible even by the dim , silvery light of the veela , now cut in , " I'm about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic , I am . " 
Harry snorted with laughter . 
He recognized the pimply wizard : His name was Stan Shunpike , and he was in fact a conductor on the triple - decker Knight Bus . 
He turned to tell Ron this , but Ron's face had gone oddly slack , and next second Ron was yelling , " Did I tell you I ' ve invented a broomstick that ' ll reach Jupiter ? " " Honestly ! " said Hermione , and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms , wheeled him around , and marched him away . 
By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely , they were in the very heart of the wood . 
Harry looked around . 
" I reckon we can just wait here , you know . 
The words were hardly out of his mouth , when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them . 
Even by the feeble light of the two wands , Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman . 
He no longer looked buoyant and rosy - faced ; there was no more spring in his step . 
He looked very white and strained . 
" What are you doing in here , all alone ? " 
" What ? " " At the campsite . . . 
some people have got hold of a family of Muggles . . . 
Bagman swore loudly . 
" Damn them ! " he said , looking quite distracted , and without another word , he Disapparated with a small pop ! " Not exactly on top of things , Mr . Bagman , is he ? " said Hermione , frowning . 
" He was a great Beater , though , " said Ron , leading the way off the path into a small clearing , and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree . 
He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket , set it down on the ground , and watched it walk around . 
Like the real Krum , the model was slightly duck - footed and round - shouldered , much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick . 
Harry was listening for noise from the campsite . 
" I hope the others are okay , " said Hermione after a while . 
" They ' ll be fine , " said Ron . " Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy , " said Harry , sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves . 
" Mad , though , to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic's out here tonight ! " said Hermione . 
" I mean , how do they expect to get away with it ? 
Harry and Ron looked quickly around too . 
It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing . 
They waited , listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees . 
But the footsteps came to a sudden halt . 
" Hello ? " called Harry . 
There was silence . 
Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree . 
It was too dark to see very far , but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision . 
" Who's there ? " he said . 
And then , without warning , the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood ; and it uttered , not a panicked shout , but what sounded like a spell . 
And something vast , green , and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate ; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky . 
" What the - ? " gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again , staring up at the thing that had appeared . 
For a split second , Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation . 
Then he realized that it was a colossal skull , comprised of what looked like emerald stars , with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue . 
As they watched , it rose higher and higher , blazing in a haze of greenish smoke , etched against the black sky like a new constellation . 
Harry didn't understand why , but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull , which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign . 
He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull , but he couldn't see anyone . 
" Who's there ? " he called again . 
" What's the matter ? " 
Harry said , startled to see her face so white and terrified . 
" You - Know - Who's sign ! " " Voldemort's - " Harry , come on ! " 
Harry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of them started across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps , a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards , appearing from thin air , surrounding them . 
Harry whirled around , and in an instant , he registered one fact : Each of these wizards had his wand out , and every wand was pointing right at himself , Ron , and Hermione . 
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground . 
roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing . 
Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards ' wands , crossing one another , bouncing off tree trunks , rebounding into the darkness - " Stop ! " 
That's my son ! " Harry's hair stopped blowing about . 
He raised his head a little higher . 
The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand . 
He rolled over and saw Mr . Weasley striding toward them , looking terrified . 
" Ron - Harry " - his voice sounded shaky - " Hermione - are you all right ? " 
" Out of the way , Arthur , " said a cold , curt voice . 
It was Mr . Crouch . 
He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them . 
Harry got to his feet to face them . 
Mr . Crouch's face was taut with rage . 
" Which of you did it ? " 
" Which of you conjured the Dark Mark ? " " We didn't do that ! " said Harry , gesturing up at the skull . 
" We didn't do anything ! " said Ron , who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father . 
" What did you want to attack us for ? " " Do not lie , sir ! " shouted Mr . Crouch . 
His wand was still pointing directly at Ron , and his eyes were popping - he looked slightly mad . 
" You have been discovered at the scene of the crime ! " " Barty , " whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown , " they ' re kids , Barty , they'd never have been able to " Where did the Mark come from , you three ? " said Mr . Weasley quickly . 
" Over there , " said Hermione shakily , pointing at the place where they had heard the voice . 
" There was someone behind the trees . . . 
But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr . Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry , Ron , or Hermione had conjured the skull ; on the contrary , at Hermione's words , they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated , squinting through the dark trees . 
" We're too late , " said the witch in the woolen dressing gown , shaking her head . 
" They ' ll have Disapparated . " 
It was Amos Diggory , Cedric's father . 
There's a good chance we got them . . . 
" Amos , be careful ! " said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr . Diggory squared his shoulders , raised his wand , marched across the clearing , and disappeared into the darkness . 
A few seconds later , they heard Mr . Diggory shout . 
" Yes ! 
We got them ! 
There's someone here ! 
It's - but - blimey . . 
" You ' ve got someone ? " shouted Mr . Crouch , sounding highly disbelieving . 
" Who ? 
Who is it ? " 
They heard snapping twigs , the rustling of leaves , and then crunching footsteps as Mr . Diggory reemerged from behind the trees . 
He was carrying a tiny , limp figure in his arms . 
Harry recognized the tea towel at once . 
It was Winky . 
Mr . Crouch did not move or speak as Mr . Diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet . 
For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed , his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky . 
Then he appeared to come to life again . 
" This - cannot - be , " he said jerkily . 
" No - " He moved quickly around Mr . Diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found Winky . 
" No point , Mr . Crouch , " Mr . Diggory called after him . 
" There's no one else there . " 
But Mr . Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it . 
They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside , searching . 
" Bit embarrassing , " Mr . Diggory said grimly , looking down at Winky's unconscious form . 
" Barty Crouch's house - elf . . . 
I mean to say ... " " Come off it , Amos , " said Mr . Weasley quietly , " you don't seriously think it was the elf ? 
The Dark Mark's a wizard's sign . 
" Yeah , " said Mr . Diggory , " and she had a wand . " 
" What ? " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Here , look . " 
Mr . Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr . Weasley . 
" Had it in her hand . 
So that's clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken , for a start . 
No non - human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand . " 
Just then there was another pop , and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr . Weasley . 
Looking breathless and disorientated , he spun on the spot , goggling upward at the emerald - green skull . 
" The Dark Mark ! " he panted , almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues . 
" Who did it ? 
Did you get them ? 
What's going on ? " 
Mr . Crouch had returned empty - handed . 
His face was still ghostly white , and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching . 
" Where have you been , Barty ? " said Bagman . 
" Why weren't you at the match ? 
Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet . 
" And my elf has been stunned . " 
By you lot , you mean ? 
But why - ? " Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman's round , shiny face ; he looked up at the skull , down at Winky , and then at Mr . Crouch . 
" No ! " he said . 
" Winky ? 
" I found her holding one , Ludo . 
Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr . Diggory , but Mr . Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent . 
He raised his own wand , pointed it at Winky , and said , " Ennervate ! " 
Winky stirred feebly . 
Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way . 
She caught sight of Mr . Diggory's feet , and slowly , tremulously , raised her eyes to stare up into his face ; then , more slowly still , she looked up into the sky . 
Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous , glassy eyes . 
" Elf ! " said Mr . Diggory sternly . 
" Do you know who I am ? 
I'm a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures ! " 
Winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground , her breath coming in sharp bursts . 
Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience . 
" And you were discovered moments later , right beneath it ! 
An explanation , if you please ! " " I - I - I is not doing it , sir ! " Winky gasped . 
And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above , Harry recognized it " Hey - that's mine ! " he said Everyone in the clearing looked at him . 
" Excuse me ? " said Mr . Diggory , incredulously . 
" That's my wand ! " said Harry . 
" I dropped it ! " 
" You dropped it ? " 
repeated Mr . Diggory in disbelief . 
" Is this a confession ? 
" Sorry . . . 
carried away . . 
" So , " said Mr . Diggory , his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again , cowering at his feet . 
" You found this wand , eh , elf ? 
And you picked it up and thought you'd have some fun with it , did you ? " " I is not doing magic with it , sir ! " squealed Winky , tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose . 
" I is . . . 
I is . . . 
I is just picking it up , sir ! i is not making the Dark Mark , sir , i is not knowing how ! " " It wasn't her ! " said Hermione . 
She looked very nervous , speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards , yet determined all the same . 
" Winky's got a squeaky little voice , and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper ! " 
She looked around at Harry and Ron , appealing for their support . 
" No , " said Harry , shaking his head . 
" There's a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed , elf , did you know that ? " Winky trembled and shook her head frantically , her ears flapping , as Mr . Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry's . 
" Prior Incantato ! " 
roared Mr . Diggory . 
Harry heard Hermione gasp , horrified , as a gigantic serpent - tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met , but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them ; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke : the ghost of a spell . 
" Deletrius ! " 
Mr . Diggory shouted , and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke . 
" So , " said Mr . Diggory with a kind of savage triumph , looking down upon Winky , who was still shaking convulsively . 
" I is not doing it ! " 
" I is not , I is not , I is not knowing how ! 
Mr . Diggory roared . 
" Caught with the guilty wand in your hand ! " " Amos , " said Mr . Weasley loudly , " think about it . . . 
precious few wizards know how to do that spell . . . . 
Amos Diggory looked horrified . 
" Mr . 
Crouch .. . 
not . . . 
not at all . 
" Harry Potter - and myself . 
" And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given , over a long career , that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them ? " 
Mr . Crouch shouted , his eyes bulging again . 
" Mr . 
Crouch , I - I never suggested you had anything to do with it ! " 
Amos Diggory muttered again , now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard . 
" If you accuse my elf , you accuse me , Diggory ! " shouted Mr . Crouch . 
" She - she might ' ve picked it up anywhere - " " Precisely , Amos , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" She might have picked it up anywhere .. . . 
Winky ? " he said kindly , turning to the elf , but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her . " Where exactly did you find Harry's wand ? " Winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers . 
" I - I is finding it . . . 
finding it there , sir . . . 
" You see , Amos ? " said Mr . Weasley . 
And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up . " 
Did you see anyone ? " Winky began to tremble worse than ever . 
Her giant eyes flickered from Mr . Diggory , to Ludo Bagman , and onto Mr . Crouch . 
no one . . 
" Amos , " said Mr . Crouch curtly , " I am fully aware that , in the ordinary course of events , you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning . 
I ask you , however , to allow me to deal with her . " 
Mr . Diggory looked as though he didn't think much of this suggestion at all , but it was clear to Harry that Mr . Crouch was such an important member of the Ministry that he did not dare refuse him . 
" You may rest assured that she will be punished , " Mr . Crouch added coldly . 
Winky stammered , looking up at Mr . Crouch , her eyes brimming with tears . 
Mr . Crouch stared back , his face somehow sharpened , each line upon it more deeply etched . 
" Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible , " he said slowly . 
" I told her to remain in the tent . 
I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble . 
And I find that she disobeyed me . 
This means clothes . " 
" No ! " shrieked Winky , prostrating herself at Mr . Crouch's feet . 
" No , master ! 
Not clothes , not clothes ! " 
Harry knew that the only way to turn a house - elf free was to present it with proper garments . 
Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing . 
Amos , that wand's told us all it can - if Harry could have it back , please - " Mr . Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it . 
" Come on , you three , " Mr . Weasley said quietly . 
But Hermione didn't seem to want to move ; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf . 
" Hermione ! " 
Mr . Weasley said , more urgently . 
She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees . 
" What's going to happen to Winky ? " said Hermione , the moment they had left the clearing . 
" I don't know , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" The way they were treating her ! " said Hermione furiously . 
" Mr . 
and Mr . Crouch ! 
" Well , she's not , " said Ron . Hermione rounded on him . 
It's disgusting the way - " " Hermione , I agree with you , " said Mr . Weasley quickly , beckoning her on , " but now is not the time to discuss elf rights . 
I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can . 
What happened to the others ? " 
" We lost them in the dark , " said Ron . " Dad , why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing ? " " I ' ll explain everything back at the tent , " said Mr . Weasley tensely . 
But when they reached the edge of the wood , their progress was impeded . 
A large crowd of frightened - looking witches and wizards was congregated there , and when they saw Mr . Weasley coming toward them , many of them surged forward . 
" What's going on in there ? " " Who conjured it ? " 
" Arthur - it's not - Him ? " " Of course it's not Him , " said Mr . Weasley impatiently . 
" We don't know who it was ; it looks like they Disapparated . 
Now excuse me , please , I want to get to bed . " 
He led Harry , Ron , and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite . 
Charlie's head was poking out of the boys ' tent . 
" Dad , what's going on ? " he called through the dark . 
" Fred , George , and Ginny got back okay , but the others - " " I ' ve got them here , " said Mr . Weasley , bending down and entering the tent . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione entered after him . 
Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table , holding a bedsheet to his arm , which was bleeding profusely . 
Charlie had a large rip in his shirt , and Percy was sporting a bloody nose . 
Fred , George , and Ginny looked unhurt , though shaken . 
" Did you get them , Dad ? " said Bill sharply . 
" The person who conjured the Mark ? " " No , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" We found Barry Crouch's elf holding Harry's wand , but we ' re none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark . " 
" What ? " said Bill , Charlie , and Percy together . 
" Harry's wand ? " said Fred . " Mr . 
Crouch's elf " said Percy , sounding thunderstruck . 
With some assistance from Harry , Ron , and Hermione , Mr . Weasley explained what had happened in the woods . 
" Well , Mr . Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that ! " he said . 
embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry . . . 
how would that have looked , if she'd been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control - " " She didn't do anything - she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time ! " Hermione snapped at Percy , who looked very taken aback . 
" Hermione , a wizard in Mr . Crouch's position can't afford a house - elf who's going to run amok with a wand ! " said Percy pompously , recovering himself . 
" She didn't run amok ! " shouted Hermione . 
" She just picked it up off the ground ! " 
" Look , can someone just explain what that skull thing was ? " said Ron impatiently . 
Why's it such a big deal ? " 
" I told you , it's You - Know - Who's symbol , Ron , " said Hermione , before anyone else could answer . 
" I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts . " " And it hasn't been seen for thirteen years , " said Mr . Weasley quietly . 
" I don't get it , " said Ron , frowning . 
" I mean . . . 
it's still only a shape in the sky . . . 
" Ron , You - Know - Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed , " said Mr . Weasley . 
you have no idea , you ' re too young . 
Mr . Weasley winced . 
" Everyone's worst fear . . . the very worst .. 
There was silence for a moment . 
Then Bill , removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut , said , " Well , it didn't help us tonight , whoever conjured it . 
It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it . 
We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground , though . 
" We can't prove it was them , Bill , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Yeah , I bet it was ! " said Ron suddenly . 
" Dad , we met Draco Malfoy in the woods , and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks ! 
Everybody flinched - like most of the wizarding world , the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort's name . 
" Sorry , " said Harry quickly . 
I mean , what was the point ? " 
" The point ? " said Mr . Weasley with a hollow laugh . 
" Harry , that's their idea of fun . 
" But if they were the Death Eaters , why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark ? " said Ron . " They'd have been pleased to see it , wouldn't they ? " " Use your brains , Ron , " said Bill . " If they really were Death Eaters , they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You - Know - Who lost power , and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people . 
" So . . . 
. " said Hermione slowly , " were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters , or to scare them away ? " " Your guess is as good as ours , Hermione , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" But I ' ll tell you this . . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it . 
I'd be very surprised if the person who did it hadn't been a Death Eater once , even if they ' re not now . . 
We ' ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here . " 
Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing . 
Three days ago - it felt like much longer , but it had only been three days - he had awoken with his scar burning . 
And tonight , for the first time in thirteen years , Lord Voldemort's mark had appeared in the sky . 
He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive . 
Harry lay looking up at the canvas , but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep , and it was a long time after Charlie's snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off . 
Mr . Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep . 
He used magic to pack up the tents , and they left the campsite as quickly as possible , passing Mr . Roberts at the door of his cottage . 
" He ' ll be all right , " said Mr . Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor . 
" Sometimes , when a person's memory's modified , it makes him a bit disorientated for a while ... and that was a big thing they had to make him forget . " 
They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay , and when they reached it , they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil , the keeper of the Portkeys , all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible . 
Mr . Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil ; they joined the queue , and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen . 
They walked back through Ottery St . Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light , talking very little because they were so exhausted , and thinking longingly of their breakfast . 
As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view , a cry echoed along the lane . 
" Oh thank goodness , thank goodness ! " 
Mrs . Weasley , who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard , came running toward them , still wearing her bedroom slippers , her face pale and strained , a rolled - up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand . 
" Arthur - I ' ve been so worried - so worried - " She flung her arms around Mr . Weasley's neck , and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground . 
Looking down , Harry saw the headline : SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP , complete with a twinkling black - and - white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops . 
Oh boys . . 
" Ouch ! 
Mum - you ' re strangling us - " " I shouted at you before you left ! " 
Mrs . Weasley said , starting to sob . 
What if You - Know - Who had got you , and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn't get enough OW . L . s ? Oh Fred . . . 
George . 
When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen , and Hermione had made Mrs . Weasley a cup of very strong tea , into which Mr . Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey , Bill handed his father the newspaper . 
Mr . Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder . 
" I knew it , " said Mr . Weasley heavily . 
Who wrote this ? 
Ah . . . of course . . . 
Rita Skeeter . " 
" That woman's got it in for the Ministry of Magic ! " said Percy furiously . 
" Last week she was saying we ' re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness , when we should be stamping out vampires ! 
As if it wasn't specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non - Wizard Part - Humans -- " " Do us a favor , Perce , " said Bill , yawning , " and shut up . " " I'm mentioned , " said Mr . Weasley , his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article . 
" Where ? " spluttered Mrs . Weasley , choking on her tea and whiskey . 
" If I'd seen that , I'd have known you were alive ! " " Not by name , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" Listen to this : ' If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic , they were sadly disappointed . 
Oh really , " said Mr . Weasley in exasperation , handing the paper to Percy . 
" Nobody was hurt . 
What was I supposed to say ? 
He heaved a deep sigh . 
" Molly , I'm going to have to go into the office ; this is going to take some smoothing over . " 
" I ' ll come with you , Father , " said Percy importantly . 
" Mr . 
He bustled out of the kitchen . 
Mrs . Weasley looked most upset . 
" I ' ve got to go , Molly , " said Mr . Weasley . 
I ' ll just change into my robes and I ' ll be off . . . 
. " " Mrs . 
Weasley , " said Harry suddenly , unable to contain himself , " Hedwig hasn't arrived with a letter for me , has she ? " " Hedwig , dear ? " said Mrs . Weasley distractedly . 
" No . . . 
no , there hasn't been any post at all . " Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry . 
think I will too , " said Ron at once . 
" Hermione ? " 
" Yes , " she said quickly , and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs . 
" What's up , Harry ? " said Ron , the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them . 
" There's something I haven't told you , " Harry said . 
" On Saturday morning , I woke up with my scar hurting again . " 
Ron's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive . 
Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once , mentioning a number of reference books , and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey , the Hogwarts nurse . 
Ron simply looked dumbstruck . 
" But - he wasn't there , was he ? You - Know - Who ? 
him and Peter - you know , Wormtail . 
I can't remember all of it now , but they were plotting to kill ... someone . " 
" It was only a dream , " said Ron bracingly . 
" Just a nightmare . " 
" Yeah , but was it , though ? " said Harry , turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky . 
" It's weird , isn't it ? . . . 
My scar hurts , and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march , and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again . " 
" Don't - say - his - name ! " Ron hissed through gritted teeth . 
" And remember what Professor Trelawney said ? " 
Harry went on , ignoring Ron . 
" At the end of last year ? " 
Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts . 
Hermione's terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort . 
" Oh Harry , you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says ? " " You weren't there , " said Harry . 
I told you , she went into a trance - a real one . 
and he'd manage it because his servant was going to go back to him . . . 
There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread . 
" Why were you asking if Hedwig had come , Harry ? " Hermione asked . 
" Are you expecting a letter ? " 
" I told Sirius about my scar , " said Harry , shrugging . 
" I'm waiting for his answer . " 
" Good thinking ! " said Ron , his expression clearing . 
" I bet Sirius ' ll know what to do ! " " I hoped he'd get back to me quickly , " said Harry . 
" But we don't know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or somewhere , couldn't he ? " said Hermione reasonably . 
" Hedwig's not going to manage that journey in a few days . " 
" Yeah , I know , " said Harry , but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig - free sky . 
" Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard , Harry " said Ron . " Come on three on three , Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play . 
He's worried , and he's tired . . . . 
We all need to go to bed ... " " Yeah , I want to play Quidditch , " said Harry suddenly . 
" Hang on , I ' ll get my Firebolt . " 
Hermione left the room , muttering something that sounded very much like " Boys . " 
Neither Mr . Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week . 
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up , and returned well after dinner every night . 
" Why are they all sending Howlers ? " asked Ginny , who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire . 
" Complaining about security at the World Cup , " said Percy . 
" They want compensation for their ruined property . 
Mundungus Fletcher's put in a claim for a twelve - bedroomed tent with en - suite Jacuzzi , but I ' ve got his number . 
I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks . " 
Mrs . Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner . 
Harry liked this clock . 
It had nine golden hands , and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family's names . 
" Home , " " school , " and " work " were there , but there was also " traveling , " " lost , " " hospital , " " prison , " and , in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock , " mortal peril . " 
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the " home " position , but Mr . Weasley's , which was the longest , was still pointing to " work . " 
Mrs . Weasley sighed . 
" Your father hasn't had to go into the office on weekends since the days of YouKnow - Who , " she said . 
His dinner's going to be ruined if he doesn't come home soon . " 
" If Dad hadn't said anything , old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented , " said Bill , who was playing chess with Ron . 
" Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good . 
Remember , she interviewed all the Gringotts ' Charm Breakers once , and called me ' a long - haired pillock ' ? " 
" Well , it is a bit long , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley gently . 
" If you'd just let me - " " No , Mum . " Rain lashed against the living room window . 
Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava . 
Harry was polishing his Firebolt , the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet . 
Fred and George were sitting in a far corner , quills out , talking in whispers , their heads bent over a piece of parchment . 
" What are you two up to ? " said Mrs . Weasley sharply , her eyes on the twins . 
" Homework , " said Fred vaguely . 
" Don't be ridiculous , you ' re still on holiday , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Now , Mum , " said Fred , looking up at her , a pained look on his face . 
" If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow , and George and I died , how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation ? " 
Everyone laughed , even Mrs . 
Weasley . 
Mr . Weasley's hand had suddenly spun from " work " to " traveling " ; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on " home " with the others , and they heard him calling from the kitchen . 
" Coming , Arthur ! " called Mrs . Weasley , hurrying out of the room . 
A few moments later , Mr . Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray . 
He looked completely exhausted . 
" Well , the fat's really in the fire now , " he told Mrs . Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower . 
" Rita Skeeter's been ferreting around all week , looking for more Ministry mess - ups to report . 
And now she's found out about poor old Bertha going missing , so that ' ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow . 
I told Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago . " 
" Mr . 
" There'd be a week's worth of headlines in his house - elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark . " " I thought we were all agreed that that elf , while irresponsible , did not conjure the Mark ? " said Percy hotly . 
" If you ask me , Mr . Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves ! " said Hermione angrily . 
" Now look here , Hermione ! " said Percy . 
" A high - ranking Ministry official like Mr . Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants - " 
" Come on now , all of you . . . 
Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit , put his Firebolt over his shoulder , and went back upstairs with Ron . 
The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house , accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind , not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic . 
The sight of the half - packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement . 
" Bung him some Owl Treats , " said Ron , throwing a packet across to Harry . 
Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon's cage , then turned to his trunk . 
Hedwig's cage stood next to it , still empty . 
" It's been over a week , " Harry said , looking at Hedwig's deserted perch . 
" Ron , you don't reckon Sirius has been caught , do you ? " 
. " " Look , here's the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley . 
He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry's camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it . 
Apart from The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 4 , by Miranda Goshawk , he had a handful of new quills , a dozen rolls of parchment , and refills for his potion - making kit - he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna . 
He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him . 
" What is that supposed to be ? " 
He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long , maroon velvet dress . 
There was a knock on the door , and Mrs . Weasley entered , carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes . 
" Of course I haven't , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" That's for you . 
" What ? " said Ron , looking horror - struck . 
" Dress robes ! " repeated Mrs . Weasley . 
" You ' ve got to be kidding , " said Ron in disbelief . 
" I'm not wearing that , no way . " 
" Everyone wears them , Ron ! " said Mrs . Weasley crossly . 
" They're all like that ! 
Your father's got some for smart parties ! " " I ' ll go starkers before I put that on , " said Ron stubbornly . 
" Don't be so silly , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" You ' ve got to have dress robes , they ' re on your list ! 
I got some for Harry too . . . 
show him , Harry ... . " 
In some trepidation , Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed . 
" I thought they'd bring out the color of your eyes , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley fondly . 
" Well , they ' re okay ! " said Ron angrily , looking at Harry's robes . 
Harry looked away . 
He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys , but he knew they would never take it . 
" Never . " 
" Fine , " snapped Mrs . Weasley . 
" Go naked . 
And , Harry , make sure you get a picture of him . 
She left the room , slamming the door behind her . 
There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them . 
" Why is everything I own rubbish ? " said Ron furiously , striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon's beak . 
There was a definite end - of - the - holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next morning . 
He , Ron , Fred , and George had just reached the first - floor landing on their way down to breakfast , when Mrs . Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs , looking harassed . 
" Arthur ! " she called up the staircase . 
" Arthur ! 
Urgent message from the Ministry ! " 
Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr . Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back - to - front and hurtled out of sight . 
When Harry and the others entered the kitchen , they saw Mrs . Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers " I ' ve got a quill here somewhere ! " - and Mr . Weasley bending over the fire , talking to Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly . 
Amos Diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large , bearded egg . 
It was talking very fast , completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears . 
Arthur , you ' ve got to get over there -- " " Here ! " said Mrs . Weasley breathlessly , pushing a piece of parchment , a bottle of ink , and a crumpled quill into Mr . Weasley's hands . 
" - it's a real stroke of luck I heard about it , " said Mr . Diggory's head . 
" I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls , and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one , Arthur -- " " What does Mad - Eye say happened ? " 
Mr . Diggory's head rolled its eyes . 
" Says he heard an intruder in his yard . 
Says he was creeping toward the house , but was ambushed by his dustbins . " 
" What did the dustbins do ? " asked Mr . Weasley , scribbling frantically . 
" Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere , as far as I can tell , " said Mr . Diggory . 
" And what about the intruder ? " 
" Arthur , you know Mad - Eye , " said Mr . Diggory's head , rolling its eyes again . 
" Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night ? 
" I ' ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window , " said Mr . Diggory , " but they ' ll have a job proving it , there aren't any casualties . " 
" All right , I'm off , " Mr . Weasley said , and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again . 
Mr . Diggory's head looked around at Mrs . Weasley . 
" Never mind , Amos , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Sure you won't have a bit of toast or anything before you go ? " " Oh go on , then , " said Mr . Diggory . 
Mrs . Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table , put it into the fire tongs , and transferred it into Mr . Diggory's mouth . 
" Fanks , " he said in a muffled voice , and then , with a small pop , vanished . 
Harry could hear Mr . Weasley calling hurried good - byes to Bill , Charlie , Percy , and the girls . 
Within five minutes , he was back in the kitchen , his robes on the right way now , dragging a comb through his hair . 
" I'd better hurry - you have a good term , boys , said Mr . Weasley to Harry , Ron , and the twins , fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate . 
" Molly , are you going to be all right taking the kids to King's Cross ? " " Of course I will , " she said . 
" You just look after Mad - Eye , we ' ll be fine . " 
As Mr . Weasley vanished , Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen . 
" Did someone say Mad - Eye ? " Bill asked . 
" What's he been up to now . " " He says someone tried to break into his house last night , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Mad - Eye Moody ? " said George thoughtfully , spreading marmalade on his toast . 
" Birds of a feather . . 
. " " Moody was a great wizard in his time , " said Bill . " He's an old friend of Dumbledore's , isn't he ? " said Charlie . 
" Dumbledore's not what you'd call normal , though , is he ? " said Fred . " I mean , I know he's a genius and everything .. . " 
" Who is Mad - Eye ? " asked Harry . 
" He's retired , used to work at the Ministry , " said Charlie . 
He was an Auror - one of the best . . . 
Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King's Cross station , but Percy , apologizing most profusely , said that he really needed to get to work . 
" Mr . 
Crouch is really starting to rely on me . " " Yeah , you know what , Percy ? " said George seriously . 
Mrs . Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London . 
" Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us , " Mrs . Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain - washed yard , watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars . 
Oh dear , they don't look happy , do they ? " 
Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster's Fabulous No - Heat , Wet - Start Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred's trunk sprang open , causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man's leg . 
The journey was uncomfortable , owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks . 
Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks , and by the time they entered London , Harry , Ron , and Hermione were all severely scratched . 
They were very relieved to get out at King's Cross , even though the rain was coming down harder than ever , and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station . 
It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten . 
They did it in groups today ; Harry , Ron , and Hermione ( the most conspicuous , since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks ) went first ; they leaned casually against the barrier , chatting unconcernedly , and slid sideways through it . . . 
The Hogwarts Express , a gleaming scarlet steam engine , was already there , clouds of steam billowing from it , through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts . 
Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione set off to find seats , and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train . 
They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good - bye to Mrs . Weasley , Bill , and Charlie . 
" Why ? " said Fred keenly . 
" You ' ll see , " said Charlie . 
it's ' classified information , until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it , ' after all . " 
" Why ? " said George impatiently . 
" A bit of what ? " said Ron . 
But at that moment , the whistle blew , and Mrs . Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors . 
" Thanks for having us to stay , Mrs . Weasley , " said Hermione as they climbed on board , closed the door , and leaned out of the window to talk to her . " Yeah , thanks for everything , Mrs . Weasley , " said Harry . 
" Oh it was my pleasure , dears , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" I'd invite you for Christmas , but ... well , I expect you ' re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts , what with . . . 
" Mum ! " said Ron irritably . 
" What d ' you three know that we don't ? " 
" You ' ll find out this evening , I expect , " said Mrs . Weasley , smiling . 
" I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you . . . . 
Now , behave , won't you ? 
And you , George ? " 
The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move . 
" Tell us what's happening at Hogwarts ! " Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs . Weasley , Bill , and Charlie sped away from them . 
" What rules are they changing ? " 
But Mrs . Weasley only smiled and waved . 
Before the train had rounded the corner , she , Bill , and Charlie had Disapparated . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione went back to their compartment . 
The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them . 
Ron undid his trunk , pulled out his maroon dress robes , and flung them over Pigwidgeon's cage to muffle his hooting . 
" Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts , " he said grumpily , sitting down next to Harry . 
" At the World Cup , remember ? 
Wonder what -- " " Shh ! " Hermione whispered suddenly , pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs . 
Harry and Ron listened , and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door . 
But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to school so far away . 
Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts . 
Durmstrang students actually learn them , not just the defense rubbish we do . . . 
Hermione got up , tiptoed to the compartment door , and slid it shut , blocking out Malfoy's voice . 
" Durmstrang's another wizarding school ? " said Harry . 
" Yes , " said Hermione sniffily , " and it's got a horrible reputation . 
According to An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe , it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts . " 
" I think I ' ve heard of it , " said Ron vaguely . 
" Where is it ? 
What country ? " " Well , nobody knows , do they ? " said Hermione , raising her eyebrows . 
" Er - why not ? " said Harry . 
" Come off it , " said Ron , starting to laugh . 
" Durmstrang's got to be about the same size as Hogwarts -- how are you going to hide a great big castle ? " 
" But Hogwarts is hidden , " said Hermione , in surprise . 
" Everyone knows that .. . 
well , everyone who's read Hogwarts , A History , anyway . " 
" If a Muggle looks at it , all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER , DO NOT ENTER , UNSAFE . " 
And to keep foreign wizards from finding it , they ' ll have made it Unplottable - " " Come again ? " " Well , you can enchant a building so it's impossible to plot on a map , can't you ? " " Er . . . 
if you say so , " said Harry . 
" But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north , " said Hermione thoughtfully . 
" Ah , think of the possibilities , " said Ron dreamily . 
" It would ' ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident ... . 
The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north . 
The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday . 
The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor , and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share . 
Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed , including Seamus Finnigan , Dean Thomas , and Neville Longbottom , a round - faced , extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother . 
Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now ; it was still squeaking " Troy - Mullet - Moran ! " but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way . 
After half an hour or so , Hermione , growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk , buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 4 , and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm . 
Neville listened jealously to the others ' conversation as they relived the Cup match . 
" Wouldn't buy tickets . 
" It was , " said Ron . " Look at this , Neville . . . 
He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum . 
" We saw him right up close , as well , " said Ron . " We were in the Top Box - " " For the first and last time in your life , Weasley . " 
Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway . 
Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle , his enormous , thuggish cronies , both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer . 
Evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door , which Dean and Seamus had left ajar . 
" Weasley . . . 
A sleeve of Ron's dress robes was dangling from it , swaying with the motion of the train , the moldy lace cuff very obvious . 
Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight , but Malfoy was too quick for him ; he seized the sleeve and pulled . 
" Eat dung , Malfoy ! " said Ron , the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy's grip . 
" So . . . 
going to enter , Weasley ? 
Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name ? 
you'd be able to afford some decent robes if you won . . . 
. " " What are you talking about ? " snapped Ron . 
' Are you going to enter ? ' Malfoy repeated . 
" I suppose you will , Potter ? 
" You ' ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you don't even know ? 
heard it from Cornelius Fudge . 
But then , Father's always associated with the top people at the Ministry . . . . 
Maybe your father's too junior to know about it , Weasley . . . 
yes . . . 
Laughing once more , Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle , and the three of them disappeared . 
Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered . 
" Ron ! " said Hermione reproachfully , and she pulled out her wand , muttered " Reparo ! " and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door . 
" Well .. . 
Ron snarled . 
" Father's always associated with the top peopie at the Ministry . ' . . . 
. " " Of course he does , " said Hermione quietly . 
Get to me ! ? 
As if ! " said Ron , picking up one of the remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp . 
Ron's bad mood continued for the rest of the journey . 
He didn't talk much as they changed into their school robes , and was still glowering when the Hogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch - darkness of Hogsmeade station . 
As the train doors opened , there was a rumble of thunder overhead . 
Hermione bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train , heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour . 
" Hi , Hagrid ! " 
Harry yelled , seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform . 
" Oooh , I wouldn't fancy crossing the lake in this weather , " said Hermione fervently , shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them , the door shut with a snap , and a few moments later , with a great lurch , the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle . 
Through the gates , flanked with statues of winged boars , and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled , swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale . 
Leaning against the window , Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer , its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain . 
Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors , which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps . 
People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too , looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous , torch - lit entrance hall , with its magnificent marble staircase . 
I'm soak - ARRGH ! " A large , red , water - filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron's head and exploded . 
Drenched and sputtering , Ron staggered sideways into Harry , just as a second water bomb dropped - narrowly missing Hermione , it burst at Harry's feet , sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks . 
Harry looked up and saw , floating twenty feet above them , Peeves the Poltergeist , a little man in a bell - covered hat and orange bow tie , his wide , malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again . 
" Peeves , come down here at ONCE ! " Professor McGonagall , Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House , had come dashing out of the Great Hall ; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling . 
" Ouch - sorry , Miss Granger - " " That's all right , Professor ! " 
Hermione gasped , massaging her throat . 
And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived . 
" I shall call the headmaster ! " shouted Professor McGonagall . 
" I'm warning you , Peeves - " Peeves stuck out his tongue , threw the last of his water bombs into the air , and zoomed off up the marble staircase , cackling insanely . 
" Into the Great Hall , come on ! " 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right , Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face . 
Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles , floating over the tables in midair . 
The four long House tables were packed with chattering students ; at the top of the Hall , the staff sat along one side of a fifth table , facing their pupils . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione walked past the Slytherins , the Ravenclaws , and the Hufflepuffs , and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall , next to Nearly Headless Nick , the Gryffindor ghost . 
Pearly white and semitransparent , Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet , but with a particularly large ruff , which served the dual purpose of looking extra - festive , and insuring that his head didn't wobble too much on his partially severed neck . 
" Says who ? " said Harry , taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water . 
I'm starving . " 
The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year , but by an unlucky combination of circumstances , Harry hadn't been present at one since his own . 
He was quite looking forward to it . 
Just then , a highly excited , breathless voice called down the table . 
" Hiya , Harry ! " 
It was Colin Creevey , a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero . 
" Hi , Colin , " said Harry warily . 
" Harry , guess what ? 
Guess what , Harry ? 
My brother Dennis ! " " Er - good , " said Harry . 
" I just hope he's in Gryffindor ! 
Keep your fingers crossed , eh , Harry ? " " Er - yeah , all right , " said Harry . 
He turned back to Hermione , Ron , and Nearly Headless Nick . 
" Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses , don't they ? " he said . 
" Oh no , not necessarily , " said Hermione . 
Harry looked up at the staff table . 
There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual . 
Hagrid , of course , was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years ; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor , but there was another empty chair too , and Harry couldn't think who else was missing . 
" Where's the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? " said Hermione , who was also looking up at the teachers . 
He looked up and down the staff table . 
There was definitely no new face there . 
Harry scanned the table more carefully . 
She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department . 
Harry's loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape's hatred of him , a hatred which had , if possible , intensified last year , when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape's overlarge nose - Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days . 
On Snape's other side was an empty seat , which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall's . 
Next to it , and in the very center of the table , sat Professor Dumbledore , the headmaster , his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight , his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons . 
The tips of Dumbledore's long , thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them , staring up at the ceiling through his half - moon spectacles as though lost in thought . 
Harry glanced up at the ceiling too . 
It was enchanted to look like the sky outside , and he had never seen it look this stormy . 
" Oh hurry up , " Ron moaned , beside Harry , " I could eat a hippogriff . " 
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell . 
Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall . 
If Harry , Ron , and Hermione were wet , it was nothing to how these first years looked . 
They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed . 
All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school - all of them except the smallest of the lot , a boy with mousy hair , who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid's moleskin overcoat . 
He looked positively delighted about it . 
Professor McGonagall now placed a three - legged stool on the ground before the first years and , on top of it , an extremely old , dirty patched wizard's hat . 
So did everyone else . 
For a moment , there was silence . 
They shared a wish , a hope , a dream , They hatched a daring plan To educate young sorcerers Thus Hogwarts School began . 
By Gryffindor , the bravest were Prized far beyond the rest ; For Ravenclaw , the cleverest Would always be the best ; For Hufflepuff , hard workers were Most worthy of admission ; 
While still alive they did divide Their favorites from the throng , Yet how to pick the worthy ones When they were dead and gone ? 
" That's not the song it sang when it Sorted us , " said Harry , clapping along with everyone else . 
" Sings a different one every year , " said Ron . " It's got to be a pretty boring life , hasn't it , being a hat ? 
Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment . 
" When I call out your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool , " she told the first years . 
" When the hat announces your House , you will go and sit at the appropriate table . 
" Ackerley , Stewart ! " 
A boy walked forward , visibly trembling from head to foot , picked up the Sorting Hat , put it on , and sat down on the stool . 
" RAVENCLAW ! " shouted the hat . 
Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table , where everyone was applauding him . 
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho , the Ravenclaw Seeker , cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down . 
For a fleeting second , Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too . 
" Baddock , Malcolm ! " " SLYTHERIN ! " 
The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers ; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins . 
Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down . 
" Branstone , Eleanor ! " " HUFFLEPUFF ! " 
" Cauldwell , Owen ! " " HUFFLEPUFF ! " 
" Creevey , Dennis ! " Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward , tripping over Hagrid's moleskin , just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers ' table . 
About twice as tall as a normal man , and at least three times as broad , Hagrid , with his long , wild , tangled black hair and beard , looked slightly alarming - a misleading impression , for Harry , Ron , and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature . 
He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat . 
The rip at the brim opened wide -- " GRYFFINDOR ! " the hat shouted . 
Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey , beaming widely , took off the hat , placed it back on the stool , and hurried over to join his brother . 
" Colin , I fell in ! " he said shrilly , throwing himself into an empty seat . 
" It was brilliant ! 
And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat ! " " Cool ! " said Colin , just as excitedly . 
" It was probably the giant squid , Dennis ! " " Wow ! " said Dennis , as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm - tossed , fathoms - deep lake , and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster . 
" Dennis ! 
Dennis ! 
The one with the black hair and glasses ? 
See him ? 
Know who he is , Dennis ? " 
The Sorting continued ; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the three - legged stool , the line dwindling slowly as 
Professor McGonagall passed the L's . 
" Oh hurry up , " Ron moaned , massaging his stomach . 
" I do hope this year's batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch , " said Nearly Headless Nick , applauding as " McDonald , Natalie ! " joined the Gryffindor table . 
" We don't want to break our winning streak , do we ? " Gryffindor had won the Inter - House Championship for the last three years in a row . 
" Pritchard , Graham ! " " SLYTHERIN ! " " Quirke , Orla ! " " RAVENCLAW ! " 
And finally , with " Whitby , Kevin ! " ( " HUFFLEPUFF ! " ) , the Sorting ended . 
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away . 
" About time , " said Ron , seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate . 
He was smiling around at the students , his arms opened wide in welcome . 
" I have only two words to say to you , " he told them , his deep voice echoing around the Hall . 
" Tuck in . " " Hear , hear ! " said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes . 
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry , Ron , and Hermione loaded their own plates . 
" There was trouble in the kitchens earlier . " 
" Why ? 
" Peeves , of course , " said Nearly Headless Nick , shaking his head , which wobbled dangerously . 
He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck . 
" The usual argument , you know . 
He wanted to attend the feast - well , it's quite out of the question , you know what he's like , utterly uncivilized , can't see a plate of food without throwing it . 
We held a ghost's council - the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance - but most wisely , in my opinion , the Bloody Baron put his foot down . " 
The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost , a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains . 
He was the only person at Hogwarts who could really control Peeves . 
" So what did he do in the kitchens ? " 
Terrified the houseelves out of their wits -- " Clang . 
" There are house - elves here ? " 
" Here at Hogwarts ? " " Certainly , " said Nearly Headless Nick , looking surprised at her reaction . 
" The largest number in any dwelling in Britain , I believe . 
Over a hundred . " 
" I ' ve never seen one ! " said Hermione . 
" They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning .. . 
see to the fires and so on .. . . 
I mean , you ' re not supposed to see them , are you ? 
That's the mark of a good house - elf , isn't it , that you don't know it's there ? " 
Hermione stared at him . 
" But they get paid ? " 
she said . 
And - and sick leave , and pensions , and everything ? " 
Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off , dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck . 
" Sick leave and pensions ? " he said , pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff . 
" Slave labor , " said Hermione , breathing hard through her nose . 
" That's what made this dinner . 
Slave labor . " 
The rain was still drumming heavily against the high , dark glass . 
Another clap of thunder shook the windows , and the stormy ceiling flashed , illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced , instantly , with puddings . 
" Treacle tart , Hermione ! " said Ron , deliberately wafting its smell toward her . 
But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he gave up . 
When the puddings too had been demolished , and the last crumbs had faded off the plates , leaving them sparkling clean , Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again . 
" So ! " said Dumbledore , smiling around at them all . 
" Mr . 
Filch , the caretaker , has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo - yos , Fanged Frisbees , and Ever - Bashing Boomerangs . 
The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty - seven items , I believe , and can be viewed in Mr . Filch's office , if anybody would like to check it . " 
The corners of Dumbledore's mouth twitched . 
He continued , " As ever , I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out - of - bounds to students , as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year . 
" It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter - House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year . " 
" What ? " 
Harry gasped . 
He looked around at Fred and George , his fellow members of the Quidditch team . 
Dumbhedore went on , " This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers ' time and energy - but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely . 
I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts - " But at that moment , there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open . 
A man stood in the doorway , leaning upon a long staff , shrouded in a black traveling cloak . 
Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger , suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling . 
He reached the end of the top table , turned right , and limped heavily toward Dumbledore . 
Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling . 
Hermione gasped . 
The lightning had thrown the man's face into sharp relief , and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen . 
The mouth looked like a diagonal gash , and a large chunk of the nose was missing . 
But it was the man's eyes that made him frightening . 
One of them was small , dark , and beady . 
The blue eye was moving ceaselessly , without blinking , and was rolling up , down , and from side to side , quite independently of the normal eye - and then it rolled right over , pointing into the back of the man's head , so that all they could see was whiteness . 
The stranger reached Dumbledore . 
He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face , and Dumbhedore shook it , muttering words Harry couldn't hear . 
Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right - hand side . 
The stranger sat down , shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face , pulled a plate of sausages toward him , raised it to what was left of his nose , and sniffed it . 
He then took a small knife out of his pocket , speared a sausage on the end of it , and began to eat . 
His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages , but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket , taking in the Hall and the students . 
" May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? " said Dumbledore brightly into the silence . 
" Professor Moody . " 
It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause , but none of the staff or students chapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid , who both put their hands together and applauded , but the sound echoed dismally into the silence , and they stopped fairly quickly . 
Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody's bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him . 
" Moody ? " 
Harry muttered to Ron . " Mad - Eye Moody ? 
" Must be , " said Ron in a low , awed voice . 
" What happened to him ? " 
Hermione whispered . 
Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him , he reached again into his traveling cloak , pulled out a hip flask , and took a long draught from it . 
As he lifted his arm to drink , his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground , and Harry saw , below the table , several inches of carved wooden leg , ending in a clawed foot . 
Dumbledore cleared his throat . 
" As I was saying , " he said , smiling at the sea of students before him , all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad - Eye Moody , " we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months , an event that has not been held for over a century . 
It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year . " 
" You ' re JOKING ! " said Fred Weasley loudly . 
The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody's arrival suddenly broke . 
" I am not joking , Mr . Weasley , " he said , " though now that you mention it , I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll , a hag , and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . 
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly . 
" Er - but maybe this is not the time .. . 
no . . 
well , some of you will not know what this tournament involves , so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation , and allow their attention to wander freely . 
" The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry : Hogwarts , Beauxbatons , and Durmstrang . 
A champion was selected to represent each school , and the three champions competed in three magical tasks . 
The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years , and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities - until , that is , the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued . " 
" Death toll ? " Hermione whispered , looking alarmed . 
But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall ; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another , and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago . 
" There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament , " 
Dumbledore continued , " none of which has been very successful . 
However , our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt . 
We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time , no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger . 
" The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short - listed contenders in October , and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween . 
An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup , the glory of their school , and a thousand Galleons personal prize money . " 
" I'm going for it ! " 
Fred Weasley hissed down the table , his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches . 
He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion . 
At every House table , Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore , or else whispering fervently to their neighbors . 
But then Dumbledore spoke again , and the Hall quieted once more . 
" Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts , " he said , " the heads of the participating schools , along with the Ministry of Magic , have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year . 
Only students who are of age - that is to say , seventeen years or older - will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration . 
This " -- Dumbledore raised his voice slightly , for several people had made noises of outrage at these words , and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious - " is a measure we feel is necessary , given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous , whatever precautions we take , and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them . 
His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred's and George's mutinous faces . 
" I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen . 
" The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year . 
I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us , and will give your whole - hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected . 
And now , it is late , and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning . 
Chop chop ! " Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad - Eye Moody . 
There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall . 
" They can't do that ! " said George Weasley , who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door , but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore . 
" The champions ' ll get to do all sorts of stuff you'd never be allowed to do normally . 
And a thousand Galleons prize money ! " " Yeah , " said Ron , a faraway look on his face . 
" Yeah , a thousand Galleons . . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred , and George set off for the entrance hall , Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament . 
" Dumbledore knows you ' re not of age , though , " said Ron . " Yeah , but he's not the one who decides who the champion is , is he ? " said Fred shrewdly . 
" Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter , he ' ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are . 
Dumbledore's trying to stop us giving our names . " 
Hey , Ron , what if we find out how to get ' round Dumbledore ? 
" What d ' you reckon ? " 
Ron asked Harry . 
" I definitely haven't , " came Nevihle's gloomy voice from behind Fred and George . 
I ' ll just have to -- oops . . 
Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out , while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked , laughing wheezily . 
They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower , which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress . 
" Password ? " she said as they approached . 
" Balderdash , " said George , " a prefect downstairs told me . " 
The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed . 
A crackling fire warmed the circular common room , which was full of squashy armchairs and tables . 
Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look , and Harry distinctly heard her mutter " Slave labor " before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls'dormitory . 
Harry , Ron , and Neville climbed up the last , spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory , which was situated at the top of the tower . 
Five four - poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls , each with its owner's trunk at the foot . 
Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed ; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard , and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table . 
His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it . 
" Mental , " Ron sighed , shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players . 
Harry , Ron , and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed . 
It was extremely comfortable , lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside . 
" I might go in for it , you know , " Ron said sleepily through the darkness , " if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . 
you never know , do you ? " 
He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the grounds , his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school , all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament . 
The storm had blown itself out by the following morning , though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy ; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as Harry , Ron , and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast . 
A few seats along , Fred , George , and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament . 
" Today's not bad .. . 
outside all morning , " said Ron , who was running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule . 
" Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures ... damn it , we ' re still with the Slytherins . . . 
" Yeah . . . 
and you were hungry , " said Ron , grinning . 
There was a sudden rustling noise above them , and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail . 
Instinctively , Harry looked up , but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray . 
The owls circled the tables , looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed . 
A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap - Neville almost always forgot to pack something . 
On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy's eagle owl had landed on his shoulder , carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home . 
Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach , Harry returned to his porridge . 
His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three , but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen . 
" Bubotubers , " Professor Sprout told them briskly . 
You will collect the pus - " " The what ? " said Seamus Finnigan , sounding revolted . 
" Pus , Finnigan , pus , " said Professor Sprout , " and it's extremely valuable , so don't waste it . 
You will collect the pus , I say , in these bottles . 
They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated , and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints . 
" This ' ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy , " said Professor Sprout , stoppering the last bottle with a cork . 
" Like poor Eloise Midgen , " said Hannah Abbott , a Hufflepuff , in a hushed voice . 
" Silly girl , " said Professor Sprout , shaking her head . 
" But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end . " 
A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds , signaling the end of the lesson , and the class separated ; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration , and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction , down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid's small wooden cabin , which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
Hagrid was standing outside his hut , one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound , Fang . 
There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet , and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar , apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely . 
Hagrid said , grinning at Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
They looked like deformed , shell - less lobsters , horribly pale and slimy - looking , with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads . 
There were about a hundred of them in each crate , each about six inches long , crawling over one another , bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes . 
Every now and then , sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt , and with a small phut , it would be propelled forward several inches . 
Thought we'd make a bit of a project of it ! " 
The Slytherins had arrived . 
The speaker was Draco Malfoy . 
Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words . 
Hagrid looked stumped at the question . 
" I mean , what do they do ? " asked Malfoy . 
" What is the point of them ? " Hagrid opened his mouth , apparently thinking hard ; there was a few seconds ' pause , then he said roughly , " Tha's next lesson , Malfoy . 
" First pus and now this , " muttered Seamus . 
Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry , Ron , and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast - Ended Skrewts . 
Harry couldn't suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless , because the skrewts didn't seem to have mouths . 
" Ouch ! " yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes . 
" It got me . " 
" Its end exploded ! " said Dean angrily , showing Hagrid a burn on his hand . 
" Eurgh ! " said Lavender Brown again . 
" Eurgh , Hagrid , what's that pointy thing on it ? " 
" Well , I can certainly see why we ' re trying to keep them alive , " said Malfoy sarcastically . 
" Dragon blood's amazingly magical , but you wouldn't want a dragon for a pet , would you ? " 
Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid , who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard . 
Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon , as Harry , Ron , and Hermione knew only too well - he had owned one for a brief period during their first year , a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert . 
Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures , the more lethal , the better . 
" Well , at least the skrewts are small , " said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later . 
" They are now , " said Hermione in an exasperated voice , " but once Hagrid's found out what they eat , I expect they ' ll be six feet long . " 
" Well , that won't matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something , will it ? " 
said Ron , grinning slyly at her . " You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up , " said Hermione . 
The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all . " 
They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes . 
Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her . " Er - is this the new stand on elf rights ? " said Ron . " You ' re going to make yourself puke instead ? " " No , " said Hermione , with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts . 
" I just want to get to the library . " 
" What ? " said Ron in disbelief . 
" Hermione - it's the first day back ! 
We haven't even got homework yet ! " Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days . 
When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons , Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where , at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase , a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling , and the room where Professor Trelawney lived . 
The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder . 
As ever , the curtains were all closed ; the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps , which were all draped with scarves and shawls . 
Harry and Ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room , and sat down at the same small circular table . 
A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face , Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him . 
The usual large amount of beads , chains , and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight . 
" You are preoccupied , my dear , " she said mournfully to Harry . 
And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless . 
I see difficult times ahead for you , alas . . . 
I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . . 
and perhaps sooner than you think ... " Her voice dropped almost to a whisper . 
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry , who looked stonily back . 
Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire , facing the class . 
Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil , who deeply admired Professor Trelawney , were sitting on poufs very close to her . " My dears , it is time for us to consider the stars , " she said . 
" The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance . 
But Harry's thoughts had drifted . 
" I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... ' " But Hermione was right , Harry thought irritably , Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud . 
He wasn't dreading anything at the moment at all . . . 
but what did Professor Trelawney know ? 
He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner . 
Except , of course , for that time at the end of last term , when she had made the prediction about Voldemort rising again . . . 
and Dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine , when Harry had described it to him . 
" Harry ! " 
Ron muttered . 
" What ? " 
Harry looked around ; the whole class was staring at him . 
" I was saying , my dear , that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn , " said Professor Trelawney , a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words . 
" Born under - what , sorry ? " said Harry . 
" I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth . . . . 
I think I am right in saying , my dear , that you were born in midwinter ? " 
" No , " said Harry , " I was born in July . " 
Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough . 
Half an hour later , each of them had been given a complicated circular chart , and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth . 
" I ' ve got two Neptunes here , " said Harry after a while , frowning down at his piece of parchment , " that can't be right , can it ? " 
" Aaaaah , " said Ron , imitating Professor Trelawney's mystical whisper , " when two Neptunes appear in the sky , it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born , Harry . . . 
I think I ' ve got an unaspected planet ! 
Oooh , which one's that , Professor ? " 
" It is Uranus , my dear , " said Professor Trelawney , peering down at the chart . 
" Can I have a look at Uranus too , Lavender ? " said Ron . 
Most unfortunately , Professor Trelawney heard him , and it was this , perhaps , that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class . 
" A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you , with reference to your personal chart , " she snapped , sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy - fairy self . 
" I want it ready to hand in next Monday , and no excuses ! " 
" Miserable old bat , " said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner . 
" That ' ll take all weekend , that will . . 
. " " Lots of homework ? " said Hermione brightly , catching up with them . 
They reached the entrance hall , which was packed with people queuing for dinner . 
They had just joined the end of the line , when a loud voice rang out behind them . 
" Weasley ! 
Hey , Weasley ! " Harry , Ron , and Hermione turned . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were standing there , each looking thoroughly pleased about something . 
" What ? " said Ron shortly . 
" Your dad's in the paper , Weasley ! " said Malfoy , brandishing a copy of the Daily Prophet and speaking very loudly , so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear . 
" Listen to this ! FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC It seems as though the Ministry of Magic's troubles are not yet at an end , writes Rita Skeeter , Special Correspondent . 
Recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup , and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches , the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley , of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office . " 
Malfoy looked up . 
It's almost as though he's a complete nonentity , isn't it ? " he crowed . 
Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now . 
Malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on : Arnold Weasley , who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago , was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law - keepers ( " policemen " ) over a number of highly aggressive dustbins . 
Mr . Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of " Mad - Eye " Moody , the aged ex - Auror who retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder . 
Unsurprisingly , Mr . Weasley found , upon arrival at Mr . Moody's heavily guarded house , that Mr . Moody had once again raised a false alarm . 
Mr . Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen , but refused to answer Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene . 
" And there's a picture , Weasley ! " said Malfoy , flipping the paper over and holding it up . 
" A picture of your parents outside their house - if you can call it a house ! 
Everyone was staring at him . 
" Get stuffed , Malfoy , " said Harry . 
" C ' mon , Ron . . 
. " " Oh yeah , you were staying with them this summer , weren't you , Potter ? " sneered Malfoy . 
" So tell me , is his mother really that porky , or is it just the picture ? " " You know your mother , Malfoy ? " said Harry - both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron's robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy 
Has she always looked like that , or was it just because you were with her ? " Malfoy's pale face went slightly pink . 
BANG ! 
Several people screamed - Harry felt something white - hot graze the side of his face - he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand , but before he'd even touched it , he heard a second loud BANG , and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall . 
" OH NO YOU DON ' T , LADDIE ! " 
Harry spun around . 
Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase . 
His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret , which was shivering on the stone - flagged floor , exactly where Malfoy had been standing . 
There was a terrified silence in the entrance hall . 
Moody turned to look at Harry -- at least , his normal eye was looking at Harry ; the other one was pointing into the back of his head . 
" Did he get you ? " 
Moody growled . 
His voice was low and gravelly . 
" No , " said Harry , " missed . " 
" LEAVE IT ! " Moody shouted . 
" Leave - what ? " Harry said , bewildered . 
" Not you - him ! " Moody growled , jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe , who had just frozen , about to pick up the white ferret . 
It seemed that Moody's rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head . 
Moody started to limp toward Crabbe , Goyle , and the ferret , which gave a terrified squeak and took off , streaking toward the dungeons . 
" I don't think so ! " roared Moody , pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew ten feet into the air , fell with a smack to the floor , and then bounced upward once more . 
" I don't like people who attack when their opponent's back's turned , " growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher , squealing in pain . 
" Stinking , cowardly , scummy thing to do ... " The ferret flew through the air , its legs and tail flailing helplessly . 
" Never - do - that - again - " said Moody , speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again . 
" Professor Moody ! " said a shocked voice . 
Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books . 
" Hello , Professor McGonagall , " said Moody calmly , bouncing the ferret still higher . 
" What - what are you doing ? " said Professor McGonagall , her eyes following the bouncing ferret's progress through the air . 
" Teaching , " said Moody . 
" Teach - Moody , is that a student ? " shrieked Professor McGonagall , the books spilling out of her arms . 
" Yep , " said Moody . 
" No ! " cried Professor McGonagall , running down the stairs and pulling out her wand ; a moment later , with a loud snapping noise , Draco Malfoy had reappeared , lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face . 
He got to his feet , wincing . 
" Oh yeah ? " said Moody quietly , limping forward a few steps , the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall . 
you tell him that from me . . . . 
" Yes , " said Malfoy resentfully . 
" Another old friend , " growled Moody . 
Come on , you . . 
And he seized Malfoy's upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons . 
Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments , then waved her wand at her fallen books , causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms . 
" Don't talk to me , " Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later , surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened . 
" Why not ? " said Hermione in surprise . 
" Because I want to fix that in my memory forever , " said Ron , his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face . 
" Draco Malfoy , the amazing bouncing ferret . " 
Harry and Hermione both laughed , and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates . 
" He could have really hurt Malfoy , though , " she said . 
" Don't tell me you ' re going back to the library this evening ? " said Harry , watching her . 
" Got to , " said Hermione thickly . 
" Loads to do . " " But you told us Professor Vector - " " It's not schoolwork , " she said . 
Within five minutes , she had cleared her plate and departed . 
" Moody ! " he said . 
" How cool is he ? " " Beyond cool , " said George , sitting down opposite Fred . 
" Supercool , " said the twins ' best friend , Lee Jordan , sliding into the seat beside George . 
" We had him this afternoon , " he told Harry and Ron . 
" What was it like ? " said Harry eagerly . 
Fred , George , and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning . 
" Never had a lesson like it , " said Fred . " He knows , man , " said Lee . " Knows what ? " said Ron , leaning forward . 
" Knows what it's like to be out there doing it , " said George impressively . 
" Doing what ? " said Harry . 
" Fighting the Dark Arts , " said Fred . " He's seen it all , " said George . 
" Mazing , " said Lee . Ron dived into his bag for his schedule . 
" We haven't got him till Thursday ! " he said in a disappointed voice . 
Professor Snape , who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer , gave Nevihle detention , and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse , having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads . 
" You know why Snape's in such a foul mood , don't you ? " said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Moody . " 
It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job , and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running . 
Indeed , whenever Harry saw the two of them together - at mealtimes , or when they passed in the corridors - he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody's eye , whether magical or normal . 
The only person missing was Hermione , who turned up just in time for the lesson . 
" Been in the - " " Library . " 
Harry finished her sentence for her . 
They hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher's desk , took out their copies of The Dark Forces : A Guide to Self - Protection , and waited , unusually quiet . 
Soon they heard Moody's distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor , and he entered the room , looking as strange and frightening as ever . 
Moody took out a register , shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face , and began to call out names , his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around , fixing upon each student as he or she answered . 
" Right then , " he said , when the last person had declared themselves present , " I ' ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class . 
There was a general murmur of assent . 
" But you ' re behind - very behind - on dealing with curses , " said Moody . 
" So I'm here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other . 
I ' ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark - " " What , aren't you staying ? " Ron blurted out . 
Moody's magical eye spun around to stare at Ron ; Ron looked extremely apprehensive , but after a moment Moody smiled - the first time Harry had seen him do so . 
The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever , but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile . 
Ron looked deeply relieved . 
" Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago . 
Special favor to Dumbledore . . . . 
One year , and then back to my quiet retirement . " 
He gave a harsh laugh , and then clapped his gnarled hands together . 
" So - straight into it . 
Curses . 
Now , according to the Ministry of Magic , I'm supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that . 
You ' re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then . 
But Professor Dumbledore's got a higher opinion of your nerves , he reckons you can cope , and I say , the sooner you know what you ' re up against , the better . 
How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you ' ve never seen ? 
A wizard who's about to put an illegal curse on you isn't going to tell you what he's about to do . 
He's not going to do it nice and polite to your face . 
You need to be prepared . 
You need to be alert and watchful . 
You need to put that away , Miss Brown , when I'm talking . " 
Lavender jumped and blushed . 
Apparently Moody's magical eye could see through solid wood , as well as out of the back of his head . 
" So . . . 
Several hands rose tentatively into the air , including Ron's and Hermione's . 
Moody pointed at Ron , though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender . 
Is it called the Imperius Curse , or something ? " 
" Ah , yes , " said Moody appreciatively . 
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time , the Imperius Curse . " 
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet , opened his desk drawer , and took out a glass jar . 
Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it . 
Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him - Ron hated spiders . 
Moody reached into the jar , caught one of the spiders , and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it . 
He then pointed his wand at it and muttered , " Imperio ! " 
The spider leapt from Moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze . 
It stretched out its legs rigidly , then did a back flip , breaking the thread and landing on the desk , where it began to cartwheel in circles . 
Everyone was laughing - everyone except Moody . 
" You'd like it , would you , if I did it to you ? " 
" Total control , " said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over . 
" I could make it jump out of the window , drown itself , throw itself down one of your throats . . 
" Years back , there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse , " said Moody , and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all - powerful . 
Better avoid being hit with it if you can . 
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar . 
Another illegal curse ? " 
Hermione's hand flew into the air again and so , to Harry's slight surprise , did Neville's . 
The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was 
Neville looked surprised at his own daring . 
" There's one - the Cruciatus Curse , " said Neville in a small but distinct voice . 
Moody was looking very intently at Neville , this time with both eyes . 
" Your name's Longbottom ? " he said , his magical eye swooping down to check the register again . 
Neville nodded nervously , but Moody made no further inquiries . 
Turning back to the class at large , he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop , where it remained motionless , apparently too scared to move . 
" The Cruciatus Curse , " said Moody . 
" Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea , " he said , pointing his wand at the spider . 
" Engorgio ! " 
It was now larger than a tarantula . 
Abandoning all pretense , Ron pushed his chair backward , as far away from Moody's desk as possible . 
Moody raised his wand again , pointed it at the spider , and muttered , " Crucio ! " 
At once , the spider's legs bent in upon its body ; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly , rocking from side to side . 
No sound came from it , but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice , it would have been screaming . 
Hermione said shrilly . " 
Harry looked around at her . 
She was looking , not at the spider , but at Neville , and Harry , following her gaze , saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him , his knuckles white , his eyes wide and horrified . 
Moody raised his wand . 
The spider's legs relaxed , but it continued to twitch . 
" Reducio , " Moody muttered , and the spider shrank back to its proper size . 
He put it back into the jar . 
" Pain , " said Moody softly . 
" You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse . . . . 
" Right . . . 
Harry looked around . 
From the looks on everyone's faces , he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider . 
Hermione's hand shook slightly as , for the third time , she raised it into the air . 
" Yes ? " said Moody , looking at her . 
" Avada Kedavra , " Hermione whispered . 
Several people looked uneasily around at her , including Ron . " Ah , " said Moody , another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth . 
" Yes , the last and worst . 
Avada Kedavra . 
.. the Killing Curse . " 
He put his hand into the glass jar , and almost as though it knew what was coming , the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar , trying to evade Moody's fingers , but he trapped it , and placed it upon the desktop . 
Moody raised his wand , and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding . 
" Avada Kedavra ! " Moody roared . 
There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound , as though a vast , invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back , unmarked , but unmistakably dead . 
Several of the students stifled cries ; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him . 
Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor . 
" Not nice , " he said calmly . 
" Not pleasant . 
And there's no countercurse . 
There's no blocking it . 
Only one known person has ever survived it , and he's sitting right in front of me . " 
Harry felt his face redden as Moody's eyes ( both of them ) looked into his own . 
Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it , but not really seeing it at all .... 
So that was how his parents had died . . . 
Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death , before life was wiped from their bodies ? 
Harry had been picturing his parents'deaths over and over again for three years now , ever since he'd found out they had been murdered , ever since he'd found out what had happened that night : Wormtail had betrayed his parents ' whereabouts to Voldemort , who had come to find them at their cottage . 
How James Potter had tried to hold him off , while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run . . . 
Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter , told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry .. . 
how she had begged him to kill her instead , refused to stop shielding her son .. . 
and so Voldemort had murdered her too , before turning his wand on Harry . 
Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents ' voices when he had fought the dementors last year - for that was the terrible power of the dementors : to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives , and drown , powerless , in their own despair . 
Moody was speaking again , from a great distance , it seemed to Harry . 
With a massive effort , he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying . 
" Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words , and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed . 
I'm not here to teach you how to do it . 
" Now , if there's no countercurse , why am I showing you ? 
Because you ' ve got to know . 
You ' ve got to appreciate what the worst is . 
You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you ' re facing it . 
CONSTANT VIGILANCE ! " he roared , and the whole class jumped again . 
" Now . . . 
The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban . 
That's what you ' re up against . 
That's what I ' ve got to teach you to fight . 
You need preparing . 
You need arming . 
Get out your quills . . . 
copy this down . . . 
They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses . 
No one spoke until the bell rang - but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom , a torrent of talk burst forth . 
They were talking about the lesson , Harry thought , as though it had been some sort of spectacular show , but he hadn't found it very entertaining - and nor , it seemed , had Hermione . 
" Hurry up , " she said tensely to Harry and Ron . 
" Not the ruddy library again ? " said Ron . " No , " said Hermione curtly , pointing up a side passage . 
" Neville . " 
Neville was standing alone , halfway up the passage , staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified , wide - eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse . 
" Neville ? " 
Hermione said gently . 
Neville looked around . 
" Oh hello , " he said , his voice much higher than usual . 
I wonder what's for dinner , I'm - I'm starving , aren't you ? " " Neville , are you all right ? " said Hermione . 
Ron gave Harry a startled look . 
" Neville , what - ? " 
But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them , and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them . 
" Why don't you come up to my office ? 
Come on . . . 
we can have a cup of tea . . . 
Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody . 
Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry . 
" You all right , are you , Potter ? " " Yes , " said Harry , almost defiantly . 
Moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry . 
Then he said , " You ' ve got to know . 
No point pretending . . . 
well .. . 
come on , Longbottom , I ' ve got some books that might interest you . " 
Neville looked pleadingly at Harry , Ron , and Hermione , but they didn't say anything , so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away , one of Moody's gnarled hands on his shoulder . 
" What was that about ? " said Ron , watching Neville and Moody turn the corner . 
" I don't know , " said Hermione , looking pensive . 
" Some lesson , though , eh ? " said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall . 
" Fred and George were right , weren't they ? 
When he did Avada Kedavra , the way that spider just died , just snuffed it right - " But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry's face and didn't speak again until they reached the Great Hall , when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney's predictions tonight , since they would take hours . 
Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron's conversation during dinner , but ate furiously fast , and then left for the library again . 
Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower , and Harry , who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner , now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself . 
" Wouldn't Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we'd seen the curses ? " 
Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady . 
" Yeah , probably , " said Ron . " But Dumbledore's always done things his way , hasn't he , and Moody's been getting in trouble for years , I reckon . 
The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole , and they climbed into the Gryffindor common room , which was crowded and noisy . 
" Shall we get our Divination stuff , then ? " said Harry . 
" I s ' pose , " Ron groaned . 
They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts , to find Neville there alone , sitting on his bed , reading . 
His eyes were rather red . 
" You all right , Neville ? " 
Harry asked him . 
" Oh yes , " said Neville , " I'm fine , thanks . 
Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me . . 
He held up the book : Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean . 
" Apparently , Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology , " Neville said . 
There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before . 
" He thought I'd like this . " Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said , Harry thought , had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up , for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything . 
It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done . 
Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room , found a table , and set to work on their predictions for the coming month . 
An hour later , they had made very little progress , though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols , and Harry's brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney's fire . 
" You know , " said Ron , whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration , " I think it's back to the old Divination standby . " 
" What - make it up ? " " Yeah , " said Ron , sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table , dipping his pen into some ink , and starting to write . 
" Next Monday , " he said as he scribbled , " I am likely to develop a cough , owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter . " 
He looked up at Harry . 
" Right , " said Harry , crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire . 
" Okay . . . on Monday , I will be in danger of - er - burns . " 
" Yeah , you will be , " said Ron darkly , " we ' re seeing the skrewts again on Monday . 
Okay , Tuesday , I ' ll . . . 
" Good one , " said Ron , copying it down . 
Why don't you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend ? " 
" Yeah . . . 
cool . . 
. " said Harry , scribbling it down , " because ... Venus is in the twelfth house . " 
" And on Wednesday , I think I ' ll come off worst in a fight . " 
" Aaah , I was going to have a fight . 
Okay , I ' ll lose a bet . " " Yeah , you ' ll be betting I ' ll win my fight . 
.. They continued to make up predictions ( which grew steadily more tragic ) for another hour , while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed . 
Crookshanks wandered over to them , leapt lightly into an empty chair , and stared inscrutably at Harry , rather as Hermione might look if she knew they weren't doing their homework properly . 
Staring around the room , trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn't yet used , Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall , heads together , quills out , poring over a single piece of parchment . 
It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently ; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention . 
There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment , and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow . 
He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys ' Wizard Wheezes , but it didn't look like that this time ; if it had been , they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke . 
He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament . 
Got to be careful . . 
Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him . 
Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions - he didn't want George to think he was eavesdropping . 
Shortly after that , the twins rolled up their parchment , said good night , and went off to bed . 
Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other . 
" Hello , " she said , " I ' ve just finished ! " 
Hermione sat down , laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair , and pulled Ron's predictions toward her . 
" Not going to have a very good month , are you ? " 
" Ah well , at least I'm forewarned , " Ron yawned . 
" You seem to be drowning twice , " said Hermione . 
" Don't you think it's a bit obvious you ' ve made these up ? " said Hermione . 
" How dare you ! " said Ron , in mock outrage . 
Hermione raised her eyebrows . 
" It's just an expression , " said Ron hastily . 
" What's in the box ? " he asked , pointing at it . 
" Funny you should ask , " said Hermione , with a nasty look at Ron . 
She took off the lid and showed them the contents . 
" What's this about ? " 
" Not spew , " said Hermione impatiently . 
" It's S - P - E - W . 
Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare . " 
" Yeah ? " said Ron in mild surprise . 
" How many members have you got ? " 
" Well - if you two join - three , " said Hermione . 
" And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying'spew ,'do you ? " said Ron . " S - P - E - W ! " said Hermione hotly . 
So that's the heading of our manifesto . " 
She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them . 
" I ' ve been researching it thoroughly in the library . 
I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now . " 
" Hermione - open your ears , " said Ron loudly . 
" They . 
Like . 
It . 
They like being enslaved ! " 
Our long - term aims include changing the law about nonwand use , and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , because they ' re shockingly underrepresented . " 
" And how do we do all this ? " 
Harry asked . 
" We start by recruiting members , " said Hermione happily . 
" I thought two Sickles to join - that buys a badge - and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign . 
You ' re treasurer , Ron - I ' ve got you a collecting tin upstairs - and Harry , you ' re secretary , so you might want to write down everything I'm saying now , as a record of our first meeting . " 
There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them , and Harry sat , torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron's face . 
The silence was broken , not by Ron , who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck , but by a soft tap , tap on the window . 
Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw , illuminated by the moonlight , a snowy owl perched on the windowsill . 
" Hedwig ! " he shouted , and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window . 
Hedwig flew inside , soared across the room , and landed on the table on top of Harry's predictions . 
" About time ! " said Harry , hurrying after her . 
" What does it say ? " 
Hermione asked breathlessly . 
Harry read it aloud : Harry I'm flying north immediately . 
This news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here . 
If it hurts again , go straight to Dumbledore - they ' re saying he's got Mad - Eye out of retirement , which means he's reading the signs , even if no one else is . 
I ' ll be in touch soon . 
My best to Ron and Hermione . 
Sirius Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione , who stared back at him . 
" He's flying north ? " 
Hermione whispered . 
" Harry - what's up ? " 
For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist , jolting Hedwig out of his lap . 
" I shouldn't ' ve told him ! " 
Harry said furiously . 
" What are you on about ? " said Ron in surprise . 
" It's made him think he's got to come back ! " said Harry , now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron's chair , hooting indignantly . 
" Coming back , because he thinks I'm in trouble ! 
And there's nothing wrong with me ! 
And I haven't got anything for you , " Harry snapped at Hedwig , who was clicking her beak expectantly , " you ' ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food . " 
" Harry , " Hermione began , in a pacifying sort of voice . 
" I'm going to bed , " said Harry shortly . 
" See you in the morning . " 
Upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four - poster , but he didn't feel remotely tired . 
If Sirius came back and got caught , it would be his , Harry's , fault . 
If he'd just had the sense to keep it to himself . 
He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later , but did not speak to him . 
For a long time , Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed . 
The dormitory was completely silent , and , had he been less preoccupied , Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville's usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake . 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN : BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG 
Early next morning , Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind , as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night . 
He got up , dressed in the pale dawn light , left the dormitory without waking Ron , and went back down to the deserted common room . 
Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter : Dear Sirius , I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting , I was half asleep when I wrote to you last time . 
Don't worry about me , my head feels completely normal . 
Harry He then climbed out of the portrait hole , up through the silent castle ( held up only briefly by Peeves , who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourth - floor corridor ) , finally arriving at the Owlery , which was situated at the top of West Tower . 
The Owlery was a circular stone room , rather cold and drafty , because none of the windows had glass in them . 
The floor was entirely covered in straw , owl droppings , and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles . 
Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower , nearly all of them asleep , though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry . 
He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny , and hurried over to her , sliding a little on the dropping - strewn floor . 
It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him , as she kept shuffling around on her perch , showing him her tail . 
In the end , it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired , and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon , that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it . 
" Just find him , all right ? " 
Harry said , stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall . 
" Before the dementors do . " 
Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise . 
Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach . 
" That was a lie , Harry , " said Hermione sharply over breakfast , when he told her and Ron what he had done . 
" So what ? " said Harry . 
" He's not going back to Azkaban because of me . " " Drop it , " said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more , and for once , Hermione heeded him , and fell silent . 
Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks . 
He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him ; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good , hard training session . 
On the other hand , their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before , particularly Moody's Defense Against the Dark Arts . 
To their surprise , Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn , to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects . 
" But - but you said it's illegal , Professor , " said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand , leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room . 
" If you'd rather learn the hard way - when someone's putting it on you so they can control you completely - fine by me . 
You ' re excused . 
Off you go . " 
He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door . 
Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave . 
Harry and Ron grinned at each other . 
They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson . 
Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them . 
Harry watched as , one by one , his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence . 
Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room , singing the national anthem . 
Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel . 
Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state . 
Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse , and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it . 
" Potter , " Moody growled , " you next . " 
Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom , into the space that Moody had cleared of desks . 
Moody raised his wand , pointed it at Harry , and said , ' 1 mperio ! " 
It was the most wonderful feeling . 
Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away , leaving nothing but a vague , untraceable happiness . 
He stood there feeling immensely relaxed , only dimly aware of everyone watching him . 
And then he heard Mad - Eye Moody's voice , echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain : Jump onto the desk . . . 
Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain . 
Stupid thing to do , really , said the voice . 
Jump onto the desk .... No , I don't think I will , thanks , said the other voice , a little more firmly . . . 
no , I don't really want to . 
He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping - the result was that he'd smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over , and , by the feeling in his legs , fractured both his kneecaps . 
" Now , that's more like it ! " 
growled Moody's voice , and suddenly , Harry felt the empty , echoing feeling in his head disappear . 
He remembered exactly what was happening , and the pain in his knees seemed to double . 
" Look at that , you lot . . . 
Potter fought ! 
He fought it , and he damn near beat it ! 
We ' ll try that again , Potter , and the rest of you , pay attention - watch his eyes , that's where you see it - very good , Potter , very good indeed ! 
They ' ll have trouble controlling you ! " " The way he talks , " Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later ( Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row , until Harry could throw off the curse entirely ) , " you'd think we were all going to be attacked any second . " 
He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry , though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime . 
Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ' Boo ' behind him on April Fools ' Day ? 
And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we ' ve got to do ? " 
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term . 
Professor McGonagall explained why , when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned . 
" Maybe not , Thomas , but believe me , you need all the preparation you can get ! 
Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion . 
Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class . 
She read out large portions of their predictions , commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them - but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next ; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes . 
Meanwhile Professor Binns , the ghost who taught History of Magic , had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century . 
They took this one seriously , as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked . 
Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms . 
Hagrid was delighted , and as part of their " project , " suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior . 
Hagrid's smile faded off his face . 
The Gryffindors roared with laughter . 
Malfoy flushed with anger , but apparently the memory of Moody's punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits ; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying , especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year . 
When they arrived in the entrance hall , they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there , all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase . 
Ron , the tallest of the three , stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two : 
TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT THE DELEGATIONS FROM BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG WILL BE ARRIVING AT 6 O ' CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE 30 TH OF OCTOBER . 
" Only a week away ! " said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff , emerging from the crowd , his eyes gleaming . 
Think I ' ll go and tell him . . . 
. " " Cedric ? " said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off . 
" Diggory , " said Harry . 
" He must be entering the tournament . " 
" That idiot , Hogwarts champion ? " said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase . 
" He's not an idiot . 
You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch , " said Hermione . 
" I ' ve heard he's a really good student - and he's a prefect . " 
" You only like him because he's handsome , " said Ron scathingly . 
Ron gave a loud false cough , which sounded oddly like " Lockhart ! " 
The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle . 
During the following week , there seemed to be only one topic of conversation , no matter where Harry went : the Triwizard Tournament . 
Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs : who was going to try for Hogwarts champion , what the tournament would involve , how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves . 
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra - thorough cleaning . 
The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking , and Argus Filch , the caretaker , was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first - year girls into hysterics . 
" Longbottom , kindly do not reveal that you can't even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang ! " Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson , during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus . 
When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October , they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight . 
Enormous silk banners hung from the walls , each of them representing a Hogwarts House : red with a gold lion for Gryffiindor , blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw , yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff , and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin . 
Behind the teachers ' table , the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms : lion , eagle , badger , and snake united around a large letter H . Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table . 
Once again , and most unusually , they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices . 
Ron led the way over to them . 
" It's a bummer , all right , " George was saying gloomily to Fred . 
" But if he won't talk to us in person , we ' ll have to send him the letter after all . 
" Who's avoiding you ? " said Ron , sitting down next to them . 
" What's a bummer ? " 
Ron asked George . 
" Having a nosy git like you for a brother , " said George . 
Harry asked . 
" Wonder what the tasks are going to be ? " said Ron thoughtfully . 
" You know , I bet we could do them , Harry . 
. " " Not in front of a panel of judges , you haven't , " said Fred . " McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they ' ve done the tasks . " 
" Who are the judges ? " 
Harry asked . 
" Well , the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel , " said Hermione , and everyone looked around at her , rather surprised , " because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792 , when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage . " 
Though , of course , that book's not entirely reliable . 
Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts , Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School . " 
" What are you on about ? " said Ron , though Harry thought he knew what was coming . 
" House - elves ! " said Hermione , her eyes flashing . 
" Not once , in over a thousand pages , does Hogwarts , A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves ! " 
Harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs . 
His and Ron's lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione's determination to pursue justice for house - elves . 
Their Sickles had been wasted , however ; if anything , they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous . 
She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since , first to wear the badges , then to persuade others to do the same , and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening , cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses . 
" You do realize that your sheets are changed , your fires lit , your classrooms cleaned , and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved ? " 
she kept saying fiercely . 
Some people , like Neville , had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at them . 
A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say , but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning . 
Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling , which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight , and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon ( both twins had refused to buy a S . P . E . W . badge ) . 
" Listen , have you ever been down in the kitchens , Hermione ? " 
And we ' ve met them , and they ' re happy . 
They think they ' ve got the best job in the world - " " That's because they ' re uneducated and brainwashed ! " 
Hermione began hotly , but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead , which announced the arrival of the post owls . 
Harry looked up at once , and saw Hedwig soaring toward him . 
Hermione stopped talking abruptly ; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry's shoulder , folded her wings , and held out her leg wearily . 
Then , checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament , Harry read out Sirius's letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione . 
Nice try , Harry . 
I want you to keep me posted on everything that's going on at Hogwarts . 
Sirius " Why d ' you have to keep changing owls ? " Ron asked in a low voice . 
I mean , they ' re not native birds , are they ? " 
Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes , wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before . 
He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something . 
" Thanks , Hedwig , " he said , stroking her . 
There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day . 
Nobody was very attentive in lessons , being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang ; even Potions was more bearable than usual , as it was half an hour shorter . 
When the bell rang early , Harry , Ron , and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower , deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed , pulled on their cloaks , and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall . 
" Weasley , straighten your hat , " Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron . " Miss Patil , take that ridiculous thing out of your hair . " 
" Follow me , please , " said Professor McGonagall . 
no pushing .. . 
They filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle . 
It was a cold , clear evening ; dusk was falling and a pale , transparent - looking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry , standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front , saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years . 
" Nearly six , " said Ron , checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates . 
The train ? " " I doubt it , " said Hermione . 
" How , then ? 
Harry suggested , looking up at the starry sky . 
" I don't think so . . . 
not from that far away .. . 
" A Portkey ? " Ron suggested . 
Harry was starting to feel cold . 
He wished they'd hurry up . 
He remembered what Mr . Weasley had said back at the campsite before the Quidditch World Cup : " always the same - we can't resist showing off when we get together . 
And then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers - " Aha ! Unless I am very much mistaken , the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches ! " " Where ? " said many students eagerly , all looking in different directions . 
" There ! " yelled a sixth year , pointing over the forest . 
Something large , much larger than a broomstick - or , indeed , a hundred broomsticks - was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle , growing larger all the time . 
it's a flying house ! " said Dennis Creevey . 
As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it , they saw a gigantic , powderblue , horse - drawn carriage , the size of a large house , soaring toward them , pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses , all palominos , and each the size of an elephant . 
The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower , coming in to land at a tremendous speed - then , with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year's foot , the horses ' hooves , larger than dinner plates , hit the ground . 
A second later , the carriage landed too , bouncing upon its vast wheels , while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large , fiery red eyes . 
Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms ( two crossed , golden wands , each emitting three stars ) before it opened . 
A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage , bent forward , fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor , and unfolded a set of golden steps . 
He sprang back respectfully . 
Then Harry saw a shining , high - heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage - a shoe the size of a child's sled followed , almost immediately , by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life . 
The size of the carriage , and of the horses , was immediately explained . 
A few people gasped . 
Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life , and that was Hagrid ; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights . 
Yet somehow - maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid - this woman ( now at the foot of the steps , and looking around at the waiting , wide - eyed crowd ) seemed even more unnaturally large . 
As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall , she was revealed to have a handsome , olive - skinned face ; large , black , liquid - looking eyes ; and a rather beaky nose . 
She was dressed from head to foot in black satin , and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers . 
Dumbledore started to clap ; the students , following his lead , broke into applause too , many of them standing on tiptoe , the better to look at this woman . 
Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore , extending a glittering hand . 
Dumbledore , though tall himself , had barely to bend to kiss it . 
" My dear Madame Maxime , " he said . 
" Welcome to Hogwarts . " 
" Dumbly - dort , " said Madame Maxime in a deep voice . 
" I ' ope I find you well ? " " In excellent form , I thank you , " said Dumbledore . " My pupils , " said Madame Maxime , waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her . 
Harry , whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime , now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls , all , by the look of them , in their late teens , had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime . 
A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads . 
From what Harry could see of them ( they were standing in Madame Maxime's enormous shadow ) , they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces . 
" As Karkaroff arrived yet ? " 
Madame Maxime asked . 
" He should be here any moment , " said Dumbledore . " Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle ? " 
" Warm up , I think , " said Madame Maxime . 
" Skrewts , " Ron muttered to Harry , grinning . 
" Zey are very strong . . . 
. " " I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job , " said Dumbledore , smiling . 
" Very well , " said Madame Maxime , bowing slightly . 
" Come , " said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students , and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps . 
" How big d ' you reckon Durmstrang's horses are going to be ? " Seamus Finnigan said , leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron . 
" Imagine that lot loose on the grounds . . . 
Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky . 
For a few minutes , the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime's huge horses snorting and stamping . 
But then - " Can you hear something ? " said Ron suddenly . 
Harry listened ; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness : a muffled rumbling and sucking sound , as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed . 
" Look at the lake ! " From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds , they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water - except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all . 
Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center ; great bubbles were forming on the surface , waves were now washing over the muddy banks - and then , out in the very middle of the lake , a whirlpool appeared , as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake's floor . . 
What seemed to be a long , black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool . . . 
and then Harry saw the rigging .... " It's a mast ! " he said to Ron and Hermione . 
Slowly , magnificently , the ship rose out of the water , gleaming in the moonlight . 
It had a strangely skeletal look about it , as though it were a resurrected wreck , and the dim , misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes . 
Finally , with a great sloshing noise , the ship emerged entirely , bobbing on the turbulent water , and began to glide toward the bank . 
A few moments later , they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows , and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank . 
People were disembarking ; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ship's portholes . 
All of them , Harry noticed , seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle ... but then , as they drew nearer , walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall , he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy , matted fur . 
But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort : 
sleek and silver , like his hair . 
" Dumbledore ! " he called heartily as he walked up the slope . 
" How are you , my dear fellow , how are you ? " 
" Blooming , thank you , Professor Karkaroff , " Dumbledore replied . 
Karkaroff had a fruity , unctuous voice ; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore , but his white hair was short , and his goatee ( finishing in a small curl ) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin . 
When he reached Dumbledore , he shook hands with both of his own . 
" Dear old Hogwarts , " he said , looking up at the castle and smiling ; his teeth were rather yellow , and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes , which remained cold and shrewd . 
" How good it is to be here , how good .. . . 
Viktor has a slight head cold ... " Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students . 
As the boy passed , Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows . 
He didn't need the punch on the arm Ron gave him , or the hiss in his ear , to recognize that profile . 
" Harry - it's Krum ! " 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN : THE GOBLET OF FIRE 
I don't believe it ! " 
Ron said , in a stunned voice , as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang . 
" Krum , Harry ! 
Viktor Krum ! " " For heaven's sake , Ron , he's only a Quidditch player , " said Hermione . 
" Only a Quidditch player ? " 
" Hermione - he's one of the best Seekers in the world ! 
As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall , Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum's head . 
" Really , " Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls , now squabbling over the lipstick . 
" I'm getting his autograph if I can , " said Ron . " You haven't got a quill , have you , Harry ? " " Nope , they ' re upstairs in my bag , " said Harry . 
They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down . 
Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway , because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it , apparently unsure about where they should sit . 
The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table . 
Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads . 
" It's not that cold , " said Hermione defensively . 
Come and sit over here ! " 
Ron hissed . 
" Over here ! 
Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table . 
Harry could see Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle looking very smug about this . 
As he watched , Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum . 
" Yeah , that's right , smarm up to him , Malfoy , " said Ron scathingly . 
Hermione snorted . 
" They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot , " said Harry . 
The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest ; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them , apparently impressed . 
Up at the staff table , Filch , the caretaker , was adding chairs . 
He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion . 
Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs , two on either side of Dumbledore's . 
" But there are only two extra people , " Harry said . 
" Eh ? " said Ron vaguely . 
He was still staring avidly at Krum . 
When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables , the staff entered , filing up to the top table and taking their seats . 
Last in line were Professor Dumbledore , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime . 
A few of the Hogwarts students laughed . 
The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed , however , and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore's left - hand side . 
Dumbledore remained standing , and a silence fell over the Great Hall . 
" Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ghosts and - most particularly - guests , " said Dumbledore , beaming around at the foreign students . 
" I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts . 
I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable . " 
One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh . 
" No one's making you stay ! " Hermione whispered , bristling at her . " The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast , " said Dumbledore . " I now invite you all to eat , drink , and make yourselves at home ! " 
He sat down , and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation . 
The plates in front of them filled with food as usual . 
The house - elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops ; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen , including several that were definitely foreign . 
" What's that ? " said Ron , pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak - and - kidney pudding . 
" Bouillabaisse , " said Hermione . 
" Bless you , " said Ron . " It's French , " said Hermione , " I had it on holiday summer before last . 
It's very nice . " 
The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual , even though there were barely twenty additional students there ; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts ' robes . 
Now that they had removed their furs , the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred . 
Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast . 
He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry , Ron , and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand . 
" Skrewts doing all right , Hagrid ? " 
Harry called . 
" Thrivin ' , " Hagrid called back happily . 
" Yeah , I ' ll just bet they are , " said Ron quietly . 
" Looks like they ' ve finally found a food they like , doesn't it ? 
Hagrid's fingers . " 
At that moment , a voice said , " Excuse me , are you wanting ze bouillabaisse ? " 
It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore's speech . 
A long sheet of silvery - blonde hair fell almost to her waist . 
She had large , deep blue eyes , and very white , even teeth . 
Ron went purple . 
" Yeah , have it , " said Harry , pushing the dish toward the girl . 
" You ' ave finished wiz it ? " 
" Yeah , " Ron said breathlessly . 
" Yeah , it was excellent . " 
The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table . 
Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before . 
Harry started to laugh . 
The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses . 
" She's a veela ! " he said hoarsely to Harry . 
" Of course she isn't ! " said Hermione tartly . 
As the girl crossed the Hall , many boys ' heads turned , and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless , just like Ron . " I'm telling you , that's not a normal girl ! " said Ron , leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her . 
Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair . 
She was pointing up at the staff table . 
Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff's other side , while Mr . Crouch , Percy's boss , was next to Madame Maxime . 
" What are they doing here ? " said Harry in surprise . 
" I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start . " 
When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too . 
Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely , then moved it carefully a few inches to his right , so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table . 
The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough , however , and did not come over to get it . 
Once the golden plates had been wiped clean , Dumbledore stood up again . 
A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now . 
Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement , wondering what was coming . 
Several seats down from them , Fred and George were leaning forward , staring at Dumbledore with great concentration . 
" The Triwizard Tournament is about to start . 
I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket -- " " The what ? " 
Harry muttered . 
Ron shrugged . 
" - just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year . 
But first , let me introduce , for those who do not know them , Mr . Bartemius Crouch , Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation " - there was a smattering of polite applause - " and Mr . Ludo Bagman , Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports . " 
There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch , perhaps because of his fame as a Beater , or simply because he looked so much more likable . 
He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand . 
Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced . 
Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup , Harry thought he looked strange in wizard's robes . 
His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore's long white hair and beard . 
" Mr . 
Bagman and Mr . Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament , " Dumbledore continued , " and they will be joining myself , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions ' efforts . " 
At the mention of the word " champions , " the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen . 
Filch , who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall , now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels . 
It looked extremely old . 
" The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr . Crouch and Mr . Bagman , " said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him , " and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge . 
There will be three tasks , spaced throughout the school year , and they will test the champions in many different ways .. their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and , of course , their ability to cope with danger . " 
At this last word , the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing . 
" As you know , three champions compete in the tournament , " Dumbledore went on calmly , " one from each of the participating schools . 
They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup . 
The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector : the Goblet of Fire . " 
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket . 
The lid creaked slowly open . 
Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large , roughly hewn wooden cup . 
It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue - white flames . 
Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it , where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall . 
" Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet , " said Dumbledore . " Aspiring champions have twenty - four hours in which to put their names forward . 
Tomorrow night , Halloween , the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools . 
" To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation , " said Dumbledore , " I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall . 
Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line . 
" Finally , I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly . 
Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire , he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end . 
The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding , magical contract . 
There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion . 
Please be very sure , therefore , that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet . 
Now , I think it is time for bed . 
Good night to you all . " 
" An Age Line ! " Fred Weasley said , his eyes glinting , as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall . 
. " " Speak for yourself , " said George shortly . 
Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore's insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name , but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again . 
He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line . 
" Where is he ? " said Ron , who wasn't listening to a word of this conversation , but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum . 
But this query was answered almost instantly ; they were level with the Slytherin table now , and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students . 
" Back to the ship , then , " he was saying . 
" Viktor , how are you feeling ? 
Did you eat enough ? 
Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on . 
" I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again , disgusting boy - " Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors , reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
Harry stopped to let him walk through first . 
" Thank you , " said Karkaroff carelessly , glancing at him . 
And then Karkaroff froze . 
He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn't believe his eyes . 
Karkaroff's eyes moved slowly up Harry's face and fixed upon his scar . 
The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too . 
Out of the corner of his eye , Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces . 
The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry's forehead . 
" Yeah , that's Harry Potter , " said a growling voice from behind them . 
Professor Karkaroff spun around . 
Mad - Eye Moody was standing there , leaning heavily on his staff , his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster . 
A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him . 
" You ! " he said , staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him . 
" Me , " said Moody grimly . 
" And unless you ' ve got anything to say to Potter , Karkaroff , you might want to move . 
You ' re blocking the doorway . " 
It was true ; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them , looking over one another's shoulders to see what was causing the holdup . 
Without another word , Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him . 
As the next day was Saturday , most students would normally have breakfasted late . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione , however , were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends . 
When they went down into the entrance hall , they saw about twenty people milling around it , some of them eating toast , all examining the Goblet of Fire . 
It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat . 
Ron asked a third - year girl eagerly . 
" But I haven't seen anyone from Hogwarts yet . " 
What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again ? " Someone laughed behind Harry . 
Turning , he saw Fred , George , and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase , all three of them looking extremely excited . 
" Done it , " Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
" Just taken it . " 
" What ? " said Ron . " The Aging Potion , dung brains , " said Fred . " One drop each , " said George , rubbing his hands together with glee . 
" We only need to be a few months older . " 
" We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins , " said Lee , grinning broadly . 
" I'm not sure this is going to work , you know , " said Hermione warningly . 
" I'm sure Dumbledore will have thought of this . " 
Fred , George , and Lee ignored her . 
" Ready ? " 
Fred said to the other two , quivering with excitement . 
" C ' mon , then - I ' ll go first - " Harry watched , fascinated , as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley - Hogwarts . 
Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there , rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty - foot drop . 
Then , with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him , he took a great breath and stepped over the line . 
For a split second Harry thought it had worked - George certainly thought so , for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred - but next moment , there was a loud sizzling sound , and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot - putter . 
They landed painfully , ten feet away on the cold stone floor , and to add insult to injury , there was a loud popping noise , and both of them sprouted identical long white beards . 
The entrance hall rang with laughter . 
Even Fred and George joined in , once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other's beards . 
" I did warn you , " said a deep , amused voice , and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall . 
He surveyed Fred and George , his eyes twinkling . 
" I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey . 
She is already tending to Miss Fawcett , of Ravenclaw , and Mr . Summers , of Hufflepuff , both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too . 
Fred and George set off for the hospital wing , accompanied by Lee , who was howling with laughter , and Harry , Ron , and Hermione , also chortling , went in to breakfast . 
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning . 
As it was Halloween , a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling , while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner . 
Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus , who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering . 
" There's a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in , " Dean told Harry . 
Harry , who had played Quidditch against Warrington , shook his head in disgust . 
" We can't have a Slytherin champion ! " 
" And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory , " said Seamus contemptuously . 
" Listen ! " said Hermione suddenly . 
They all swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall , grinning in an embarrassed sort of way . 
A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team , Angelina came over to them , sat down , and said , " Well , I ' ve done it ! 
" Are you seventeen , then ? " asked Harry . 
" What ' re we going to do today , then ? " 
Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall . 
" We haven't been down to visit Hagrid yet , " said Harry . 
" Okay , " said Ron , " just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts . " 
A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione's face . 
" I ' ve just realized - I haven't asked Hagrid to join S . P . E . W . yet ! " she said brightly . 
" Wait for me , will you , while I nip upstairs and get the badges ? " 
" What is it with her ? " said Ron , exasperated , as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase . 
" Hey , Ron , " said Harry suddenly . 
" It's your friend . . 
The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds , among them , the veela - girl . 
Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass , watching eagerly . 
Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line . 
One by one , the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue - white flames . 
As each name entered the fire , it turned briefly red and emitted sparks . 
" What d ' you reckon ' ll happen to the ones who aren't chosen ? " 
Ron muttered to Harry as the veela - girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire . 
" Reckon they ' ll go back to school , or hang around to watch the tournament ? " " Dunno , " said Harry . 
When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names , Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again . 
" Where are they sleeping , then ? " said Ron , moving toward the front doors and staring after them . 
" Oh good , hurry up , " said Ron , and he jumped down the stone steps , keeping his eyes on the back of the veela - girl , who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime . 
As they neared Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest , the mystery of the Beauxbatons'sleeping quarters was solved . 
The gigantic powder - blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid's front door , and the students were climbing back inside it . 
Harry knocked on Hagrid's door , and Fang's booming barks answered instantly . 
Hagrid was wearing his best ( and very horrible ) hairy brown suit , plus a checked yellow - and - orange tie . 
This wasn't the worst of it , though ; he had evidently tried to tame his hair , using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease . 
It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's , but found he had too much hair . 
For a moment , Hermione goggled at him , then , obviously deciding not to comment , she said , " Erm - where are the skrewts . " 
" Out by the pumpkin patch , " said Hagrid happily . 
" Oh no , really ? " said Hermione , shooting a repressive look at Ron , who , staring at Hagrid's odd hairstyle , had just opened his mouth to say something about it . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid sadly . 
" Well , that's lucky , " said Ron . Hagrid missed the sarcasm . 
Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room , in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt . 
A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling . 
They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea , and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament . 
Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were . 
" You wait , " he said , grinning . 
ah , but I'm not supposed ter say . " 
" Go on , Hagrid ! " Harry , Ron , and Hermione urged him , but he just shook his head , grinning . 
They ended up having lunch with Hagrid , though they didn't eat much - Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole , but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers , she , Harry , and Ron rather lost their appetites . 
However , they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be , speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions , and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet . 
A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon ; it was very cozy sitting by the fire , listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window , watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house - elves - for he flatly refused to join S . P . E . W . when she showed him her badges . 
" It's in their nature ter look after humans , that's what they like , see ? 
Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket . 
By half past five it was growing dark , and Ron , Harry , and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and , more important , the announcement of the school champions . 
Hagrid got up , went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed , and began searching for something inside it . 
Coughing , Ron said , " Hagrid , what's that ? " " Eh ? " said Hagrid , turning around with a large bottle in his hand . 
" Is that aftershave ? " said Hermione in a slightly choked voice . 
He was blushing . 
He stumped out of the cabin , and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window . 
" Eau de cologne ? " said Hermione in amazement . 
" Hagrid ? " " And what's with the hair and the suit ? " said Harry in an undertone . 
" Look ! " said Ron suddenly , pointing out of the window . 
Hagrid had just straightened up and turned ' round . 
If he had been blushing before , it was nothing to what he was doing now . 
Getting to their feet very cautiously , so that Hagrid wouldn't spot them , Harry , Ron , and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage , clearly about to set off for the feast too . 
They couldn't hear what Hagrid was saying , but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt , misty - eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before - when he had been looking at the baby dragon , Norbert . 
" He's going up to the castle with her ! " said Hermione indignantly . 
" He fancies her ! " said Ron incredulously . 
" Well , if they end up having children , they ' ll be setting a world record - bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton . " 
They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them . 
It was surprisingly dark outside . 
" Ooh it's them , look ! " Hermione whispered . 
The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake . 
Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff , and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them . 
Ron watched Krum excitedly , but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione , Ron , and Harry and proceeded through them . 
The Goblet of Fire had been moved ; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore's empty chair at the teachers ' table . 
Fred and George - clean - shaven again - seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well . 
" Hope it's Angelina , " said Fred as Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down . 
" So do I ! " said Hermione breathlessly . 
" Well , we ' ll soon know ! " 
The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual . 
Like everyone else in the Hall , judging by the constantly craning necks , the impatient expressions on every face , the fidgeting , and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet , Harry simply wanted the plates to clear , and to hear who had been selected as champions . 
At long last , the golden plates returned to their original spotless state ; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall , which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet . 
On either side of him , Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone . 
Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students . 
Mr . Crouch , however , looked quite uninterested , almost bored . 
Now , when the champions ' names are called , I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall , walk along the staff table , and go through into the next chamber " - he indicated the door behind the staff table - " where they will be receiving their first instructions . " 
He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it ; at once , all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished , plunging them into a state of semidarkness . 
The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall , the sparkling bright , bluey - whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes . 
" Any second , " Lee Jordan whispered , two seats away from Harry . 
The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again . 
Next moment , a tongue of flame shot into the air , a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it - the whole room gasped . 
Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length , so that he could read it by the light of the flames , which had turned back to blue - white . 
" The champion for Durmstrang , " he read , in a strong , clear voice , " will be Viktor Krum . " " No surprises there ! " yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall . 
Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore ; he turned right , walked along the staff table , and disappeared through the door into the next chamber . 
" Bravo , Viktor ! " boomed Karkaroff , so loudly that everyone could hear him , even over all the applause . 
" Knew you had it in you ! " 
Now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet , which , seconds later , turned red once more . 
A second piece of parchment shot out of it , propelled by the flames . 
" The champion for Beauxbatons , " said Dumbledore , " is Fleur Delacour ! " " It's her , Ron ! " Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet , shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair , and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables . 
" Oh look , they ' re all disappointed , " Hermione said over the noise , nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party . 
" Disappointed " was a bit of an understatement , Harry thought . 
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber , silence fell again , but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it . 
The Hogwarts champion next ... 
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more ; sparks showered out of it ; the tongue of flame shot high into the air , and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment . 
" The Hogwarts champion , " he called , " is Cedric Diggory ! " " No ! " said Ron loudly , but nobody heard him except Harry ; the uproar from the next table was too great . 
Indeed , the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again . 
" Well , we now have our three champions . 
I am sure I can count upon all of you , including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster . 
By cheering your champion on , you will contribute in a very real -- " But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking , and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him . 
The fire in the goblet had just turned red again . 
A long flame shot suddenly into the air , and borne upon it was another piece of parchment . 
He held it out and stared at the name written upon it . 
There was a long pause , during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands , and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore . 
And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out - " Harry Potter . " 
Harry sat there , aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at him . 
He was stunned . 
He felt numb . 
He was surely dreaming . 
There was no applause . 
A buzzing , as though of angry bees , was starting to fill the Hall ; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat , frozen , in his seat . 
Up at the top table , Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore , who bent his ear toward her , frowning slightly . 
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione ; beyond them , he saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him , openmouthed . 
" You know I didn't . " 
At the top table , Professor Dumbledore had straightened up , nodding to Professor McGonagall . 
" Harry Potter ! " he called again . 
" Harry ! 
Harry got to his feet , trod on the hem of his robes , and stumbled slightly . 
He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables . 
It felt like an immensely long walk ; the top table didn't seem to be getting any nearer at all , and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him , as though each were a searchlight . 
The buzzing grew louder and louder . 
After what seemed like an hour , he was right in front of Dumbledore , feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him . 
" Well .. . 
through the door , Harry , " said Dumbledore . 
He wasn't smiling . 
Hagrid was seated right at the end . 
He did not wink at Harry , or wave , or give any of his usual signs of greeting . 
He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else . 
Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room , lined with paintings of witches and wizards . 
A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him . 
The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered . 
He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it , which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache . 
The wizened witch started whispering in his ear . 
Viktor Krum , Cedric Diggory , and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire . 
Krum , hunchedup and brooding , was leaning against the mantelpiece , slightly apart from the other two . 
Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back , staring into the fire . 
" What is it ? " 
she said . 
Harry didn't know how to explain what had just happened . 
He just stood there , looking at the three champions . 
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him , and Ludo Bagman entered the room . 
" Extraordinary ! " he muttered , squeezing Harry's arm . 
lady , " he added , approaching the fireside and addressing the other three . 
Viktor Krum straightened up . 
His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry . 
He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said . 
Fleur Delacour , however , tossed her hair , smiling , and said , " Oh , vairy funny joke , Meester Bagman . " 
Bagman repeated , bewildered . 
Fleur frowned . 
" E cannot compete . 
' E is too young . " 
" Well . . . it is amazing , " said Bagman , rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry . 
And as his name's come out of the goblet .. . 
I mean , I don't think there can be any ducking out at this stage . . . . 
Harry will just have to do the best he -- " The door behind them opened again , and a large group of people came in : Professor Dumbledore , followed closely by Mr . Crouch , Professor Karkaroff , Madame Maxime , Professor McGonagall , and Professor Snape . 
Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall , before Professor 
McGonagall closed the door . 
The top of her handsome head brushed the candle - filled chandelier , and her gigantic black - satin bosom swelled . 
she said imperiously . 
" I'd rather like to know that myself , Dumbledore , " said Professor Karkaroff . 
" Two Hogwarts champions ? 
I don't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions - or have I not read the rules carefully enough ? " 
He gave a short and nasty laugh . 
It is most injust . " 
" We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants , Dumbledore , " said Karkaroff , his steely smile still in place , though his eyes were colder than ever . 
" Otherwise , we would , of course , have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools . " 
" It's no one's fault but Potter's , Karkaroff , " said Snape softly . 
His black eyes were alight with malice . 
" Don't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter's determination to break rules . 
Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry , who looked right back at him , trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half - moon spectacles . 
" Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire , Harry ? " he asked calmly . 
" No , " said Harry . 
Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows . 
" Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you ? " said Professor Dumbledore , ignoring Snape . 
" No , " said Harry vehemently . 
Snape was now shaking his head , his lip curling . 
" He could not have crossed the Age Line , " said Professor McGonagall sharply . 
" It is possible , of course , " said Dumbledore politely . 
" Dumbledore , you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake ! " said Professor McGonagall angrily . 
" Really , what nonsense ! 
Harry could not have crossed the line himself , and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him , I'm sure that should be good enough for everybody else ! " 
She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape . 
" Mr . 
Crouch .. . 
Mr . Bagman , " said Karkaroff , his voice unctuous once more , " you are our - er - objective judges . 
Surely you will agree that this is most irregular ? " 
Bagman wiped his round , boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr . Crouch , who was standing outside the circle of the firelight , his face half hidden in shadow . 
" We must follow the rules , and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament . " 
" Well , Barty knows the rule book back to front , " said Bagman , beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime , as though the matter was now closed . 
" I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students , " said Karkaroff . 
He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now . 
" You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more , and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions . 
" The Goblet of Fire's just gone out - it won't reignite until the start of the next tournament - " " - in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing ! " 
exploded Karkaroff . 
He's got to compete . 
Binding magical contract , like Dumbledore said . 
Convenient , eh ? " Moody had just entered the room . 
He limped toward the fire , and with every right step he took , there was a loud clunk . 
" Convenient ? " said Karkaroff . 
" I'm afraid I don't understand you , Moody . " 
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful , as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice , but his hands gave him away ; they had balled themselves into fists . 
" Don't you ? " said Moody quietly . 
" It's very simple , Karkaroff . 
Someone put Potter's name in that goblet knowing he'd have to compete if it came out . " 
" I quite agree , Madame Maxime , " said Karkaroff , bowing to her . " I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards - " " If anyone's got reason to complain , it's Potter , " growled Moody , " but . . . 
I don't hear him saying a word . . . 
A thousand Galleons in prize money - zis is a chance many would die for ! " " Maybe someone's hoping Potter is going to die for it , " said Moody , with the merest trace of a growl . 
" Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too . 
" Imagining things , am I ? " growled Moody . 
" Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object ! " said Moody . 
I'm guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school , to make sure he was the only one in his category .. . 
. " " You seem to have given this a great deal of thought , Moody , " said Karkaroff coldly , " and a very ingenious theory it is - though of course , I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg , and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock . 
So you ' ll understand if we don't take you entirely seriously . . . 
. " " There are those who ' ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage , " Moody retorted in a menacing voice . 
" It's my job to think the way Dark wizards do , Karkaroff - as you ought to remember ... " Alastor ! " said Dumbledore warningly . 
Harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to , but then realized " Mad - Eye " could hardly be Moody's real first name . 
Moody fell silent , though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction Karkaroff's face was burning . 
" How this situation arose , we do not know , " said Dumbledore , speaking to everyone gathered in the room . 
" It seems to me , however , that we have no choice but to accept it . 
Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament . 
This , therefore , they will do . . . 
" Ah , but Dumbly - dorr - " " My dear Madame Maxime , if you have an alternative , I would be delighted to hear it . " 
Dumbledore waited , but Madame Maxime did not speak , she merely glared . 
Snape looked furious ; Karkaroff livid ; Bagman , however , looked rather excited . 
" Well , shall we crack on , then ? " he said , rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room . 
Mr . Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie . 
" Yes , " he said , " instructions . 
Yes . . . the first task . . 
He moved forward into the firelight . 
Close up , Harry thought he looked ill . 
There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin , papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup . 
" The first task is designed to test your daring , " he told Harry , Cedric , Fleur , and Viktor , " so we are not going to be telling you what it is . 
Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard . . . 
" The first task will take place on November the twenty - fourth , in front of the other students and the panel of judges . 
" The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament . 
The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands . 
They will receive information about the second task when the first is over . 
Owing to the demanding and time - consuming nature of the tournament , the champions are exempted from end - of - year tests . " 
Mr . Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore . 
" I think that's all , is it , Albus ? " " I think so , " said Dumbledore , who was looking at Mr . Crouch with mild concern . 
" Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay at Hogwarts tonight , Barty ? " " No , Dumbledore , I must get back to the Ministry , " said Mr . Crouch . 
Very enthusiastic . . . 
" You ' ll come and have a drink before you go , at least ? " said Dumbledore . " Come on , Barry , I'm staying ! " said Bagman brightly . 
" I think not , Ludo , " said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience . 
" Professor Karkaroff - Madame Maxime - a nightcap ? " said Dumbledore . 
But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur's shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room . 
Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall . 
Karkaroff beckoned to Krum , and they , too , exited , though in silence . 
" Harry , Cedric , I suggest you go up to bed , " said Dumbledore , smiling at both of them . 
" I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you , and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise . " 
Harry glanced at Cedric , who nodded , and they left together . 
The Great Hall was deserted now ; the candles had burned low , giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie , flickering quality . 
" So , " said Cedric , with a slight smile . 
He really couldn't think of anything to say . 
The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray , as though his brain had been ransacked . 
" So . . . 
tell me . . 
. " said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall , which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire . 
" I didn't put it in . 
I was telling the truth . " 
" Ah . . . 
okay , " said Cedric . 
" Well . . . 
see you , then . " 
Instead of going up the marble staircase , Cedric headed for a door to its right . 
Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it , then , slowly , he started to climb the marble ones . 
Yes , he'd thought about it . . . 
he'd fantasized about it .. . 
Why ? 
To give him a treat ? 
Couldn't someone have put Harry's name in the goblet as a trick , a practical joke ? 
Harry was able to answer that at once . 
Lord Voldemort . 
But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry's name got into the Goblet of Fire ? 
feeble and powerless .... Yet in that dream he had had , just before he had awoken with his scar hurting , Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talking to Wormtail .. . 
plotting Harry's murder . 
It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame . 
Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest . 
" Well , well , well , " said the Fat Lady , " Violet's just told me everything . 
" No , no , Vi , it's the password , " said the Fat Lady soothingly , and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room . 
The blast of noise that met Harry's ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward . 
Next thing he knew , he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands , and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House , all of whom were screaming , applauding , and whistling . 
" How did you do it without getting a beard ? 
roared George . 
" I didn't , " Harry said . 
" We ' ve got food , Harry , come and have some - " " I'm not hungry , I had enough at the feast - " But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry ; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet ; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate . . . . Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere , and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak . 
Harry couldn't get away ; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories , the crowd around him closed ranks , forcing another butterbeer on him , stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands . . . . 
Everyone wanted to know how he had done it , how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet .... " I didn't , " he said , over and over again , " I don't know how it happened . " 
" I'm tired ! " he bellowed finally , after nearly half an hour . 
" No , seriously , George I'm going to bed - " He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione , to find a bit of sanity , but neither of them seemed to be in the common room . 
Insisting that he needed to sleep , and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs , Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could . 
To his great relief , he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory , still fully dressed . 
He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him . 
" Where ' ve you been ? " 
Harry said . 
" Oh hello , " said Ron . 
He was grinning , but it was a very odd , strained sort of grin . 
Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him . 
He hastened to take it off , but it was knotted very tightly . 
Ron lay on the bed without moving , watching Harry struggle to remove it . 
" So , " he said , when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner . 
" Congratulations . " 
" What d ' you mean , congratulations ? " said Harry , staring at Ron . 
There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling : It was more like a grimace . 
" Well . . . 
" Oh right , " said Ron . " I thought you might ' ve told me if it was the cloak . . . 
But you found another way , did you ? " " Listen , " said Harry , " I didn't put my name in that goblet . 
Ron raised his eyebrows . 
" What would they do that for ? " " I dunno , " said Harry . 
He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say , " To kill me . " 
Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair . 
" It's okay , you know , you can tell me the truth , " he said . 
" If you don't want everyone else to know , fine , but I don't know why you ' re bothering to lie , you didn't get into trouble for it , did you ? 
That friend of the Fat Lady's , that Violet , she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter . 
" Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night , and no one would ' ve seen you .. . . 
I'm not stupid , you know . " 
" You want to get to bed , Harry . 
I expect you ' ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo - call or something . " 
He wrenched the hangings shut around his four - poster , leaving Harry standing there by the door , staring at the dark red velvet curtains , now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him . 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN : THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS 
When Harry woke up on Sunday morning , it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried . 
Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him . 
He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four - poster , intending to talk to Ron , to force Ron to believe him - only to find that Ron's bed was empty ; he had obviously gone down to breakfast . 
Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room . 
The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors , all treating him like some sort of hero , was not inviting ; it was that , however , or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers , who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them . 
He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole , pushed it open , climbed out of it , and found himself face - to - face with Hermione . 
" Hello , " she said , holding up a stack of toast , which she was carrying in a napkin . 
" I brought you this . . . . 
Want to go for a walk ? " " Good idea , " said Harry gratefully . 
They went downstairs , crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall , and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake , where the Durmstrang ship was moored , reflected blackly in the water . 
It was a chilly morning , and they kept moving , munching their toast , as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before . 
" Well , of course I knew you hadn't entered yourself , " she said when he'd finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall . 
" The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name ! 
But the question is , who did put it in ? 
Because Moody's right , Harry ... 
Hermione hesitated . 
no , I don't think so . . . 
not really , " said Hermione awkwardly . 
" What's that supposed to mean , ' not really ' ? " 
" Oh Harry , isn't it obvious ? " 
Hermione said despairingly . 
" He's jealous ! " " Jealous ? " 
Harry said incredulously . 
He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school , does he ? " " Look , " said Hermione patiently , " it's always you who gets all the attention , you know it is . 
I know it's not your fault , " she added quickly , seeing Harry open his mouth furiously . 
" I know you don't ask for it .. . 
but - well - you know , Ron's got all those brothers to compete against at home , and you ' re his best friend , and you ' re really famous - he's always shunted to one side whenever people see you , and he puts up with it , and he never mentions it , but I suppose this is just one time too many . . . 
" Great , " said Harry bitterly . 
" Really great . 
Tell him from me he's welcome to it .... 
. " " I'm not teiling him anything , " Hermione said shortly . 
It's the only way to sort this out . " 
" That's not funny at all . " 
She looked extremely anxious . 
" Harry , I ' ve been thinking - you know what we ' ve got to do , don't you ? 
Straight away , the moment we get back to the castle ? " 
" Yeah , give Ron a good kick up the - " " Write to Sirius . 
You ' ve got to tell him what's happened . 
He asked you to keep him posted on everything that's going on at Hogwarts . . . . 
" He came back to the country just because my scar twinged . 
" He's going to find out anyway . " 
" How ? " " Harry , this isn't going to be kept quiet , " said Hermione , very seriously . 
" This tournament's famous , and you ' re famous . 
You ' re already in half the books about You - Know - Who , you know .. . 
" Okay , okay , I ' ll write to him , " said Harry , throwing his last piece of toast into the lake . 
They both stood and watched it floating there for a moment , before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface . 
Then they returned to the castle . 
" Whose owl am I going to use ? " Harry said as they climbed the stairs . 
" He told me not to use Hedwig again . " 
" Ask Ron if you can borrow - " " I'm not asking Ron for anything , " Harry said flatly . 
" Well , borrow one of the school owls , then , anyone can use them , " said Hermione . 
They went up to the Owlery . 
Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment , a quill , and a bottle of ink , then strolled around the long lines of perches , looking at all the different owls , while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter . 
Dear Sirius , You told me to keep you posted on what's happening at Hogwarts , so here goes - I don't know if you ' ve heard , but the Triwizard Tournament's happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion . 
I don't who put my name in the Goblet of Fire , because I didn't . 
He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night , but he couldn't think how to translate this into words , so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote , Hope you ' re okay , and Buckbeak - Harry " Finished , " he told Hermione , getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes . 
She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl . 
When the barn owl had flown off , Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig , but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach . 
" First Ron , then you , " Harry said angrily . 
If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion , the following day showed him how mistaken he was . 
He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it was clear that the rest of the school , just like the Gryffindors , thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament . 
The Hufflepuffs , who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors , had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them . 
It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory ; a feeling exacerbated , perhaps , by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory , and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any , having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch . 
Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley , with whom Harry normally got on very well , did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face . 
Ron wasn't talking to Harry either . 
Hermione sat between them , making very forced conversation , but though both answered her normally , they avoided making eye contact with each other . 
Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him - but then , she was Head of Hufflepuff House . 
" Ah , look , boys , it's the champion , " he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry . 
how long d ' you reckon you ' re going to last , Potter ? 
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically , but Malfoy had to stop there , because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates , each containing a very large Blast - Ended Skrewt . 
To the class's horror , Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent - up energy , and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk . 
" Take this thing for a walk ? " he repeated in disgust , staring into one of the boxes . 
Around the sting , the blasting end , or the sucker ? " 
" Roun'the middle , " said Hagrid , demonstrating . 
Harry - you come here an ' help me with this big one .... 
Hagrid's real intention , however , was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the class . 
In the tournament . 
School champion . " 
" One of the champions , " Harry corrected him . 
Hagrid's beetle - black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows . 
" Course I do , " Hagrid grunted . 
" Yeh say it wasn ' you , an ' I believe yeh - an ' Dumbledore believes yer , an ' all . " 
" Wish I knew who did do it , " said Harry bitterly . 
The pair of them looked out over the lawn ; the class was widely scattered now , and all in great difficulty . 
The skrewts were now over three feet long , and extremely powerful . 
They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs - but still without recognizable heads or eyes . 
They had become immensely strong and very hard to control . 
" Look like they ' re havin ' fun , don'they ? " Hagrid said happily . 
" Ah , I don ' know , Harry , " Hagrid sighed suddenly , looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face . 
" School champion . . . 
Harry didn't answer . 
Yes , everything did seem to happen to him . . . 
that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake , and that was the reason , according to her , that Ron was no longer talking to him . 
The next few days were some of Harry's worst at Hogwarts . 
But Ron had been on his side then . 
He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend , but he wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to . 
He could understand the Hufflepuffs ' attitude , even if he didn't like it ; they had their own champion to support . 
He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins - he was highly unpopular there and always had been , because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often , both at Quidditch and in the InterHouse Championship . 
He was wrong , however . 
Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name . 
Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did . 
Exceptionally handsome , with his straight nose , dark hair , and gray eyes , it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days , Cedric or Viktor Krum . 
Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius , Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him , Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual , and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick's class that he was given extra homework - the only person to get any , apart from Neville . 
" You just weren't concentrating properly - " " Wonder why that was , " said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past , surrounded by a large group of simpering girls , all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast - Ended Skrewt . 
Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon . . 
Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins , all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion , was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine . 
When he and Hermione arrived at Snape's dungeon after lunch , they found the Slytherins waiting outside , each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes . 
" Like them , Potter ? " said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached . 
The Slytherins howled with laughter . 
Each of them pressed their badges too , until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry . 
He felt the heat rise in his face and neck . 
" Oh very funny , " Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls , who were laughing harder than anyone , " really witty . " 
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus . 
" Want one , Granger ? " said Malfoy , holding out a badge to Hermione . 
" I ' ve got loads . 
But don't touch my hand , now . 
He had reached for his wand before he'd thought what he was doing . 
People all around them scrambled out of the way , backing down the corridor . 
" Harry ! " 
Hermione said warningly . 
" Moody's not here to look after you now - do it , if you ' ve got the guts - " For a split second , they looked into each other's eyes , then , at exactly the same time , both acted . 
Harry yelled . 
Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose , where great ugly boils were springing up Hermione , whimpering in panic , was clutching her mouth . 
" Hermione ! " 
Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her ; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face . 
Hermione's front teeth - already larger than average - were now growing at an alarming rate ; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated , past her bottom lip , toward her chin - panic - stricken , she felt them and let out a terrified cry . 
" And what is all this noise about ? " said a soft , deadly voice . 
The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations ; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said , " Explain . " 
" Potter attacked me , sir - " " We attacked each other at the same time ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" Hospital wing , Goyle , " Snape said calmly . 
" Malfoy got Hermione ! " 
Ron said . 
" Look ! " 
He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth - she was doing her best to hide them with her hands , though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar . 
Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles , pointing at Hermione from behind Snape's back . 
Snape looked coldly at Hermione , then said , " I see no difference . " . 
Hermione let out a whimper ; her eyes filled with tears , she turned on her heel and ran , ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight . 
It was lucky , perhaps , that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time ; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor , for in the confused din , it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him . 
" Let's see , " he said , in his silkiest voice . 
" Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley . 
Harry's ears were ringing . 
The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces . 
He passed Snape , walked with Ron to the back of the dungeon , and slammed his bag down onto the table . 
Ron was shaking with anger too - for a moment , it felt as though everything was back to normal between them , but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead , leaving Harry alone at his table . 
On the other side of the dungeon , Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge , smirking . 
Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began , picturing horrific things happening to him . . . . 
If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse . . . 
I want you to brew them carefully , and then , we will be selecting someone on whom to test one . . 
Snape's eyes met Harry's , and Harry knew what was coming . 
Snape was going to poison him . 
Harry imagined picking up his cauldron , and sprinting to the front of the class , and bringing it down on Snape's greasy head - And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry's thoughts . 
It was Colin Creevey ; he edged into the room , beaming at Harry , and walked up to Snape's desk at the front of the room . 
" Yes ? " said Snape curtly . 
Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin , whose smile faded from his eager face . 
" Potter has another hour of Potions to complete , " said Snape coldly . 
" He will come upstairs when this class is finished . " 
" Sir - sir , Mr . Bagman wants him , " he said nervously . 
" All the champions have got to go , I think they want to take photographs . . 
He chanced half a glance at Ron , but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling . 
" Very well , very well , " Snape snapped . 
" Potter , leave your things here , I want you back down here later to test your antidote . " 
" All the champions ... " " Very well ! " said Snape . 
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder , got up , and headed for the door . 
" It's amazing , isn't it , Harry ? " said Colin , starting to speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him . 
You being champion ? " 
" Yeah , really amazing , " said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall . 
" What do they want photos for , Colin ? " " The Daily Prophet , I think ! " " Great , " said Harry dully . 
" Good luck ! " said Colin when they had reached the right room . 
Harry knocked on the door and entered . 
He was in a fairly small classroom ; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room , leaving a large space in the middle ; three of them , however , had been placed end - to - end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet . 
Five chairs had been set behind the velvet - covered desks , and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them , talking to a witch Harry had never seen before , who was wearing magenta robes . 
Fheur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far ; she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light . 
A paunchy man , holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly , was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye . 
" Ah , here he is ! 
In you come , Harry , in you come .. . 
nothing to worry about , it's just the wand weighing ceremony , the rest of the judges will be here in a moment - " " Wand weighing ? " 
Harry repeated nervously . 
" She's doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet . 
" Maybe not that small , Ludo , " said Rita Skeeter , her eyes on Harry . 
" I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start ? " 
she said to Bagman , but still gazing fixedly at Harry . 
" The youngest champion , you know . . . to add a bit of color ? " " Certainly ! " cried Bagman . 
" Er - " said Harry . 
" Lovely , " said Rita Skeeter , and in a second , her scarlet - taloned fingers had Harry's upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip , and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door . 
" Let's see . . . 
It was a broom cupboard . 
Harry stared at her . 
" Let's see now . 
She unsnapped her crocodile - skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles , which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair , so that they could see what they were doing . 
It leaves me free to talk to you normally . 
.. " " A what ? " said Harry . 
Rita Skeeter's smile widened . 
Harry counted three gold teeth . 
She reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid - green quill and a roll of parchment , which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs . Skower's AllPurpose Magical Mess Remover . 
She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth , sucked it for a moment with apparent relish , then placed it upright on the parchment , where it stood balanced on its point , quivering slightly . 
my name is Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter . " 
Harry hooked down quickly at the quill . 
The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken , the green quill had started to scribble , skidding across the parchment : Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter , forty - three , who's savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations " Lovely , " said Rita Skeeter , yet again , and she ripped the top piece of parchment off , crumpled it up , and stuffed it into her handbag . 
Now she leaned toward Harry and said , " So , Harry ... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament ? " " Er - " said Harry again , but he was distracted by the quill . 
Even though he wasn't speaking , it was dashing across the parchment , and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence : An ugly scar , souvenier of a tragic past , disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter , whose eyes - " Ignore the quill , Harry , " said Rita Skeeter firmly . 
Reluctantly Harry looked up at her instead . 
" Now -- why did you decide to enter the tournament , Harry ? " " I didn't , " said Harry . 
" I don't know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire . 
I didn't put it in there . " 
Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow . 
" Come now , Harry , there's no need to be scared of getting into trouble . 
We all know you shouldn't really have entered at all . 
But don't worry about that . 
" But I didn't enter , " Harry repeated . 
" I don't know who - " " How do you feel about the tasks ahead ? " said Rita Skeeter . 
yeah , nervous , I suppose , " said Harry . 
" Have you thought about that at all ? " " Well . . . 
they say it's going to be a lot safer this year , " said Harry . 
" Of course , you ' ve looked death in the face before , haven't you ? " said Rita Skeeter , watching him closely . 
" How would you say that's affected you ? " " Er , " said Harry , yet again . 
" Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself ? 
Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because - " " I didn't enter , " said Harry , starting to feel irritated . 
" No , " said Harry . 
" How do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament ? 
Proud ? 
Angry ? " 
How on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive ? 
He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him very intently . 
Frowning , he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just written : Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember . 
" I have NOT got tears in my eyes ! " said Harry loudly . 
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word , the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open . 
Harry looked around , blinking in the bright light . 
Albus Dumbledore stood there , looking down at both of them , squashed into the cupboard . 
" Dumbledore ! " 
cried Rita Skeeter , with every appearance of delight - but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover , and Rita's clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile - skin bag . 
" How are you ? " 
" I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards ' Conference ? " " Enchantingly nasty , " said Dumbledore , his eyes twinkling . 
" I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old - fashioned , Dumbhedore , and that many wizards in the street - " " I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness , Rita , " said Dumbledore , with a courteous bow and a smile , " but I'm afraid we will have to discuss the matter later . 
The Weighing of the Wands is about to start , and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard . " 
Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter , Harry hurried back into the room . 
The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door , and he sat down quickly next to Cedric , hooking up at the velvet - covered table , where four of the five judges were now sitting - Professor Karkaroff , Madame Maxime , Mr . Crouch , and Ludo Bagman . 
Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner ; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again , spread it on her knee , suck the end of the Quick - Quotes Quill , and place it once more on the parchment . 
" May I introduce Mr . Ollivander ? " said Dumbledore , taking his place at the judges ' table and talking to the champions . 
" He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament . " 
Harry hooked around , and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large , pale eyes standing quietly by the window . 
Harry had met Mr . Ollivander before he was the wand - maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley . 
" Mademoiselle Delacour , could we have you first , please ? " said Mr . Ollivander , stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room . 
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr . Olhivander and handed him her wand . 
" Hmm ... " he said . 
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks . 
Then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefully . 
" Yes , " he said quietly , " nine and a half inches . . . 
and containing . . . 
dear me . . 
" One of my grandmuzzer's . " 
then he remembered that Ron wasn't speaking to him . 
" Yes , " said Mr . Ollivander , " yes , I ' ve never used veela hair myself , of course . 
I find it makes for rather temperamental wands ... however , to each his own , and if this suits you .. " Mr . Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand , apparently checking for scratches or bumps ; then he muttered , " Orchideous ! " and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip . 
" Mr . 
Diggory , you next . " 
Fleur glided back to her seat , smiling at Cedric as he passed her . 
" Yes , I remember it well . 
Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn . . . 
It's in fine condition ... You treat it regularly ? " 
" Polished it last night , " said Cedric , grinning . 
Harry hooked down at his own wand . 
He could see finger marks all over it . 
Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it . 
Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look , and he desisted . 
Mr . Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric's wand , pronounced himself satisfied , and then said , " Mr . 
Krum , if you please . " 
He thrust out his wand and stood scowling , with his hands in the pockets of his robes . 
" Hmm , " said Mr . Olhivander , " this is a Gregorovitch creation , unless I'm much mistaken ? 
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely , turning it over and over before his eyes . 
" Yes .. . 
ten and a quarter inches . . . 
Avis ! " The hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun , and a number of small , twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight . 
" Good , " said Mr . Ollivander , handing Krum back his wand . 
Mr . Potter . " 
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr . Ollivander . 
He handed over his wand . 
" Yes , yes , yes . 
How well I remember . " 
Harry could remember too . 
He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday .... Four summers ago , on his eleventh birthday , he had entered Mr . Ollivander's shop with Hagrid to buy a wand . 
Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop , until at last he had found the one that suited him - this one , which was made of holly , eleven inches long , and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix . 
Mr . Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand . 
" Curious , " he had said , " curious , " and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr . Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort's . 
Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody . 
He was very fond of his wand , and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to Aunt Petunia . 
Mr . Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry's wand than anyone else's . 
Eventually , however , he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it , and handed it back to Harry , announcing that it was still in perfect condition . 
" Thank you all , " said Dumbledore , standing up at the judges ' table . 
" You may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner , as they are about to end - " Feeling that at last something had gone right today , Harry got up to leave , but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat . 
" And then perhaps some individual shots . " 
The photographs took a long time . 
Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood , and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back to get her into the frame ; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her . Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl ; Krum , whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing , skulked , half - hidden , at the back of the group . 
The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front , but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence . 
Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions . 
Harry went down to dinner . 
He ate alone at the end of the table , then returned to Gryffindor Tower , thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do . 
Up in the dormitory , he came across Ron . 
" You ' ve had an owl , " said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in . 
He was pointing at Harry's pillow . 
The school barn owl was waiting for him there . 
" Oh - right , " said Harry . 
He then walked straight out of the room , not looking at Harry . 
For a moment , Harry considered going after him - he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him , both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of Sirius's answer was too strong . 
Harry strode over to the barn owl , took the letter off its leg , and unrolled it . 
Harry I can't say everything I would like to in a letter , it's too risky in case the owl is intercepted - we need to talk face - to - face . 
Can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o ' clock in the morning on the 22 nd ofNovember ? 
I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you ' re around Dumbledore and Moody I don't think anyone will be able to hurt you . 
Be on the watch , Harry . 
I still want to hear about anything unusual . 
Let me know about the 22 nd ofNovember as quickly as you can . 
Sirius 
The prospect of talking face - to - face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over the next fortnight , the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker . 
The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now , and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in . 
Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all ; he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to , and would finish with , the first task . 
Admittedly , he didn't see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people , but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment . 
Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested ; and he and Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question . 
If the worst came to the worst , they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs , but they hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that - Filch would skin them alive . 
In the meantime , life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle , for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament , and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry . 
Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry ; the article ( continuing on pages two , six , and seven ) had been all about Harry , the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions ( misspelled ) had been squashed into the last line of the article , and Cedric hadn't been mentioned at all . 
The article had appeared ten days ago , and Harry still got a sick , burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it . 
I suppose I get my strength from my parents . 
I know they'd be very proud of me if they could see me now . . . . 
Yes , sometimes at night I still cry about them , I'm not ashamed to admit it . . . . 
I know nothing will hurt me during the tournament , because they ' re watching over me . . . 
Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts . 
His close friend , Colin Creevey , says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger , a stunningly pretty Muggle - born girl who , like Harry , is one of the top students in the school . 
From the moment the article had appeared , Harry had had to endure people - Slytherins , mainly -- quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments . 
" Want a hanky , Potter , in case you start crying in Transfiguration ? " " Since when have you been one of the top students in the school , Potter ? 
Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together ? " 
" Hey - Harry ! " " Yeah , that's right ! " 
Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor , having had just about enough . 
" I ' ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum , and I'm just off to do a bit more . . . 
" No - it was just - you dropped your quill . " 
It was Cho . 
Harry felt the color rising in his face . 
good luck on Tuesday , " she said . 
" I really hope you do well . " 
Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid . 
Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too , but she hadn't yet started yelling at innocent bystanders ; in fact , Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation . 
Her ? " Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face - to - face with Hermione after Rita's article had appeared . 
" Ignore it , " Hermione said in a dignified voice , holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn't hear them . 
" Just ignore it , Harry . " 
But Harry couldn't ignore it . 
Ron hadn't spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape's detentions . 
Harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats ' brains in Snape's dungeon , but that had been the day Rita's article had appeared , which seemed to have confirmed Ron's belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention . 
Hermione was furious with the pair of them ; she went from one to the other , trying to force them to talk to each other , but Harry was adamant : He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar . 
" I didn't start this , " Harry said stubbornly . 
" It's his problem . " 
" You miss him ! " 
Hermione said impatiently . 
But this was a downright lie . 
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too , and Harry wondered what he was up to . 
Was he studying , or was he looking for things to help him through the first task ? 
Hermione often complained about Krum being there - not that he ever bothered them - but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves , and Hermione found the noise distracting . 
" He's not even good - looking ! " 
she muttered angrily , glaring at Krum's sharp profile . 
" They only like him because he's famous ! 
It is a strange thing , but when you are dreading something , and would give anything to slow down time , it has a disobliging habit of speeding up . 
The days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed . 
Harry's feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went , as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet article . 
On the Saturday before the first task , all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade . 
Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit , and Harry didn't need much persuasion . 
" What about Ron , though ? " he said . 
" Don't you want to go with him ? " 
" Oh . . . 
well .. . " 
Hermione went slightly pink . 
" I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks . . . 
. " " No , " said Harry flatly . 
" Oh Harry , this is so stupid - " 
" I ' ll come , but I'm not meeting Ron , and I'm wearing my Invisibility Cloak . " 
" Oh all right then . . 
Hermione snapped , " but I hate talking to you in that cloak , I never know if I'm looking at you or not . " 
So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory , went back downstairs , and together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade . 
Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak ; he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village , most of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory ! badges , but no horrible remarks came his way for a change , and nobody was quoting that stupid article . 
" They think I'm talking to myself . " 
" Don't move your lips so much then . " 
" Come on , please just take off your cloak for a bit , no one's going to bother you here . " 
" Oh yeah ? " said Harry . 
" Look behind you . " 
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub . 
When they were gone , Harry said , " She's staying in the village . 
I bet she's coming to watch the first task . " 
As he said it , his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic . 
" She's gone , " said Hermione , looking right through Harry toward the end of the street . 
You don't have to talk to Ron ! " she added irritably , correctly interpreting his silence . 
The Three Broomsticks was packed , mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon , but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else . 
Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all - wizard village in Britain , it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags , who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves . 
It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak , in case you accidentally trod on someone , which tended to lead to awkward questions . 
Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks . 
On his way through the pub , Harry spotted Ron , who was sitting with Fred , George , and Lee Jordan . 
Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head , he finally reached the table and sat down at it . 
" Lucky I brought something to do . " 
And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of S . P . E . W . members . 
Harry saw his and Ron's names at the top of the very short list . 
It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together , and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer . 
" Yeah , right , " said Harry . 
" You know , I'm starting to think it's time for more direct action . 
I wonder how you get into the school kitchens ? " 
" No idea , ask Fred and George , " said Harry . 
Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence , while Harry drank his butterbeer , watching the people in the pub . 
All of them looked cheerful and relaxed . 
Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table ; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory ! badges on their cloaks . 
Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends . 
What wouldn't he have given to be one of these peophe , sitting around laughing and talking , with nothing to worry about but homework ? 
He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn't come out of the Goblet of Fire . 
Ron would be sitting with him . 
The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday . 
He'd have been really hooking forward to it , watching them do whatever it was ... cheering on Cedric with everyone else , safe in a seat at the back of the stands ... 
He wondered how the other champions were feeling . 
Every time he had seen Cedric lately , he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited . 
And Krum just sat in the library , poring over books . 
Harry thought of Sirius , and the tight , tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly . 
Harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at once , as Hagrid was so large , but standing up carefully , he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low , talking to Professor Moody . 
Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead , but Harry knew better . 
Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times , as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup . 
As Harry watched , he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave . 
He waved , then remembered that Hagrid couldn't see him . 
Moody , however , paused , his magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing . 
He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back ( being unable to reach his shoulder ) , muttered something to him , and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione's table . 
" All right , Hermione ? " said Hagrid loudly . 
" Hello , " said Hermione , smiling back . 
Moody limped around the table and bent down ; Harry thought he was reading the S . P . E . W . notebook , until he muttered , " Nice cloak , Potter . " 
Harry stared at him in amazement . 
The large chunk missing from Moody's nose was particularly obvious at a few inches'distance . 
Moody grinned . 
" Can your eye - I mean , can you - ? " " Yeah , it can see through Invisibility Cloaks , " Moody said quietly . 
" And it's come in useful at times , I can tell you . " 
Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too . 
Harry knew Hagrid couldn't see him , but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there . 
Straightening up , Hagrid said loudly , " Nice ter see yeh , Hermione , " winked , and departed . 
Moody followed him . 
" Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight ? " 
Harry said , very surprised . 
" Does he ? " said Hermione , looking startled . 
" I wonder what he's up to ? 
I don't know whether you should go , Harry . . . 
It was true that going down to Hagrid's at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed ; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid's to tell him he couldn't go - always assuming she would consent to take the note , of course - Harry , however , thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for . 
He was very curious to know what this might be ; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night . 
At half past eleven that evening , Harry , who had pretended to go up to bed early , pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room . 
The Creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory ! badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter ! instead . 
Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so , keeping an eye on his watch . 
Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned . 
He slipped past her with a whispered " Thanks ! " and set off through the castle . 
The grounds were very dark . 
Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid's cabin . 
The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up ; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid's front door . 
" You there , Harry ? " Hagrid whispered , opening the door and looking around . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head . 
He was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole . 
It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease , but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair Harry could see the comb's broken teeth tangled in it . 
" What ' re you showing me ? " 
Harry said warily , wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs , or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three - headed dog off a stranger in a pub . 
" Listen , Hagrid , I can't stay long . . . . 
But Hagrid wasn't listening ; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night . 
Harry hurried to follow and found , to his great surprise , that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage . 
" Hagrid , what - ? " " Shhh ! " said Hagrid , and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands . 
Madame Maxime opened it . 
She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders . 
She smiled when she saw Hagrid . 
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her , Hagrid offered her his arm , and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime's giant winged horses , with Harry , totally bewildered , running to keep up with them . 
Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime ? 
" Of course not , " said Madame Maxime , fluttering her long black eyelashes . 
If they didn't get there soon , he was going to turn around , go straight back to the castle , and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime . 
But then - when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight - Harry heard something . 
Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt . 
Harry hurried up alongside them - for a split second , he thought he was seeing bonfires , and men darting around them - and then his mouth fell open . 
There was a silvery - blue one with long , pointed horns , snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground ; a smooth - scaled green one , which was writhing and stamping with all its might ; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face , which was shooting mushroom - shaped fire clouds into the air ; and a gigantic black one , more lizardhike than the others , which was nearest to them . 
At least thirty wizards , seven or eight to each dragon , were attempting to control them , pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs . 
Mesmerized , Harry looked up , high above him , and saw the eyes of the black dragon , with vertical pupils like a cat's , bulging with either fear or rage , he couldn't tell which . . . . 
It was making a horrible noise , a yowling , screeching scream . 
" Keep back there , Hagrid ! " yelled a wizard near the fence , straining on the chain he was holding . 
" Is ' n ' it beautiful ? " said Hagrid softly . 
" It's no good ! " 
" Stunning Spells , on the count of three ! " 
Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand . 
" Stupefy ! " 
they shouted in unison , and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets , bursting in showers of stars on the dragons'scaly hides Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs ; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl ; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame , though still smoking - then , very slowly , it fell . 
Several tons of sinewy , scalyblack dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake . 
The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges , each of which was the size of a small hill . 
They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs , which they forced deep into the ground with their wands . 
" Wan ' a closer look ? " Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly . 
The pair of them moved right up to the fence , and Harry followed . 
The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned , and Harry realized who it was : Charlie Weasley . 
" All right , Hagrid ? " he panted , coming over to talk . 
" They should be okay now we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on the way here , thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet - but , like you saw , they weren't happy , not happy at all - " " What breeds you got here , Charlie ? " said Hagrid , gazing at the closest dragon , the black one , with something chose to reverence . 
Its eyes were still just open . 
" This is a Hungarian Horntail , " said Charlie . 
" There's a Common Welsh Green over there , the smaller one -- a Swedish Short - Snout , that blue - gray -- and a Chinese Fireball , that's the red . " 
Charlie looked around ; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure , gazing at the stunned dragons . 
" Really romantic date , Hagrid , " said Charlie , shaking his head . 
. " said Hagrid , " so it's one fer each o ' the champions , is it ? 
but I tell you this , I don't envy the one who gets the Horntail . 
Its back end's as dangerous as its front , look . " 
Five of Charlie's fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment , carrying a clutch of huge granite - gray eggs between them in a blanket . 
They placed them carefully at the Horntail's side . 
Hagrid let out a moan of longing . 
" I ' ve got them counted , Hagrid , " said Charlie sternly . 
Then he said , " How's Harry ? " " Fine , " said Hagrid . 
He was still gazing at the eggs . 
I thought they were all safe , I thought there was going to be an age limit ! ' 
Oh bless him , I never knew ! " 
Harry had had enough . 
Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn't miss him , with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him , he turned silently and began to walk away , back to the castle . 
He didn't know whether he was glad he'd seen what was coming or not . 
The first shock was over now . 
Maybe if he'd seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday , he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school . . . 
And he had to get past it . 
How ? 
Harry sped up , skirting the edge of the forest ; he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius , and he couldn't remember , ever , wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now -- when , without warning , he ran into something very solid . 
Harry fell backward , his glasses askew , clutching the cloak around him . 
Who's there ? " 
Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still , staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit . 
He recognized the goatee . . . it was Karkaroff . 
Harry remained still and silent . 
Then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were . 
Very slowly and very carefully , Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise , hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts . 
He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to . 
He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be . 
He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together - they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance . . . 
and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices , and he , like Madame Maxime , would know what was in store for the champions . 
By the looks of it , the only champion who would be facing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric . 
Harry reached the castle , slipped in through the front doors , and began to climb the marble stairs ; he was very out of breath , but he didn't dare slow down . . . . 
He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire . 
" Balderdash ! " he gasped at the Fat Lady , who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole . 
Harry climbed inside . 
The common room was deserted , and , judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal , Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy . 
Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire . 
The room was in semidarkness ; the flames were the only source of light . 
Nearby , on a table , the Support Cedric Diggory ! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight . 
Harry looked back into the flames , and jumped . 
Sirius's head was sitting in the fire . 
If Harry hadn't seen Mr . Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys ' kitchen , it would have scared him out of his wits . 
When they had said goodbye , Sirius's face had been gaunt and sunken , surrounded by a quantity of long , black , matted hair - but the hair was short and clean now , Sirius's face was fuller , and he looked younger , much more like the only photograph Harry had of him , which had been taken at the Potters ' wedding . 
" Never mind me , how are you ? " said Sirius seriously . 
Before he could stop himself , he was talking more than he'd talked in days - about how no one believed he hadn't entered the tournament of his own free will , how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet , how he couldn't walk down a corridor without being sneered at - and about Ron , Ron not believing him , Ron's jealousy ... " . . . 
There are things I need to warn you about . " 
" Karkaroff , " said Sirius . 
" Harry , he was a Death Eater . 
You know what Death Eaters are , don't you ? " " Yes - he - what ? " " He was caught , he was in Azkaban with me , but he got released . 
Moody caught Karkaroff . 
" Karkaroff got released ? " 
Harry said slowly - his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information . 
" Why did they release him ? " 
" He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic , " said Sirius bitterly . 
" He said he'd seen the error of his ways , and then he named names . . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place . . . . 
He's not very popular in there , I can tell you . 
And since he got out , from what I can tell , he's been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his . 
" Okay , " said Harry slowly . 
" But . . . 
are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet ? 
Because if he did , he's a really good actor . 
He seemed furious about it . 
He wanted to stop me from competing . " 
" We know he's a good actor , " said Sirius , " because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free , didn't he ? 
Now , I ' ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet , Harry .. " " - you and the rest of the world , " said Harry bitterly . 
" - and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman's article last month , Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts . 
Yes , I know she says it was another false alarm , " Sirius said hastily , seeing Harry about to speak , " but I don't think so , somehow . 
I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts . 
I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around . 
Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had . " " So . . . 
what are you saying ? " said Harry slowly . 
" Karkaroff's trying to kill me ? 
But - why ? " Sirius hesitated . 
" I ' ve been nearing some very strange things , " he said slowly . 
They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup , didn't they ? 
it's not very likely she'd have walked straight into Voldemort , is it ? " 
said Harry . 
" Listen , I knew Bertha Jorkins , " said Sirius grimly . 
Very nosy , but no brains , none at all . 
It's not a good combination , Harry . 
" So . . . 
so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament ? " said Harry . 
" Is that what you mean ? 
" I don't know , " said Sirius slowly , " I just don't know ... Karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him . 
But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason , and I can't help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accident . " 
" They ' ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff . " 
" Right - these dragons , " said Sirius , speaking very quickly now . 
" There's a way , Harry . 
Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell - dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner , you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon - " " Yeah , I know , I just saw , " said Harry . 
" But you can do it alone , " said Sirius . 
" There is away , and a simple spell's all you need . 
Just - " But Harry held up a hand to silence him , his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst . 
He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him . 
Harry scrambled to his feet , hiding the fire - if someone saw Sirius's face within the walls of Hogwarts , they would raise an almighty uproar - the Ministry would get dragged in - he , Harry , would be questioned about Sirius's whereabouts Harry heard a tiny pop ! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone . 
He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase . 
Who had decided to go for a stroll at one o ' clock in the morning , and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon ? 
It was Ron . 
Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas , Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room , and looked around . 
" Who were you talking to ? " he said . 
" What's that got to do with you ? " 
Harry snarled . 
" What are you doing down here at this time of night ? " 
" I just wondered where you - " Ron broke off , shrugging . 
I'm going back to bed . " " Just thought you'd come nosing around , did you ? " 
Harry shouted . 
" Sorry about that , " said Ron , his face reddening with anger . 
" Should ' ve realized you didn't want to be disturbed . 
I ' ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace . " 
Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it , as hard as he could , across the room . 
It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off . 
" There you go , " Harry said . 
You might even have a scar now , if yon ' re lucky .. . . 
That's what you want , isn't it ? " 
He strode across the room toward the stairs ; he half expected Ron to stop him , he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him , but Ron just stood there in his too - small pajamas , and Harry , having stormed upstairs , lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didn't hear him come up to bed . 
Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock . 
When he'd finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body , he hurried off to find Hermione , locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall , where she was eating breakfast with Ginny . 
Feeling too queasy to eat , Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge , then dragged her out onto the grounds . 
There , he told her all about the dragons , and about everything Sirius had said , while they took another long walk around the lake . 
Alarmed as she was by Sirius's warnings about Karkaroff , Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem . 
" Let's just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening , " she said desperately , " and then we can worry about Karkaroff . " 
They walked three times around the lake , trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon . 
Nothing whatsoever occurred to them , so they retired to the library instead . 
Here , Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons , and both of them set to work searching through the large pile . 
This is no good , this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy . 
.. " Dragons are extremely difficult to slay , owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides , which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate . . 
But Sirius said a simple one would do it .. . 
He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks , set them down , and began to flick through each in turn , Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow . 
but what's the point of Switching it ? 
The trouble is , like that book said , not much is going to get through a dragon's hide . . . . 
I'd say Transfigure it , but something that big , you really haven't got a hope , I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . 
. " " Hermione , " Harry said , through gritted teeth , " will you shut up for a bit , please ? 
I m trying to concentrate . " 
But all that happened , when Hermione fell silent , was that Harry's brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing , which didn't seem to allow room for concentration . 
He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed . 
just what he needed , to give it an extra weapon ... " Oh no , he's back again , why can't he read on his stupid ship ? " said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in , cast a surly look over at the pair of them , and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books . 
" Come on , Harry , we ' ll go back to the common room . . . 
And sure enough , as they left the library , a gang of girls tiptoed past them , one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist . 
Harry barely slept that night . 
When he awoke on Monday morning , he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts . 
But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time , and thought about what leaving the castle would mean , he knew he couldn't do it . 
It was the only place he had ever been happy . . . 
well , he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too , but he couldn't remember that . 
Somehow , the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know ; it made him feel slightly calmer . 
Cedric still didn't know about the dragons . . . the only champion who didn't , if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum .... " Hermione , I ' ll see you in the greenhouses , " Harry said , coming to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall . 
" Go on , I ' ll catch you up . " " Harry , you ' ll be late , the bell's about to ring - " " I ' ll catch you up , okay ? " 
By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase , Cedric was at the top . 
He was with a load of sixth - year friends . 
Harry didn't want to talk to Cedric in front of them ; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter's article at him every time he went near them . 
He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor . 
Pausing at a distance from them , he pulled out his wand , and took careful aim . 
" Diffindo ! " 
Parchment , quills , and books spilled out of it onto the floor . 
" Tell Flitwick I'm coming , go on . . . 
This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for . 
" Hi , " said Cedric , picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink . 
brand - new and all . . 
. " " Cedric , " said Harry , " the first task is dragons . " 
" Dragons , " said Harry , speaking quickly , in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to . 
" They ' ve got four , one for each of us , and we ' ve got to get past them . " 
Cedric stared at him . 
Harry saw some of the panic he'd been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric's gray eyes . 
" Are you sure ? " Cedric said in a hushed voice . 
" Dead sure , " said Harry . 
" I ' ve seen them . " 
" But how did you find out ? 
We're not supposed to know . . . 
. " " Never mind , " said Harry quickly - he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth . 
" But I'm not the only one who knows . 
Fleur and Krum will know by now - Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too . " 
Cedric straightened up , his arms full of inky quills , parchment , and books , his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder . 
He stared at Harry , and there was a puzzled , almost suspicious look in his eyes . 
" Why are you telling me ? " he asked . 
Harry looked at him in disbelief . 
He was sure Cedric wouldn't have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself . 
" We all know now . . . 
He turned around and saw Mad - Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom . 
" Come with me , Potter , " he growled . 
Harry stared apprehensively at Moody . 
In my office , please ... Harry followed him , wondering what was going to happen to him now . 
What if Moody wanted to know how he'd found out about the dragons ? 
Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid , or just turn Harry into a ferret ? 
Well , it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret , Harry thought dully , he'd be smaller , much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet .. 
He followed Moody into his office . 
Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry , his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one . 
" That was a very decent thing you just did , Potter , " Moody said quietly . 
" Sit down , " said Moody , and Harry sat , looking around . 
He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants . 
In Professor Lockhart's day , the walls had been plastered with beaming , winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself . 
Now , however , the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror . 
On his desk stood what looked hike a large , cracked , glass spinning top ; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope , because he owned one himself , though it was much smaller than Moody's . 
In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra - squiggly , golden television aerial . 
It was humming slightly . 
What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall , but it was not reflecting the room . 
" Like my Dark Detectors , do you ? " 
s aid Moody , who was watching Harry closely . 
" What's that ? " 
Harry asked , pointing at the squiggly golden aerial . 
It's extra - sensitive , picks up stuff about a mile around . 
" And what's the mirror for ? " " Oh that's my Foe - Glass . 
I'm not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes . 
He let out a short , harsh laugh , and pointed to the large trunk under the window . 
It had seven keyholes in a row . 
Harry wondered what was in there , until Moody's next question brought him sharply back to earth . 
" So . . . 
Harry hesitated . 
He'd been afraid of this - but he hadn't told Cedric , and he certainly wasn't going to tell Moody , that Hagrid had broken the rules . 
" It's all right , " said Moody , sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan . 
" Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been . " 
" I didn't cheat , " said Harry sharply . 
" It was - a sort of accident that I found out . " 
Moody grinned . 
" I wasn't accusing you , laddie . 
They want to win . 
They want to beat Dumbledore . 
" No , " said Harry . 
" Well , I'm not going to tell you , " said Moody gruffly . 
I'm just going to give you some good , general advice . 
And the first bit is - play to your strengths . " 
What are you best at ? " Harry tried to concentrate . 
What was he best at ? 
" Yeah , but .. . " 
Harry stared at him . 
" I'm not allowed a broom , I ' ve only got my wand ... " 
" My second piece of general advice , " said Moody loudly , interrupting him , " is to use a nice , simple spell that will enable you to get what you need . " 
Harry looked at him blankly . 
What did he need ? 
" Come on , boy . . 
. " whispered Moody . 
" Put them together ... it's not that difficult ... " And it clicked . 
He was best at flying . 
He needed to pass the dragon in the air . 
For that , he needed his Firebolt . 
And for his Fire - bolt , he needed " Hermione , " Harry whispered , when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later , uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her . 
" Hermione I need you to help me . " 
" Hermione , I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon . " 
And so they practiced . 
They didn't have lunch , but headed for a free classroom , where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him . 
He was still having problems . 
The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor . 
" Concentrate , Harry , concentrate . . . 
. " " What d ' you think I'm trying to do ? " said Harry angrily . 
He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing , but Hermione refused pointblank to skive off Arithmancy , and there was no point in staying without her . 
He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney , who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden , violent deaths . 
" Well , that's good , " said Harry loudly , his temper getting the better of him , " just as long as it's not drawn - out . 
I don't want to suffer . " 
Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh ; he certainly caught Harry's eye for the first time in days , but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care . 
He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand . 
He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand , though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid . 
He forced down some dinner after Divination , then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione , using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers . 
Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch , and went back to the Gryffindor common room , which was now mercifully empty . 
At two o ' clock in the morning , Harry stood near the fireplace , surrounded by heaps of objects : books , quills , several upturned chairs , an old set of Gobstones , and Neville's toad , Trevor . 
Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm . 
" That's better , Harry , that's loads better , " Hermione said , looking exhausted but very pleased . 
" Well , now we know what to do next time I can't manage a spell , " Harry said , throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione , so he could try again , " threaten me with a dragon . 
He raised his wand once more . 
" Accio Dictionary ! " 
The heavy book soared out of Hermione's hand , flew across the room , and Harry caught it . 
" Harry , I really think you ' ve got it ! " said Hermione delightedly . 
" The Firebolt's going to be much farther away than the stuff in here , it's going to be in the castle , and I'm going to be out there on the grounds . . . 
. " " That doesn't matter , " said Hermione firmly . " 
Just as long as you ' re concentrating really , really hard on it , it ' ll come . 
you ' re going to need it . " 
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him . 
The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement . 
Lessons were to stop at midday , giving all the students time to get down to the dragons ' enclosure - though of course , they didn't yet know what they would find there . 
It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon , and start trying to curse everyone in sight . 
and then ( where had the morning gone ? 
the last of the dragon - free hours ? ) , Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall . 
" Potter , the champions have to come down onto the grounds now ... . 
You have to get ready for your first task . " 
" Okay , " said Harry , standing up , his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter . 
" Good luck , Harry , " Hermione whispered . 
" You ' ll be fine ! " 
" Yeah , " said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own . 
He heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall . 
As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon , she put her hand on his shoulder . 
The main thing is just to do your best , and nobody will think any the worse of you . . . . 
Are you all right ? " 
" Yes , " Harry heard himself say . 
" Yes , I'm fine . " 
She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were , around the edge of the forest , but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible , Harry saw that a tent had been erected , its entrance facing them , screening the dragons from view . 
" You ' re to go in here with the other champions , " said Professor McGonagall , in a rather shaky sort of voice , " and wait for your turn , Potter . 
Mr . Bagman is in there . . . 
he ' ll be telling you the - the procedure . . . . 
Good luck . " 
" Thanks , " said Harry , in a flat , distant voice . 
She left him at the entrance of the tent . 
Harry went inside . 
Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool . 
She didn't look nearly as composed as usual , but rather pale and clammy . 
" Harry ! 
Good - o ! " said Bagman happily , looking around at him . 
He was wearing his old Wasp robes again . 
" When the audience has assembled , I'm going to be offering each of you this bag " - he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them - " from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face ! 
There are different - er varieties , you see . 
And I have to tell you something else too .. . 
ah , yes ... your task is to collect the golden egg ! " Harry glanced around . 
Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn't reacted at all . 
Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths ; that was certainly how Harry felt . 
But they , at least , had volunteered for this . . 
Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species . 
And then - it seemed like about a second later to Harry - Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack . 
" Ladies first , " he said , offering it to Fleur Delacour . 
She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny , perfect model of a dragon - a Welsh Green . 
It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew , by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise , but rather a determined resignation , that he had been right : Madame Maxime had told her what was coming . 
He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball . 
He didn't even blink , just sat back down and stared at the ground . 
Cedric put his hand into the bag , and out came the blueish - gray Swedish ShortSnout , the number one tied around its neck . 
Knowing what was left , Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail , and the number four . 
" Well , there you are ! " said Bagman . 
" You have each pulled out the dragon you will face , and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons , do you see ? 
Now , I'm going to have to leave you in a moment , because I'm commentating . 
Mr . Diggory , you ' re first , just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle , all right ? 
Now . . . 
Harry . . . 
could I have a quick word ? 
yes , " said Harry blankly , and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman , who walked him a short distance away , into the trees , and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face . 
" Feeling all right , Harry ? 
Anything I can get you ? " " What ? " said Harry . 
" I - no , nothing . " 
" Got a plan ? " said Bagman , lowering his voice conspiratorially . 
" Because I don't mind sharing a few pointers , if you'd like them , you know . 
Anything I can do to help . . 
. " " No , " said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude , " no - I - I know what I'm going to do , thanks . " 
" Nobody would know , Harry , " said Bagman , winking at him . 
" I ' ve got a plan worked out , I - " A whistle had blown somewhere . 
Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it , greener than ever . 
Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past , but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt . 
Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum . 
Seconds hater , they heard the roar of the crowd , which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face - toface with the living counterpart of his model . 
The crowd screamed . . . 
yelled .. . 
Krum was still staring at the ground . 
Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric's steps , around and around the tent . 
And then , after about fifteen minutes , Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing : Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg . 
" Very good indeed ! " 
Bagman was shouting . 
" And now the marks from the judges ! " 
But he didn't shout out the marks ; Harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd . 
" Miss Delacour , if you please ! " Fleur was trembling from head to foot ; Harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand . 
He and Krum were left alone , at opposite sides of the tent , avoiding each other's gaze . 
. " Oh 
I'm not sure that was wise ! " they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully . 
" Oh . . . 
Ten minutes later , Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more . . . . 
Fleur must have been successful too . 
then , for the third time , the whistle . 
" And here comes Mr . Krum ! " cried Bagman , and Krum slouched out , leaving Harry quite alone . 
He felt much more aware of his body than usual ; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast , and his fingers tingling with fear . . . 
yet at the same time , he seemed to be outside himself , seeing the walls of the tent , and hearing the crowd , as though from far away . 
" Very daring ! " 
Bagman was yelling , and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible , roaring shriek , while the crowd drew its collective breath . 
" That's some nerve he's showing - and - yes , he's got the egg ! " Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass ; Krum had finished - it would be Harry's turn any moment . 
He stood up , noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow . 
He waited . 
And then he heard the whistle blow . 
He walked out through the entrance of the tent , the panic rising into a crescendo inside him . 
And now he was walking past the trees , through a gap in the enclosure fence . 
He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream . 
There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot . 
And there was the Horntail , at the other end of the enclosure , crouched low over her clutch of eggs , her wings half - furled , her evil , yellow eyes upon him , a monstrous , scaly , black lizard , thrashing her spiked tail , heaving yard - long gouge marks in the hard ground . 
It was time to do what he had to do . . . to focus his mind , entirely and absolutely , upon the thing that was his only chance . 
He raised his wand . 
He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering , transparent barrier , like a heat haze , which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely .... 
And then he heard it , speeding through the air behind him ; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods , soaring into the enclosure , and stopping dead in midair beside him , waiting for him to mount . 
Bagman was shouting something . . . 
He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground . 
As he soared upward , as the wind rushed through his hair , as the crowd's faces became mere flesh - colored pinpnicks below , and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog , he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind , but also his fear . . . . 
This was just another Quidditch match , that was all . . . 
just another Quidditch match , and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team . 
He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one , gleaming against its cement - colored fellows , residing safely between the dragon's front legs . 
let's go . . 
He dived . 
The Horntail's head followed him ; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time ; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away . . . 
" Great Scott , he can fly ! " yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped . 
" Are you watching this , Mr . Krum ? " 
Harry soared higher in a circle ; the Horntail was still following his progress ; its head revolving on its long neck - if he kept this up , it would be nicely dizzy - but better not push it too long , or it would be breathing fire again Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth , but this time he was less lucky - he missed the flames , but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead , and as he swerved to the left , one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder , ripping his robes - He could feel it stinging , he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd , but the cut didn't seem to be deep . . . . 
Now he zoomed around the back of the Horntail , and a possibility occurred to him .... 
but he had to persuade her to do it , or he'd never get near them . . . . 
The trick was to do it carefully , gradually .... 
He began to fly , first this way , then the other , not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off , but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him . 
Harry rose a few more feet , and she let out a roar of exasperation . 
He was like a fly to her , a fly she was longing to swat ; her tail thrashed again , but he was too high to reach now . . . . 
Her jaws opened wide .... " Come on , " Harry hissed , swerving tantalizingly above her , " come on , come and get me . . . up you get now . 
Before the dragon knew what he had done , or where he had disappeared to , he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go , toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs - he had taken his hands off his Firebolt - he had seized the golden egg And with a huge spurt of speed , he was off , he was soaring out over the stands , the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm , and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up - for the first time , he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd , which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup " Look at that ! " Bagman was yelling . 
" Will you look at that ! 
Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail , and , over at the entrance to the enclosure , Professor McGonagalh , Professor Moody , and Hagrid hurrying to meet him , all of them waving him toward them , their smiles evident even from this distance . 
He flew back over the stands , the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums , and came in smoothly to land , his heart lighter than it had been in weeks . . . . 
" That was excellent , Potter ! " cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt - which from her was extravagant praise . 
He noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder . 
. " " Yeh did it , Harry ! " said Hagrid hoarsely . 
" Yeh did it ! 
An ' agains ' the Horntail an ' all , an ' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors ' - " " Thanks , Hagrid , " said Harry loudly , so that Hagrid wouldn't blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand . 
Professor Moody looked very pleased too ; his magical eye was dancing in its socket . 
. " said Professor McGonagall . 
Harry walked out of the enclosure , still panting , and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent , looking worried . 
she said , in a disgusted tone , pulling Harry inside . 
The tent was divided into cubicles ; he could make out Cedric's shadow through the canvas , but Cedric didn't seem to be badly injured ; he was sitting up , at least . 
Madam Pomfrey examined Harry's shoulder , talking furiously all the while . 
" Last year dementors , this year dragons , what are they going to bring into this school next ? 
You ' re very lucky . . . 
this is quite shallow . . . 
it ' ll need cleaning before I heal it up , though ... . " 
" Now , just sit quietly for a minute - sit ! 
And then you can go and get your score . " 
She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say , " How does it feel now , Diggory ? " 
Harry didn't want to sit still : He was too full of adrenaline . 
He got to his feet , wanting to see what was going on outside , but before he'd reached the mouth of the tent , two people had come darting inside - Hermione , followed closely by Ron . 
" Harry , you were brilliant ! " 
Hermione said squeakily . 
" You were amazing ! 
You really were ! " 
But Harry was looking at Ron , who was very white and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost . 
" Harry , " he said , very seriously , " whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I reckon they ' re trying to do you in ! " 
It was as though the last few weeks had never happened - as though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time , right after he'd been made champion . 
" Caught on , have you ? " said Harry coldly . 
Hermione stood nervously between them , looking from one to the other . 
Ron opened his mouth uncertainly . 
Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it . 
" It's okay , " he said , before Ron could get the words out . 
" Forget it . " 
" No , " said Ron , " I shouldn't ' ve - " " Forget it , " Harry said . 
Ron grinned nervously at him , and Harry grinned back Hermione burst into tears . 
Harry told her , bewildered . 
" Barking mad , " said Ron , shaking his head . 
Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt , feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago , Harry ducked out of the tent , Ron by his side , talking fast . 
" You were the best , you know , no competition . 
turned it into a dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him . 
Well , it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration , and it sort of worked , because he did get the egg , but he got burned as well - the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador ; he only just got away . 
And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm , I think she was trying to put it into a trance - well , that kind of worked too , it went all sleepy , but then it snored , and this great jet of flame shot out , and her skirt caught fire - she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand . 
And Krum - you won't believe this , but he didn't even think of flying ! 
He was probably the best after you , though . 
Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye . 
Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure . 
Now that the Horntail had been taken away , Harry could see where the five judges were sitting right at the other end , in raised seats draped in gold . 
" It's marks out of ten from each one , " Ron said , and Harry squinting up the field , saw the first judge - Madame Maxime - raise her wand in the air . 
What hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it , which twisted itself into a large figure eight . 
" Not bad ! " said Ron as the crowd applauded . 
Mr . Crouch came next . 
He shot a number nine into the air . 
" Looking good ! " Ron yelled , thumping Harry on the back . 
Next , Dumbledore . 
He too put up a nine . 
The crowd was cheering harder than ever . 
Ludo Bagman - ten . 
" Ten ? " said Harry in disbelief . 
" But . . . 
Ron yelled excitedly . 
And now Karkaroff raised his wand . 
He paused for a moment , and then a number shot out of his wand too - four . 
" What ? " 
Ron bellowed furiously . 
He didn't tell Ron this , of course , but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure . 
those weren't only Gryffindors cheering in the crowd . 
You and Krum ! " said Charlie Weasley , hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school . 
" Listen , I ' ve got to run , I ' ve got to go and send Mum an owl , I swore I'd tell her what happened - but that was unbelievable ! 
Oh yeah - and they told me to tell you you ' ve got to hang around for a few more minutes .. . . 
Ron said he would wait , so Harry reentered the tent , which somehow looked quite different now : friendly and welcoming . 
He thought back to how he'd felt while dodging the Horntail , and compared it to the long wait before he'd walked out to face it .... 
Fleur , Cedric , and Krum all came in together . 
One side of Cedric's face was covered in a thick orange paste , which was presumably mending his burn . 
He grinned at Harry when he saw him . 
" Good one , Harry . " 
" And you , " said Harry , grinning back . 
" Well done , all of you ! " said Ludo Bagman , bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon . 
" Now , just a quick few words . 
You ' ve got a nice long break before the second task , which will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty - fourth - but we ' re giving you something to think about in the meantime ! 
If you look down at those golden eggs you ' re all holding , you will see that they open . . . 
see the hinges there ? 
You need to solve the clue inside the egg - because it will tell you what the second task is , and enable you to prepare for it ! 
All clear ? 
Harry left the tent , rejoined Ron , and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest , talking hard ; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail . 
Then , as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar , a witch leapt out from behind them . 
It was Rita Skeeter . 
" Congratulations , Harry ! " she said , beaming at him . 
" I wonder if you could give me a quick word ? 
How you felt facing that dragon ? 
How you feel now , about the fairness of the scoring ? " " Yeah , you can have a word , " said Harry savagely . 
" Good - bye . " 
And he set off back to the castle with Ron . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon , so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed . 
On the way , Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff . 
Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater , by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along . 
" Fits , doesn't it ? " he said . 
" Remember what Malfoy said on the train , about his dad being friends with Karkaroff ? 
Now we know where they knew each other . 
Come here - I ' ll do it - " Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around Harry's head , hooting incessantly . 
Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg . 
" There's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous , how could they be ? " 
Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window . 
" You know what ? 
I reckon you could win this tournament , Harry , I'm serious . " 
Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks , but he appreciated it all the same . 
He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window . 
Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again ; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual - Harry hadn't been able to resist giving Sirius a blow - by - blow account of exactly how he had swerved , circled , and dodged the Horntail . 
They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness , and then Ron said , " Well , we'd better get downstairs for your surprise party , Harry - Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now . " 
There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface ; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster's Fireworks , so that the air was thick with stars and sparks ; and Dean Thomas , who was very good at drawing , had put up some impressive new banners , most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail's head on his Firebolt , though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire . 
Harry helped himself to food ; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry , and sat down with Ron and Hermione . 
He couldn't believe how happy he felt ; he had Ron back on his side , he'd gotten through the first task , and he wouldn't have to face the second one for three months . 
" Blimey , this is heavy , " said Lee Jordan , picking up the golden egg , which Harry had left on a table , and weighing it in his hands . 
" Open it , Harry , go on ! 
Let's just see what's inside it ! " 
" He's supposed to work out the clue on his own , " Hermione said swiftly . 
" It's in the tournament rules . . . 
. " " I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too , " Harry muttered , so only Hermione could hear him , and she grinned rather guiltily . 
" Yeah , go on , Harry , open it ! " 
Lee passed Harry the egg , and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open . 
It was hollow and completely empty - but the moment Harry opened it , the most horrible noise , a loud and screechy wailing , filled the room . 
The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party , who had all been playing the musical saw . 
" Shut it ! " 
Fred bellowed , his hands over his ears . 
" What was that ? " said Seamus Finnigan , staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again . 
" You ' re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse ! " " Don't be a prat , Neville , that's illegal , " said George . 
" They wouldn't use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions . 
Harry . " 
" Want a jam tart , Hermione ? " said Fred . 
Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her . 
Fred grinned . 
" It's all right , " he said . 
" I haven't done anything to them . 
It's the custard creams you ' ve got to watch - " Neville , who had just bitten into a custard cream , choked and spat it out . 
Fred laughed . 
Hermione took a jam tart . 
Then she said , " Did you get all this from the kitchens , Fred ? " " Yep , " said Fred , grinning at her . 
He put on a high - pitched squeak and imitated a house - elf . 
" How do you get in there ? " 
Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice . 
" Easy , " said Fred , " concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit . 
Just tickle the pear , and it giggles and - " He stopped and looked suspiciously at her . " Why ? " " Nothing , " said Hermione quickly . 
" Going to try and lead the house - elves out on strike now , are you ? " said George . 
" Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion ? " 
Hermione didn't answer . 
Just then , Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary . 
" Oh - sorry , Neville ! " Fred shouted over all the laughter . 
" Canary Creams ! " Fred shouted to the excitable crowd . 
It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron , Neville , Seamus , and Dean . 
Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed , where it yawned , curled up , and closed its eyes . 
they were all right , really , dragons . . . . 
Drafty though the castle always was in winter . 
Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake , which was pitching in the high winds , its black sails billowing against the dark skies . 
Hagrid , he noticed , was keeping Madame Maxime's horses well provided with their preferred drink of single - malt whiskey ; the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light - headed . 
" I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not , " Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson . 
Their thick gray armor ; their powerful , scuttling legs ; their fire - blasting ends ; their stings and their suckers , combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen . 
The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out , all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets . 
" We ' ll jus ' lead ' em in here , " Hagrid said , " an ' put the lids on , and we ' ll see what happens . " 
Hagrid was soon yelling , " Don panic , now , don ' panic ! " while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch , now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes . 
Most of the class - Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle in the lead - had fled into Hagrid's cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in ; Harry , Ron , and Hermione , however , were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid . 
Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts , though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts ; finally , only one skrewt was left . 
" Jus ' try an slip the rope ' round his sting , so he won hurt any o ' the others ! " " Yeah , we wouldn't want that ! " Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid's cabin , still holding the skrewt off with their sparks . 
" Well , well , well . . . 
this does look like fun . " Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid's garden fence , looking in at the mayhem . 
She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today , and her crocodile - skin handbag was over her arm . 
Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it ; a blast of fire shot out of its end , withering the pumpkin plants nearby . 
" Who ' re you ? " Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt's sting and tightened it . 
" Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter , " Rita replied , beaming at him . 
Rita acted as though she hadn't heard what Hagrid had said . 
" What are these fascinating creatures called ? " she asked , beaming still more widely . 
" I ' ve never heard of them before ... where do they come from ? " 
Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid's wild black beard , and his heart sank . 
Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from ? 
Harry ? " " What ? 
Oh yeah . . . 
interesting , " said Harry as she stepped on his foot . 
" Ah , you ' re here . 
Harry ! " said Rita Skeeter as she looked around . 
" So you like Care of Magical Creatures , do you ? 
One of your favorite lessons ? " " Yes , " said Harry stoutly . 
Hagrid beamed at him . 
" Lovely , " said Rita . " Really lovely . 
Lavender ( whose robes were badly singed ) , Seamus ( who was nursing several burnt fingers ) , and then to the cabin windows , where most of the class stood , their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear . 
" This is o ' ny me second year , " said Hagrid . 
I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview , would you ? 
Share some of your experience of magical creatures ? 
The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday , as I'm sure you know . 
" Blast - Ended Skrewts , " Hagrid said eagerly . 
" Er - yeah , why not ? " 
Harry had a very bad feeling about this , but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing , so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week . 
Then the bell rang up at the castle , signaling the end of the lesson . 
" Well , good - bye , Harry ! " Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione . 
" Worst that can happen is Hagrid ' ll have to get rid of the skrewts . 
Sorry . . . 
did I say worst ? 
Harry and Hermione laughed , and , feeling slightly more cheerful , went off to lunch . 
Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon ; they were still doing star charts and predictions , but now that he and Ron were friends once more , the whole thing seemed very funny again . 
As I sat here , absorbed in my needlework , the urge to consult the orb overpowered me . 
I arose , I settled myself before it , and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . 
Ron muttered under his breath . 
Harry fought hard to keep his face straight . 
Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths , looking horrified . 
ever lower over the castle . . . 
She stared pointedly at Harry , who yawned very widely and obviously . 
" It'd be a bit more impressive if she hadn't done it about eighty times before , " Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney's room . 
" But if I'd dropped dead every time she's told me I'm going to , I'd be a medical miracle . " 
" You'd be a sort of extra - concentrated ghost , " said Ron , chortling , as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction , his wide eyes staring sinisterly . 
" At least we didn't get homework . 
But Hermione wasn't at dinner , nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward . 
The only person in there was Viktor Krum . 
Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while , watching Krum , debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph - but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books , debating exactly the same thing , and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea . 
" Wonder where she's got to ? " Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower . 
But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione's arrival . 
" Harry , you ' ve got to come - you ' ve got to come , the most amazing thing's happened - please - " She seized Harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor . 
" What's the matter ? " 
Harry said . 
" I ' ll show you when we get there - oh come on , quick - " Harry looked around at Ron ; he looked back at Harry , intrigued . 
" Okay , " Harry said , starting off back down the corridor with Hermione , Ron hurrying to keep up . 
" Don't apologize for bothering me ! 
Ron shouted over his shoulder . 
" Hermione , where are we going ? " 
Harry asked , after she had led them down through six floors , and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall . 
" You ' ll see , you ' ll see in a minute ! " said Hermione excitedly . 
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry's names . 
Harry had never been through here before . 
He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps , but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape's dungeon , they found themselves in a broad stone corridor , brightly lit with torches , and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food . 
" Oh hang on . . 
. " said Harry slowly , halfway down the corridor . 
" Wait a minute , Hermione . . . 
. " " What ? " 
She turned around to look at him , anticipation all over her face . 
" I know what this is about , " said Harry . 
He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione . 
It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl . 
" Hermione ! " said Ron , cottoning on . 
I'm not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work , I'm not doing it - " " I'm not asking you to ! " Hermione said impatiently . 
" I came down here just now , to talk to them all , and I found - oh come on , Harry , I want to show you ! " 
She seized his arm again , pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl , stretched out her forefinger , and tickled the huge green pear . 
It began to squirm , chuckling , and suddenly turned into a large green door handle . 
Hermione seized it , pulled the door open , and pushed Harry hard in the back , forcing him inside . 
He had one brief glimpse of an enormous , high - ceilinged room , large as the Great Hall above it , with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls , and a great brick fireplace at the other end , when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room , squealing , " Harry Potter , sir ! 
Harry Potter ! " Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff , hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break . 
" D - Dobby ? " 
Harry gasped . 
" Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter , sir , and Harry Potter has come to see him , sir ! " Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces , beaming up at Harry , his enormous , green , tennis - ball - shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness . 
He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him ; the pencil - shaped nose , the batlike ears , the long fingers and feet - all except the clothes , which were very different . 
When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys , he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase . 
Now , however , he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen ; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup . 
He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat , on which he had pinned a number of bright badges ; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest , a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts , and odd socks . 
One of these , Harry saw , was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr . Malfoy into giving Dobby , thereby setting Dobby free . 
The other was covered in pink and orange stripes . 
" Dobby , what ' re you doing here ? " 
Harry said in amazement . 
" Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts , sir ! " Dobby squealed excitedly . 
" Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs , sir ! " Winky ? " said Harry . 
" She's here too ? " " Yes , sir , yes ! " said Dobby , and he seized Harry's hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there . 
Each of these tables , Harry noticed as he passed them , was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above , in the Great Hall . 
At the moment , they were clear of food , dinner having finished , but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above . 
At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen , beaming , bowing , and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them . 
They were all wearing the same uniform : a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest , and tied , as Winky's had been , like a toga . 
Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed . 
" Winky , sir ! " he said . 
Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire . 
Unlike Dobby , she had obviously not foraged for clothes . 
She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat , which had holes in it for her large ears . 
However , while every one of Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand - new , Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all . 
There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt . 
" Hello , Winky , " said Harry . 
Winky's lip quivered . 
Then she burst into tears , which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front , just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup . 
" Oh dear , " said Hermione . 
She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen . 
" Winky , don't cry , please don't ... " But Winky cried harder than ever . 
Dobby , on the other hand , beamed up at Harry . 
" Er - yeah , okay , " said Harry . 
Instantly , about six house - elves came trotting up behind him , bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot , cups for Harry , Ron , and Hermione , a milk jug , and a large plate of biscuits . 
" Good service ! " Ron said , in an impressed voice . 
" How long have you been here , Dobby ? " 
Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea . 
" Only a week . 
Harry Potter , sir ! " said Dobby happily . 
" Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir . 
" Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years , sir , trying to find work ! " 
Dobby squeaked . 
" But Dobby hasn't found work , sir , because Dobby wants paying now ! " 
The house - elves all around the kitchen , who had been listening and watching with interest , all looked away at these words , as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing . 
' That's not the point of a houseelf , ' they says , and they slammed the door in Dobby's face ! 
Dobby likes work , but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid . 
Harry Potter .... Dobby likes being free ! " 
Winky , however , remained where she was , though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying . 
" And then , Harry Potter , Dobby goes to visit Winky , and finds out Winky has been freed too , sir ! " said Dobby delightedly . 
Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her , but nothing she said made the slightest difference . 
" And then Dobby had the idea . 
Harry Potter , sir ! ' Why doesn't Dobby and Winky find work together ? ' 
Dobby says . 
So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir , and Professor Dumbledore took us on ! " 
Dobby beamed very brightly , and happy tears welled in his eyes again . 
" And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby , sir , if Dobby wants paying ! 
And so Dobby is a free elf , sir , and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month ! " " That's not very much ! " Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor , over Winky's continued screaming and fist - beating . 
" Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week , and weekends off , " said Dobby , suddenly giving a little shiver , as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening , " but Dobby beat him down , miss . . . . 
" And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you , Winky ? " Hermione asked kindly . 
If she had thought this would cheer up Winky , she was wildly mistaken . 
Winky did stop crying , but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes , her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious . 
" Winky is a disgraced elf , but Winky is not yet getting paid ! " she squeaked . 
" Winky is not sunk so low as that ! 
Winky is properly ashamed of being freed ! " " Ashamed ? " said Hermione blankly . 
" But - Winky , come on ! 
It's Mr . Crouch who should be ashamed , not you ! 
You is not insulting Mr . Crouch ! 
Mr . Crouch is a good wizard , miss ! 
Mr . Crouch is right to sack bad Winky ! " " Winky is having trouble adjusting , Harry Potter , " squeaked Dobby confidentially . 
" Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr . Crouch anymore ; she is allowed to speak her mind now , but she won't do it . " 
Harry asked . 
" Oh no , sir , no , " said Dobby , looking suddenly serious . 
We upholds the family's honor , and we never speaks ill of them - though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this . 
Professor Dumbledore said we is free to to - " Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer . 
Harry bent forward . 
Dobby whispered , " He said we is free to call him a - a barmy old codger if we likes , sir ! " Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle . 
" But Dobby is not wanting to , Harry Potter , " he said , talking normally again , and shaking his head so that his ears flapped . 
" Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much , sir , and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him . " 
" But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now ? " 
Harry asked him , grinning . 
A slightly fearful look came into Dobby's immense eyes . 
" Dobby - Dobby could , " he said doubtfully . 
He squared his small shoulders . 
Dobby stood for a moment , quivering all over , horror - struck by his own daring then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard , squealing , " Bad Dobby ! 
Bad Dobby ! " 
Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table . 
" Thank you . 
Harry Potter , thank you , " said Dobby breathlessly , rubbing his head . 
" You just need a bit of practice , " Harry said . 
" Practice ! " 
" My poor Mr . Crouch , what is he doing without Winky ? 
He is needing me , he is needing my help ! 
I is looking after the Crouches all my life , and my mother is doing it before me , and my grandmother is doing it before her ... oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed ? 
Oh the shame , the shame ! " 
She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled . 
" Winky , " said Hermione firmly , " I'm quite sure Mr . Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you . 
" You is seeing him here at Hogwarts ? " " Yes , " said Hermione , " he and Mr . Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament . " 
" Mr . 
Bagman comes too ? " squeaked Winky , and to Harry's great surprise ( and Ron's and Hermione's too , by the looks on their faces ) , she looked angry again . 
" Mr . 
Bagman is a bad wizard ! 
A very bad wizard ! 
My master isn't liking him , oh no , not at all ! " " Bagman - bad ? " said Harry . 
But Winky is not saying .. . 
Winky - Winky keeps her master's secrets . 
They left her to her crying and finished their tea , while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages . 
" Dobby is going to buy a sweater next , Harry Potter ! " he said happily , pointing at his bare chest , " Tell you what , Dobby , " said Ron , who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf , " I ' ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas , I always get one from her . 
You don't mind maroon , do you ? " 
Dobby was delighted . 
" We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you , " Ron told him , " but it ' ll go well with your tea cozy . " 
As they prepared to take their leave , many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them , offering snacks to take back upstairs . 
Hermione refused , with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying , but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies . 
" Thanks a lot ! " Harry said to the elves , who had all clustered around the door to say good night . 
" See you , Dobby ! " " Harry Potter . . . 
can Dobby come and see you sometimes , sir ? " Dobby asked tentatively . 
" ' Course you can , " said Harry , and Dobby beamed . 
" You know what ? " said Ron , once he , Hermione , and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again . 
" I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves , you know , " said Hermione , leading the way back up the marble staircase . 
" Dobby coming to work here , I mean . 
" Oh she ' ll cheer up , " said Hermione , though she sounded a bit doubtful . 
" Once the shock's worn off , and she's got used to Hogwarts , she ' ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man . " " She seems to love him , " said Ron thickly ( he had just started on a cream cake ) . 
" Percy wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy . " 
Potter ! Weasley ! 
Professor McGonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday , and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up . 
It was the end of the lesson ; they had finished their work ; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall's desk ( Neville's still had feathers ) ; they had copied down their homework from the blackboard ( " Describe , with examples , the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross - Species Switches " } . 
The bell was due to ring at any moment , and Harry and Ron , who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's fake wands at the back of the class , looked up , Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry , a rubber haddock . 
" Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age , " said Professor McGonagall , with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - Ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before - " I have something to say to you all . 
" The Yule Ball is approaching - a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests . 
Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs , her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle . 
They both looked around at Harry , Professor McGonagall ignored them , which Harry thought was distinctly unfair , as she had just told off him and Ron . 
" Dress robes will be worn , " Professor McGonagall continued , " and the ball will start at eight o ' clock on Christmas Day , finishing at midnight in the Great Hall . 
Now then - " Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class . 
Harry could see what was funny this time : Professor McGonagall , with her hair in a tight bun , looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense . 
" But that does NOT mean , " Professor McGonagall went on , " that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students . 
The bell rang , and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders . 
Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock , Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher's desk . 
Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone , and then said , " Potter , the champions and their partners - " " What partners ? " said Harry . 
" Your dance partners . " 
Harry's insides seemed to curl up and shrivel . 
He felt himself going red . 
" I don't dance , " he said quickly . 
" Oh yes , you do , " said Professor McGonagall irritably . 
" That's what I'm telling you . 
Traditionally , the champions and their partners open the ball . " 
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails , accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon's work parties . 
" I'm not dancing , " he said . 
" It is traditional , " said Professor McGonagall firmly . 
" You are a Hogwarts champion , and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school . 
So make sure you get yourself a partner , Potter . " 
A week ago . 
Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail . 
But now that he had done the latter , and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball , he thought he'd rather have another round with the dragon . 
Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas ; he always did , of course , because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive , but he had always been very much in the minority before now . 
This year , however , everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying , and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball - or at least all the girls were , and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold ; he had never quite noticed that before . 
Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors , girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them , girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night ... . 
Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them , sniggering and staring at Harry . 
Ron suggested . 
" Got any idea who you ' re going to try ? " Harry didn't answer . 
Cho was a year older than he was ; she was very pretty ; she was a very good Quidditch player , and she was also very popular . 
Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry's head . 
" Listen , you ' re not going to have any trouble . 
You ' re a champion . 
You ' ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail . 
I bet they ' ll be queuing up to go with you . " 
In tribute to their recently repaired friendship , Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum . 
Moreover , to Harry's amazement , he turned out to be quite right . 
A curly - haired third - year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day . 
Harry was so taken aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter . 
The girl walked off looking rather hurt , and Harry had to endure Dean's , Seamus's , and Ron's taunts about her all through History of Magic . 
The following day , two more girls asked him , a second year and ( to his horror ) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused . 
" She was a foot taller than me , " said Harry , still unnerved . 
" They only like him because he's famous ! " 
Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn't been a school champion . 
Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him . 
On the whole . 
Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him , life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task . 
He wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore , which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric - he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone , in gratitude for Harry's tipoff about the dragons . 
Draco Malfoy , of course , was still quoting Rita Skeeter's article to him at every possible opportunity , but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it and just to heighten Harry's feeling of well - being , no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet . 
" She didn'seem very int ' rested in magical creatures , ter tell yeh the truth , " Hagrid said , when Harry , Ron , and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term . 
To their very great relief , Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now , and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today , sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts . 
" She jus ' wanted me ter talk about you , Harry , " Hagrid continued in a low voice . 
" Well , I told her we'd been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys . 
Yeh'd think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible , Harry . " 
" ' Course she did , " said Harry , throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more . 
" She can't keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am , it ' ll get boring . " 
" You were supposed to say Harry's a mad delinquent ! " " But he's not ! " said Hagrid , looking genuinely shocked . 
" She should ' ve interviewed Snape , " said Harry grimly . 
' Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school . . . 
. ' " " Said that , did he ? " said Hagrid , while Ron and Hermione laughed . 
Harry , bu ' yeh ' re all righ ' really , aren ' you ? " " Cheers , Hagrid , " said Harry , grinning . 
The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed . 
Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn't know , never having had access to a wizard's wireless , but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN ( Wizarding Wireless Network ) that they were a very famous musical group . 
Some of the teachers , like little Professor Flitwick , gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere ; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday , and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament . 
Other teachers were not so generous . 
It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percys cauldron - bottom report . 
Staring nastily around at them all , he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term . 
" Evil , he is , " Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room . 
" Springing a test on us on the last day . 
Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying . " 
you ' re not exactly straining yourself , though , are you ? " said Hermione , looking at him over the top of her Potions notes . 
Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack - a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards , because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second . 
" It's Christmas , Hermione , " said Harry lazily ; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire . 
Hermione looked severely over at him too . 
" I'd have thought you'd be doing something constructive , Harry , even if you don't want to learn your antidotes ! " 
" Like what ? " 
Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser . 
" That egg ! " Hermione hissed . 
" Come on , Hermione , I ' ve got till February the twenty - fourth , " Harry said . 
He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn't opened it since the celebration party after the first task . 
There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant , after all . 
" But it might take weeks to work it out ! " said Hermione . 
" You ' re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don't ! " " Leave him alone , Hermione , he's earned a bit of a break , " said Ron , and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up , singeing his eyebrows . 
It was Fred and George . 
They sat down at the table with Harry , Ron , and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done . 
" Ron , can we borrow Pigwidgeon ? " George asked . 
" No , he's off delivering a letter , " said Ron . " Why ? " " Because George wants to invite him to the ball , " said Fred sarcastically . 
" Who d ' you two keep writing to , eh ? " said Ron . " Nose out , Ron , or I ' ll burn that for you too , " said Fred , waving his wand threateningly . 
" So . . . 
you lot got dates for the ball yet ? " " Nope , " said Ron . " Well , you'd better hurry up , mate , or all the good ones will be gone , " said Fred . " Who ' re you going with , then ? " said Ron . " Angelina , " said Fred promptly , without a trace of embarrassment . 
" What ? " said Ron , taken aback . 
" You ' ve already asked her ? " " Good point , " said Fred . 
He turned his head and called across the common room , " Oi ! Angelina ! " 
" What ? " she called back . 
" Want to come to the ball with me ? " Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look . 
" All right , then , " she said , and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face . 
" There you go , " said Fred to Harry and Ron , " piece of cake . " 
They left . 
Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry . 
He's right . 
Hermione let out a sputter of indignation . 
" I'd rather go alone than with - with Eloise Midgen , say . " " Her acne's loads better lately - and she's really nice ! " " Her nose is off - center , " said Ron . " Oh I see , " Hermione said , bristling . 
" So basically , you ' re going to take the bestlooking girl who ' ll have you , even if she's completely horrible ? " 
The Hogwarts staff , demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas . 
When the decorations went up . 
Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school . 
Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase ; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real , hooting , golden owls , and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them . 
Several times , Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor , where he had taken to hiding , filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention , all of which were very rude . 
And still . 
Harry hadn't asked Cho to the ball . 
He and Ron were getting very nervous now , though as Harry pointed out , Ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner ; Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions . 
" I suppose there's always Moaning Myrtle , " he said gloomily , referring to the ghost who haunted the girls ' toilets on the second floor . 
" When we get back to the common room tonight , we ' ll both have partners agreed ? " " Er . . . 
okay , " said Harry . 
But every time he glimpsed Cho that day - during break , and then lunchtime , and once on the way to History of Magic - she was surrounded by friends . 
Didn't she ever go anywhere alone ? 
But no - she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls . 
He found it hard to concentrate on Snape's Potions test , and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient - a bezoar - meaning that he received bottom marks . 
He didn't care , though ; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do . 
When the bell rang , he grabbed his bag , and hurried to the dungeon door . 
" I ' ll meet you at dinner , " he said to Ron and Hermione , and he dashed off upstairs . 
He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her , and ( rather sooner than he had expected ) he found her , emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson . 
Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs . 
" Er , " he said . 
But he had to . 
Cho stood there looking puzzled , watching him . 
" Sorry ? " said Cho . " D ' you - d ' you want to go to the ball with me ? " said Harry . 
Why did he have to go red now ? 
" Oh Harry , I'm really sorry , " and she truly looked it . 
" I ' ve already said I ' ll go with someone else . " " Oh , " said Harry . 
" Oh okay , " he said , " no problem . " 
" I'm really sorry , " she said again . 
" That's okay , " said Harry . 
They stood there looking at each other , and then Cho said , " Well - " " Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Well , ' bye , " said Cho , still very red . 
She walked away . 
Harry called after her , before he could stop himself . 
" Who ' re you going with ? " " Oh - Cedric , " she said . 
" Oh right , " said Harry . 
It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence . 
Completely forgetting about dinner , he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower , Cho's voice echoing in his ears with every step he took . 
He had been starting to quite like Cedric - prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch , and was handsome , and popular , and nearly everyone's favorite champion . 
" Fairy lights , " he said dully to the Fat Lady - the password had been changed the previous day . 
Entering the common room , Harry looked around , and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen - faced in a distant corner . 
Ginny was sitting with him , talking to him in what seemed to be a low , soothing voice . 
" What's up , Ron ? " said Harry , joining them . 
Ron looked up at Harry , a sort of blind horror in his face . 
" Why did I do it ? " 
he said wildly . 
" I don't know what made me do it ! 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" He - er - just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him , " said Ginny . 
" You what ?'said Harry . 
" I don't know what made me do it ! " 
Ron gasped again . 
" What was I playing at ? 
I was just walking past her in the entrance hall - she was standing there talking to Diggory and it sort of came over me - and I asked her ! " Ron moaned and put his face in his hands . 
He kept talking , though the words were barely distinguishable . 
" She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something . 
And then - I dunno - I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it . " 
" She's part veela , " said Harry . 
It wasn't your fault , I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it - but she was wasting her time . 
He's going with Cho Chang . " 
Ron looked up . 
" I asked her to go with me just now , " Harry said dully , " and she told me . " 
Hey - guess who he asked ? 
" He told me after Potions ! 
As if ! 
She just didn't want to go with Neville ... I mean , who would ? " " Don't ! " said Ginny , annoyed . 
" Don't laugh - " Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole . 
That shut Harry and Ron up . 
" Thanks a bunch , Ginny , " said Ron sourly . 
" Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now , is she ? 
Well , I'm sure you ' ll find someone somewhere who ' ll have you . " 
But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light . 
" Hermione , Neville's right - you are a girl . . . 
. " " Oh well spotted , " she said acidly . 
" Well - you can come with one of us ! " " No , I can't , " snapped Hermione . 
. " " I can't come with you , " said Hermione , now blushing , " because I'm already going with someone . " 
" No , you ' re not ! " said Ron . " You just said that to get rid of Neville ! " " Oh did I ? " said Hermione , and her eyes flashed dangerously . 
" Just because it's taken you three years to notice , Ron , doesn't mean no one else has spotted I'm a girl ! " Ron stared at her . 
Then he grinned again . 
" Okay , okay , we know you ' re a girl , " he said . 
" That do ? 
Will you come now ? " " I ' ve already told you ! " Hermione said very angrily . 
" I'm going with someone else ! " 
" She's lying , " said Ron flatly , watching her go . 
" She's not , " said Ginny quietly . 
" Who is it then ? " said Ron sharply . 
" I'm not telling you , it's her business , " said Ginny . 
Ginny , you can go with Harry , and I ' ll just - " " I can't , " said Ginny , and she went scarlet too . 
" I'm going with - with Neville . 
well . . . 
I'm not going to be able to go otherwise , I'm not in fourth year . " 
She looked extremely miserable . 
" I think I ' ll go and have dinner , " she said , and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole , her head bowed . 
Ron goggled at Harry . 
But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole . 
" Wait here , " he said to Ron , and he stood up , walked straight up to Parvati , and said , " Parvati ? 
Will you go to the ball with me ? " Parvati went into a fit of giggles . 
Harry waited for them to subside , his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes . 
" Thanks , " said Harry , in relief . 
" Lavender - will you go with Ron ? " " She's going with Seamus , " said Parvati , and the pair of them giggled harder than ever . 
Harry sighed . 
" Can't you think of anyone who'd go with Ron ? " he said , lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn't hear . 
" What about Hermione Granger ? " said Parvati . 
" Ooooh - who ? " she said keenly . 
Harry shrugged . 
" No idea , " he said . 
" So what about Ron ? " " Well . . 
. " said Parvati slowly , " I suppose my sister might . . . 
Padma , you know ... in Ravenclaw . 
I ' ll ask her if you like . " 
" Yeah , that would be great , " said Harry . 
" Let me know , will you ? " 
And he went back over to Ron , feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth , and hoping very much that Padma Patil's nose was dead center . 
Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays . 
Harry was in no mood to work when term ended , and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else . 
Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term - time ; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too , as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual . 
Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams , and for the first couple of days of the holidays , people kept bursting into feather all over the place . 
Before long , however , all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution , in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center , and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something else . 
Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future . 
The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large , chilly , frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid's cabin , while the Durmstrang ship's portholes were glazed with ice , the rigging white with frost . 
The house - elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich , warming stews and savory puddings , and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about . 
" It is too ' eavy , all zis ' Ogwarts food , " they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening ( Ron skulking behind Harry , keen not to be spotted by Fleur ) . 
" I will not fit into my dress robes ! " " Oooh there's a tragedy , " Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall . 
" She really thinks a lot of herself , that one , doesn't she ? " " Hermione - who are you going to the ball with ? " said Ron . 
However , Hermione merely frowned and said , " I'm not telling you , you ' ll just make fun of me . " " You ' re joking , Weasley ! " said Malfoy , behind them . 
" You ' re not telling me someone's asked that to the ball ? 
" Twitchy little ferret , aren't you , Malfoy ? " said Hermione scathingly , and she , Harry , and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily . 
" Hermione , " said Ron , looking sideways at her , suddenly frowning , " your teeth ... " " What about them ? " she said . 
I ' ve just noticed . . . 
They're all ... straight and - and normal - sized . " 
Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously , and Harry noticed it too : It was a very different smile from the one he remembered . 
" Well . . . 
when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk , she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were , " she said . 
" And I just . . . 
let her carry on a bit . " 
She smiled even more widely . 
I ' ve been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages , but they wanted me to carry on with my braces . 
People passing him were pointing and laughing , and a group of third - year girls paused and said , " Oh look at the weeny owl ! Isn't he cute ? " 
Stupid little feathery git ! " Ron hissed , hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon . 
" You bring letters to the addressee ! 
You don't hang around showing off ! " Pigwidgeon hooted happily , his head protruding over Ron's fist . 
The third - year girls all looked very shocked . 
Harry pocketed it , and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it . 
Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to . 
Ron , Harry , and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow , and Harry read out : Dear Harry , 
Congratulations on getting past the Horntail . 
Harry . 
Keep in touch , I still want to hear about anything unusual . 
Sirius " He sounds exactly like Moody , " said Harry quietly , tucking the letter away again inside his robes . 
You really ought to have a look at that egg , you know , and start working out what it means . . . 
. " " Hermione , he's got ages ! " snapped Ron . 
" Want a game of chess , Harry ? " " Yeah , okay , " said Harry . 
Then , spotting the look on Hermione's face , he said , " Come on , how ' m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on ? 
I won't even be able to hear the egg over this lot . " 
Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day . 
Wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness , he opened his eyes , and saw something with very large , round , green eyes staring back at him in the darkness , so close they were almost nose to nose . 
" Dobby ! " 
Harry yelled , scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed . 
" Don't do that ! " 
" Dobby is sorry , sir ! " squeaked Dobby anxiously , jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth . 
" Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter ' Merry Christmas ' and bring him a present , Sir ! 
.. " Harry pulled back the curtains around his four - poster , took his glasses from his bedside table , and put them on . 
His yell had awoken Ron , Seamus , Dean , and Neville . 
" Someone attacking you , Harry ? " Seamus asked sleepily . 
" No , it's just Dobby , " Harry muttered . 
" Go back to sleep . " 
presents ! " said Seamus , spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed . 
Ron , Dean , and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present - opening too . 
Harry turned back to Dobby , who was now standing nervously next to Harrys bed , still looking worried that he had upset Harry . 
There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy . 
" Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present ? " he squeaked tentatively . 
" ' Course you can , " said Harry . 
I ' ve got something for you too . " 
The reason they were extra - knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now . 
He pulled out the Sneako - scope and handed the socks to Dobby , saying , " Sorry , I forgot to wrap them ... " But Dobby was utterly delighted . 
" I has seven now , sir . . . . 
But sir ... " he said , his eyes widening , having pulled both socks up to their highest extent , so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts , " they has made a mistake in the shop , Harry Potter , they is giving you two the same ! " " Ah , no , Harry , how come you didn't spot that ? " said Ron , grinning over from his own bed , which was now strewn with wrapping paper . 
" Tell you what , Dobby here you go - take these two , and you can mix them up properly . 
He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped , and the handknitted sweater Mrs . Weasley had sent , Dobby looked quite overwhelmed . 
" Sir is very kind ! " he squeaked , his eyes brimming with tears again , bowing deeply to Ron . " Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard , for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend , but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit , as noble , as selfless - " " They're only socks , " said Ron , who had gone slightly pink around the ears , though he looked rather pleased all the same . 
" Wow , Harry - " He had just opened Harry's present , a Chudley Cannon hat . 
He jammed it onto his head , where it clashed horribly with his hair . 
Dobby now handed Harry a small package , which turned out to be - socks . 
" Dobby is making them himself , sir ! " the elf said happily . 
" He is buying the wool out of his wages , sir ! " 
" They're . . . 
they ' re really . . . 
" Dobby must go now , sir , we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens ! " said Dobby , and he hurried out of the dormitory , waving good - bye to Ron and the others as he passed . 
Harry's other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby's odd socks - with the obvious exception of the Dursleys ' , which consisted of a single tissue , an alltime low - Harry supposed they too were remember ing the Ton - Tongue Toffee . 
Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland ; Ron , a bulging bag of Dungbombs ; Sirius , a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot ; and Hagrid , a vast box of sweets including all Harrys favorites : Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans , Chocolate Frogs , Drooble's Best Blowing Gum , and Fizzing Whizbees . 
There was also , of course , Mrs . Weasley's usual package , including a new sweater ( green , with a picture of a dragon on it - Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail ) , and a large quantity of homemade mince pies . 
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room , and they went down to breakfast together . 
They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower , where everyone was enjoying their presents , then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch , which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings , and large piles of Cribbage's Wizarding Crackers . 
They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon ; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle . 
Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys'snowball fight rather than join in , and at five o ' clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball . 
" What , you need three hours ? " said Ron , looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball , thrown by George , hit him hard on the side of the head . 
" Who ' re you going with ? " he yelled after Hermione , but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle . 
There was no Christmas tea today , as the ball included a feast , so at seven o ' clock , when it had become hard to aim properly , the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room . 
The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs , both of them extremely tipsy , empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture . 
" Lairy fights , that's the one ! " she giggled when they gave the password , and she swung forward to let them inside . 
Harry , Ron , Seamus , Dean , and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory , all of them looking very self - conscious , but none as much as Ron , who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face . 
There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else . 
In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly , he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs . 
" I still can't work out how you two got the best - looking girls in the year , " muttered Dean . 
The common room looked strange , full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black . 
Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs . 
She looked very pretty indeed , in robes of shocking pink , with her long dark plait braided with gold , and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists . 
Harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling . 
" You - er - look nice , " he said awkwardly . 
" Thanks , " she said . 
" Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall , " she added to Ron . " Right , " said Ron , looking around . 
" Where's Hermione ? " 
Parvati shrugged . 
" Shall we go down then , Harry ? " " Okay , " said Harry , wishing he could just stay in the common room . 
Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole . 
The entrance hall was packed with students too , all milling around waiting for eight o ' clock , when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open . 
Parvati found her sister , Padma , and led her over to Harry and Ron . 
" Hi , " said Padma , who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise . 
" Hi , " said Ron , not looking at her , but staring around at the crowd . 
" Oh no ... " He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry , because Fleur Delacour was passing , looking stunning in robes of silver - gray satin , and accompanied by the 
When they had disappeared , Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd . 
" Where is Hermione ? " he said again . 
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room . 
Malfoy was in front ; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar , which in Harry's opinion made him look like a vicar . 
Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy's arm . 
Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green ; they resembled moss - colored boulders , and neither of them , Harry was pleased to see , had managed to find a partner . 
The oak front doors opened , and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff . 
Krum was at the front of the party , accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn't know . 
Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights - meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there , and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer . 
Then Professor McGonagall's voice called , " Champions over here , please ! " 
Parvati readjusted her bangles , beaming ; she and Harry said , " See you in a minute " to Ron and Padma and walked forward , the chattering crowd parting to let them through . 
Professor McGonagall , who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat , told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside ; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down . 
Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors ; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her . 
Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too ; he looked away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them . 
It was Hermione . 
But she didn't look like Hermione at all . 
She had done something with her hair ; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny , and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head . 
She was wearing robes made of a floaty , periwinkle - blue material , and she was holding herself differently , somehow - or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back . 
She was also smiling - rather nervously , it was true - but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever ; Harry couldn't understand how he hadn't spotted it before . 
" Hi , Harry ! " she said . 
" Hi , Parvati ! " Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief . 
She wasn't the only one either ; when the doors to the Great Hall opened , Krum's fan club from the library stalked past , throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing . 
Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy , and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her . Ron , however , walked right past Hermione without looking at her . 
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall , Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her . 
They did so , and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall , where the judges were sitting . 
The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost , with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling . 
Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself ; she was beaming around at everybody , steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces . 
He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table . 
Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes . 
Padma was looking sulky . 
Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table , but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron's as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer . 
Ludo Bagman , tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars , was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students ; and Madame Maxime , who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk , was applauding them politely . 
But Mr . Crouch , Harry suddenly realized , was not there . 
The fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley . 
When the champions and their partners reached the table , Percy drew out the empty chair beside him , staring pointedly at Harry . 
Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy , who was wearing brand - new , navy - blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined . 
" I'm now Mr . Crouch's personal assistant , and I'm here representing him . " 
" Why didn't he come ? " 
Harry asked . 
" I'm afraid to say Mr . Crouch isn't well , not well at all . 
Hasn't been right since the World Cup . 
He's not as young as he was - though still quite brilliant , of course , the mind remains as great as it ever was . 
But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry , and then , Mr . Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house - elf of his , Blinky , or whatever she was called . 
And then we had the tournament to arrange , and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with - that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around - no , poor man , he's having a well earned , quiet Christmas . 
I'm just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place . " 
Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr . Crouch had stopped calling Percy " Weatherby " yet , but resisted the temptation . 
There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates , but small menus were lying in front of each of them . 
Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around there were no waiters . 
Dumbledore , however , looked carefully down at his own menu , then said very clearly to his plate , " Pork chops ! " 
Getting the idea , the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too . 
Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining - surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house - elves ? 
She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating . 
It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak before , but he was certainly talking now , and very enthusiastically at that . 
" Veil , ve have a castle also , not as big as this , nor as comfortable , I am thinking , " he was telling Hermione . 
" Ve have just four floors , and the fires are lit only for magical purposes . 
" Well , Dumbledore , " said Karkaroff , displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent , " we are all protective of our private domains , are we not ? 
Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us ? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school's secrets , and right to protect them ? " " Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts'secrets , Igor , " said Dumbledore amicably . 
" Only this morning , for instance , I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before , containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots . 
When I went back to investigate more closely , I discovered that the room had vanished . 
But I must keep an eye out for it . 
Or it may only appear at the quarter moon - or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder . " 
Harry snorted into his plate of goulash . 
Percy frowned , but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink . 
Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies . 
" Zis is nothing , " she said dismissively , looking around at the sparkling walls of the Great Hall . 
Zey do not melt , of course . . . 
And ze food is seemply superb . 
Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face , and he kept missing his mouth with his fork . 
Harry had the impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying . 
" Absolutely right , " he said quickly , slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur . 
" Like that . 
Yeah . " 
Harry looked around the Hall . 
Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables ; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table . 
Harry saw him give a small wave , and looking around , saw Madame Maxime return it , her opals glittering in the candlelight . 
Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly ; he kept calling her " Hermy - own . " 
" Her - my - oh - nee , " she said slowly and clearly . 
" Herm - own - ninny . " 
" Close enough , " she said , catching Harry's eye and grinning . 
When all the food had been consumed , Dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same . 
Then , with a wave of his wand , all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear , and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall . 
A set of drums , several guitars , a lute , a cello , and some bagpipes were set upon it . 
They picked up their instruments , and Harry , who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming , suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out , and that the other champions and their partners were standing up . 
" Come on ! " 
Parvati hissed . 
" We're supposed to dance ! " 
The Weird Sisters struck up a slow , mournful tune ; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor , carefully avoiding catching anyone's eye ( he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering ) , and next moment , Parvati had seized his hands , placed one around her waist , and was holding the other tightly in hers . 
It wasn't as bad as it could have been . 
He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people , and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor , so that the champions were no longer the center of attention . 
Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby - he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet - and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime . 
Potter , " Moody growled as he passed , his magical eye staring through Harry's robes . 
" He is so creepy ! " 
Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away . 
" I don't think that eye should be allowed . " 
Harry heard the final , quavering note from the bagpipe with relief . 
The Weird Sisters stopped playing , applause filled the hall once more , and Harry let go of Parvati at once . 
Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song , which was much faster . 
" No , I don't like it , " Harry lied , and he led her away from the dance floor , past Fred and Angelina , who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury , and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting . 
" How's it going ? " 
Harry asked Ron , sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer . 
Ron didn't answer . 
He was glaring at Hermione and Krum , who were dancing nearby . 
Parvati sat down on Harry's other side , crossed her arms and legs too , and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from 
Beauxbatons . 
" You don't mind , do you , Harry ? " Parvati said . 
" What ? " said Harry , who was now watching Cho and Cedric . 
" Oh never mind , " snapped Parvati , and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons . 
When the song ended , she did not return . 
Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati's empty chair . 
She was a bit pink in the face from dancing . 
" Hi , " said Harry . 
Ron didn't say anything . 
Ron gave her a withering look . 
" Viktor ? " he said . 
Hermione looked at him in surprise . 
" What's up with you ? " she said . 
" If you don't know , " said Ron scathingly , " I'm not going to tell you . " 
Hermione stared at him , then at Harry , who shrugged . 
" Ron , what - ? " " He's from Durmstrang ! " spat Ron . 
" He's competing against Harry ! 
Against Hogwarts ! 
You - you ' re - " Ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe Hermione's crime , " fraternizing with the enemy , that's what you ' re doing ! " Hermione's mouth fell open . 
" The enemy ! 
Honestly - who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive ? 
Who was the one who wanted his autograph ? 
Ron chose to ignore this . 
" I s ' pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library ? " " Yes , he did , " said Hermione , the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly . 
" So what ? " " What happened - trying to get him to join spew , were you ? " " No , I wasn't ! 
If you really want to know , he - he said he'd been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me , but he hadn't been able to pluck up the courage ! " Hermione said this very quickly , and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as Parvati's robes . 
" Yeah , well - that's his story , " said Ron nastily . 
" And what's that supposed to mean ? " " Obvious , isn't it ? 
He's Karkaroff's student , isn't he ? 
He's just trying to get closer to Harry - get inside information on him - or get near enough to jinx him - " Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her . 
When she spoke , her voice quivered . 
" Then he's hoping you ' ll help him find out what his egg means ! 
How could you say something like that - I want Harry to win the tournament . 
" No it isn't ! " 
shouted Ron . 
" It's about winning ! " 
" Ron , " said Harry quietly , " I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum - " But Ron ignored Harry too . " Why don't you go and find Vicky , he ' ll be wondering where you are , " said Ron . " Don't call him Vicky ! " Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor , disappearing into the crowd . 
Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face . 
" Are you going to ask me to dance at all ? " Padma asked him . 
" No , " said Ron , still glaring after Hermione . 
" Fine , " snapped Padma , and she got up and went to join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy , who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that 
Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm . 
" Vare is Herm - own - ninny ? " said a voice . 
" No idea , " said Ron mulishly , looking up at him . 
" Lost her , have you ? " 
" Veil , if you see her , tell her I haff drinks , " he said , and he slouched off . 
" Made friends with Viktor Krum , have you , Ron ? " Percy had bustled over , rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous . 
" Excellent ! 
That's the whole point , you know - international magical cooperation ! " 
The top table was now empty ; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout , Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall ; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students , and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen . 
When the next song ended , everybody applauded once more , and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds , at which point Fred and George accosted him . 
" What do they think they ' re doing , annoying senior Ministry members ? " 
Percy hissed , watching Fred and George suspiciously . 
" No respect ... " Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly , however , and , spotting Harry , waved and came over to their table . 
" I hope my brothers weren't bothering you , Mr . Bagman ? " said Percy at once . 
" What ? 
Oh not at all , not at all ! " said Bagman . 
" No , they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs . 
I ' ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko's Joke Shop . 
... " Percy didn't look happy about this at all , and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs . Weasley about this the moment he got home . 
Apparently Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately , if they were hoping to sell to the public . 
Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something , but Percy diverted him . 
" How do you feel the tournament's going , Mr . Bagman ? 
Our department's quite satisfied - the hitch with the Goblet of Fire " - he glanced at Harry - " was a little unfortunate , of course , but it seems to have gone very smoothly since , don't you think ? " 
" Oh yes , " Bagman said cheerfully , " it's all been enormous fun . 
How's old Barty doing ? 
" Oh I'm sure Mr . Crouch will be up and about in no time , " said Percy importantly , " but in the meantime , I'm more than willing to take up the slack . 
Of course , it's not all attending balls " - he laughed airily - " oh no , I ' ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence - you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country ? 
And then we ' ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling . 
Harry and Ron left the table , edged around the dance floor , and slipped out into the entrance hall . 
The front doors stood open , and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps , where they found themselves surrounded by bushes ; winding , ornamental paths ; and large stone statues . 
He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes , but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice . 
" Flee - I will make your excuses . 
I , however , am remaining at Hogwarts . " 
Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner . 
Karkaroff , Harry saw , looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there . 
His hand went nervously to his goatee , and he began winding it around his finger . 
" Not against the law , is it ? " 
Harry and Ron continued down the path . 
" What's got Karkaroff all worried ? " 
Ron muttered . 
Harry slowly . 
The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench , watching the water in the moonlight . 
And then Harry heard Hagrid speak . 
Harry and Ron froze . 
Harry looked around , back up the path , and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half - concealed in a rosebush nearby . 
He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them , meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed ( Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry ) , but Ron , eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur , shook his head vigorously , and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer . 
" What did you know , ' Agrid ? " said Madame Maxime , a purr in her low voice . 
Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this ; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this ( he certainly would have ) - if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly , but that wasn't really an option . 
Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer's back , but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to block out Hagrid's next words . 
" I jus ' knew . . . 
... " " It was my mother , " said Hagrid quietly . 
" She was one o ' the las ' ones in Britain . 
' Course , I can ' remember her too well . . . 
When I was abou ' three . 
Well . . . 
it's not in their natures , is it ? 
Dunno what happened to her . . . 
... " Madame Maxime didn't say anything . 
And Harry , in spite of himself , took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer's antlers , listening . 
He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before . 
By the time I was six I could lift him up an ' put him on top o ' the dresser if he annoyed me . 
Hagrid's deep voice broke . 
Madame Maxime was listening , motionless , apparently staring at the silvery fountain . 
but he died , o ' course , jus ' after I started school . 
Very kind ter me , he was . . . 
Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily . 
" So ... anyway . . . 
What about you ? 
" It is chilly , " she said - but whatever the weather was doing , it was nowhere near as cold as her voice . 
" I think I will go in now . " 
" Eh ? " said Hagrid blankly . 
" No , don go ! 
I ' ve - I ' ve never met another one before ! " 
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer ; he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth , hoping against hope he wouldn't - but it was no good . 
" ' Ow dare you ! " shrieked Madame Maxime . 
" I ' ave nevair been more insulted in my life ! 
I ' ave - I ' ave big bones ! " 
She stormed away ; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed , angrily pushing aside bushes . 
Hagrid was still sitting on the bench , staring after her . 
It was much too dark to make out his expression . 
Then , after about a minute , he stood up and strode away , not back to the castle , but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin . 
" C ' mon , " Harry said , very quietly to Ron . " Let's go . . . 
" What's up ? " said Harry , looking at him . 
Ron looked around at Harry , his expression very serious indeed . 
" Did you know ? " he whispered . 
" About Hagrid being half - giant ? " " No , " Harry said , shrugging . 
" So what ? " 
He knew immediately , from the look Ron was giving him , that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world . 
" I ' ll explain inside , " said Ron quietly , " c ' mon . . 
.. " Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared , probably into a more private clump of bushes . 
Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall . 
Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys , and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum . 
Harry and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor . 
" So ? " Harry prompted Ron . 
" What's the problem with giants ? " " Well , they ' re . . . 
they ' re . . 
Ron struggled for words . 
" Who cares ? " 
Harry said . 
" There's nothing wrong with Hagrid ! " " I know there isn't , but . . . 
" I always thought he'd got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something . 
... " " But what's it matter if his mother was a giantess ? " said Harry . 
" But . . . 
It's like Hagrid said , it's in their natures , they ' re like trolls . . . 
they just like killing , everyone knows that . 
" What happened to them ? " " Well , they were dying out anyway , and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors . 
They hide out in mountains mostly . . . 
. " " I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding , " Harry said , watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges ' table , looking very somber . 
Big bones . 
.. the only thing that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur . " 
Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner , neither of them having any inclination to dance . 
Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too much ; it gave him a strong desire to kick something . 
When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight , everyone gave them a last , loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall . 
Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer , but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed ; as far as he was concerned , the evening hadn't been much fun . 
Out in the entrance hall , Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship . 
She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking . 
Harry and Ron followed her , but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling him . 
" Hey - Harry ! " 
It was Cedric Diggory . 
Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below . 
" Yeah ? " said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him . 
" Listen ... " Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared . 
" I owe you one for telling me about the dragons . 
You know that golden egg ? 
Does yours wail when you open it ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Well ... take a bath , okay ? " " What ? " " Take a bath , and - er - take the egg with you , and - er - just mull things over in the hot water . 
It ' ll help you think . . . . 
Harry stared at him . 
Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor . 
Password's ' pine fresh . ' Gotta go ... want to say good night - " He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho . 
Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone . 
Was he trying to make Harry look like a fool , so Cho would like him even more by comparison ? 
The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole . 
He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row . 
Standing ten feet apart , they were bellowing at each other , each scarlet in the face . 
" Well , if you don't like it , you know what the solution is , don't you ? " yelled Hermione ; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now , and her face was screwed up in anger . 
" Oh yeah ? " Ron yelled back . 
" What's that ? " " Next time there's a ball , ask me before someone else does , and not as a last resort ! " 
Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls'staircase to bed . 
Ron turned to look at Harry . 
Harry didn't say anything . 
He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had . 
Hermione's hair was bushy again ; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion on it for the ball , " but it's way too much bother to do every day , " she said matter - of - factly , scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears . 
Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument . 
Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid , but Hermione didn't seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half - giant nearly as shocking as Ron did . 
" Well , I thought he must be , " she said , shrugging . 
" I knew he couldn't be pure giant because they ' re about twenty feet tall . 
It's the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves . . . . 
It's just bigotry , isn't it ? " 
It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays . 
Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over - everybody except Harry , that is , who was starting ( once again ) to feel slightly nervous . 
The trouble was that February the twenty - fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas , and he still hadn't done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg . 
He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory , opening it , and listening intently , hoping that this time it would make some sense . 
He strained to think what the sound reminded him of , apart from thirty musical saws , but he had never heard anything else like it . 
He closed the egg , shook it vigorously , and opened it again to see if the sound had changed , but it hadn't . 
He tried asking the egg questions , shouting over all the wailing , but nothing happened . 
He even threw the egg across the room - though he hadn't really expected that to help . 
Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him , but his less - thanfriendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it . 
In any case , it seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand , he would have been a lot more explicit . 
He , Harry , had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric's idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath . 
And so the first day of the new term arrived , and Harry set off to lessons , weighed down with books , parchment , and quills as usual , but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach , as though he were carrying that around with him too . 
Snow was still thick upon the grounds , and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn't see out of them in Herbology . 
" Hurry up , now , the bell rang five minutes ago , " she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow . 
" Who ' re you ? " said Ron , staring at her . " Wheres Hagrid ? " " My name is Professor Grubbly - Plank , " she said briskly . 
" I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher . " 
" Where's Hagrid ? " 
Harry repeated loudly . 
" He is indisposed , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank shortly . 
He turned ; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class . 
All of them looked gleeful , and none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly - Plank . 
" This way , please , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank , and she strode off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione followed her , looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid's cabin . 
Was Hagrid in there , alone and ill ? " What's wrong with Hagrid ? " 
Harry said , hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly - Plank . 
" I do mind , though , " said Harry hotly . 
" What's up with him ? " 
Professor Grubbly - Plank acted as though she couldn't hear him . 
She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing , huddled against the cold , and toward a tree on the edge of the forest , where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered . 
Many of the girls " ooooohed ! " at the sight of the unicorn . 
" Oh it's so beautiful ! " 
whispered Lavender Brown . 
" How did she get it ? 
They're supposed to be really hard to catch ! " 
The unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray . 
Girls to the front , and approach with care , come on , easy does it . 
... " She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn , leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence , watching . 
The moment Professor Grubbly - Plank was out of earshot . 
Harry turned to Ron . " What d ' you reckons wrong with him ? 
" No , he's just too ashamed to show his big , ugly face . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " said Harry sharply . 
Malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint . 
" There you go , " he said . 
" Hate to break it to you . 
Potter . 
... " He smirked as Harry snatched the page , unfolded it , and read it , with Ron , Seamus , Dean , and Neville looking over his shoulder . 
DUMBLEDORE ' S GIANT MISTAKE Albus Dumbledore , eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments , writes Rita Skeeter , Special Correspondent . 
In September of this year , he hired Alastor " Mad - Eye " Moody , the notoriously jinx - happy ex - Auror , to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts , a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic , given Moody's well - known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence . 
Mad - Eye Moody , however , looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part - human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures . 
Rubeus Hagrid , who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year , has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since , a job secured for him by Dumbledore . 
Last year , however , Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher , over the heads of many better - qualified candidates . 
An alarmingly large and ferocious - looking man , Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures . 
While Dumbledore turns a blind eye , Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being " very frightening . " 
' I was attacked by a hippogriff , and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm , " says Draco Malfoy , a fourth - year student . 
" We all hate Hagrid , but we ' re just too scared to say anything . " 
The creation of new breeds of magical creature is , of course , an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . 
His mother , we can exclusively reveal , is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa , whose whereabouts are currently unknown . 
Bloodthirsty and brutal , the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century . 
The handful that remained joined the ranks of He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named , and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror . 
While many of the giants who served He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side , Fridwulfa was not among them . 
In a bizarre twist , Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You - Know - Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother , like the rest of You - Know - Who's supporters , into hiding . 
Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter , along with his fellow students , is warned about the dangers of associating with part - giants . 
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron , whose mouth was hanging open . 
But that wasn't what was bothering Harry . 
" What d ' you mean , ' we all hate Hagrid ' ? " 
Harry spat at Malfoy . 
and there was me thinking he'd just swallowed a bottle of Skele - Gro when he was young . 
... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all . 
... " " You - " " Are you paying attention over there ? " 
Professor Grubbly - Planks voice carried over to the boys ; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now , stroking it . 
Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn , whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly - Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice , so that the boys could hear too . 
" I hope she stays , that woman ! " said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch . 
. " " What about Hagrid ? " 
Harry said angrily as they went up the steps . 
" What about him ? " said Parvati in a hard voice . 
She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip . 
" That was a really good lesson , " said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall . 
Hermione's mouth fell open as she read . 
Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron's . 
You don't think Hagrid told her ? " " No , " said Harry , leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair , furious . 
" He never even told us , did he ? 
I reckon she was so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me , she went ferreting around to get him back . " 
" Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball , " said Hermione quietly . 
" We'd have seen her in the garden ! " said Ron . " Anyway , she's not supposed to come into school anymore , Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her . . . 
" Like you and Ron did , you mean , " said Hermione . 
" We weren't trying to hear him ! " said Ron indignantly . 
Tell him we want him back . . . 
you do want him back ? " he shot at Hermione . 
" I - well , I'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change , having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once - but I do want Hagrid back , of course I do ! " Hermione added hastily , quailing under Harry's furious stare . 
So that evening after dinner , the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid's cabin . 
" Hagrid , it's us ! " 
Harry shouted , pounding on the door . 
" Open up ! " Hagrid didn't answer . 
They could hear Fang scratching at the door , whining , but it didn't open . 
They hammered on it for ten more minutes ; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows , but there was no response . 
" What's he avoiding us for ? " 
Hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school . 
" He surely doesn't think we'd care about him being half - giant ? " 
But it seemed that Hagrid did care . 
He didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes , they didn't see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds , and Professor Grubbly - Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes . 
" Missing your half - breed pal ? " he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around , so that he was safe from Harry's retaliation . 
" Missing the elephantman ? " 
Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go . 
" Really get to work on that egg . " " Oh I - I reckon I ' ve got a pretty good idea what it's about now , " Harry lied . 
" Have you really ? " said Hermione , looking impressed . 
whereas if he went into Hogsmeade , he might run into Hagrid , and get a chance to persuade him to come back . 
He , Ron , and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold , wet grounds toward the gates . 
As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake , they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck , dressed in nothing but swimming trunks . 
He was very skinny indeed , but apparently a lot tougher than he looked , because he climbed up onto the side of the ship , stretched out his arms , and dived , right into the lake . 
" He's mad ! " said Harry , staring at Krums dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake . 
" It must be freezing , it's January ! " " It's a lot colder where he comes from , " said Hermione . 
" Yeah , but there's still the giant squid , " said Ron . 
Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned . 
" He's really nice , you know , " she said . 
" He's not at all like you'd think , coming from Durmstrang . 
He likes it much better here , he told me . " 
Ron said nothing . 
He hadn't mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball , but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day , which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes . 
Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street , and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops . 
The pub was as crowded as ever , but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn't there . 
Heart sinking , he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione , ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta , and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all . 
" Doesn't he ever go into the office ? " 
Hermione whispered suddenly . 
" Look ! " 
She pointed into the mirror behind the bar , and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there , sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins . 
Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins , all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing . 
Harry thought , that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event , and therefore no judging to be done . 
He watched Bagman in the mirror . 
He was looking strained again , quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared . 
But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar , saw Harry , and stood up . 
" In a moment , in a moment ! " 
Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins , and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry , his boyish grin back in place . 
" Harry ! " he said . 
" How are you ? 
Everything going all right ? " 
" Fine , thanks , " said Harry . 
" You couldn't give us a moment , you two , could you ? " " Er - okay , " said Ron , and he and Hermione went off to find a table . 
Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta . 
" Well , I just thought I'd congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail , Harry , " said Bagman . 
" Really superb . " 
" Thanks , " said Harry , but he knew this couldn't be all that Bagman wanted to say , because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione . 
Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins , who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark , slanting eyes . 
" Absolute nightmare , " said Bagman to Harry in an undertone , noticing Harry watching the goblins too . 
it's like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . 
Bladvak . 
It means ' pickax . ' 
I don't like to use it in case they think I'm threatening them . " 
" What do they want ? " 
Harry said , noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely . 
" Er - well . . 
. " said Bagman , looking suddenly nervous . 
" They ... er ... they ' re looking for Barty Crouch . " 
" Why are they looking for him here ? " said Harry . 
" He's at the Ministry in London , isn't he ? " " Er ... as a matter of fact , I ' ve no idea where he is , " said Bagman . 
Young Percy , his assistant , says he's ill . 
Apparently he's just been sending instructions in by owl . 
But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone . 
Harry ? 
" Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins ? " 
Harry asked . 
" No , " said Bagman , looking strained again . 
She definitely arrived in Albania , because she met her second cousin there . 
And then she left the cousin's house to go south and see an aunt . . . 
Blowed if I can see where she's got to ... she doesn't seem the type to elope , for instance . . . 
but still . . . . 
What are we doing , talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins ? 
I really wanted to ask you " - he lowered his voice - " how are you getting on with your golden egg ? " " Er . . . 
not bad , " Harry said untruthfully . 
" Listen , Harry , " he said ( still in a very low voice ) , " I feel very bad about all this . . . 
you were thrown into this tournament , you didn't volunteer for it ... and if . . 
. " ( his voice was so quiet now , Harry had to lean closer to listen ) " if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction . . . 
I ' ve taken a liking to you . . . the way you got past that dragon ! . . . 
Harry stared up into Bagman's round , rosy face and his wide , baby - blue eyes . 
" We're supposed to work out the clues alone , aren't we ? " he said , careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules . 
" Well . . . 
well , yes , " said Bagman impatiently , " but - come on . 
Harry - we all want a Hogwarts victory , don't we ? " " Have you offered Cedric help ? " 
Harry said . 
" No , I haven't , " he said . 
" I - well , like I say , I ' ve taken a liking to you . 
Just thought I'd offer ... " " Well , thanks , " said Harry , " but I think I'm nearly there with the egg . . . 
He wasn't entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman's help , except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him , and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron , Hermione , or Sirius . 
Bagman looked almost affronted , but couldn't say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point . 
" Hello , Mr . Bagman , " said Fred brightly . 
" Can we buy you a drink ? " " Er . . . 
no , " said Bagman , with a last disappointed glance at Harry , " no , thank you , boys ... " Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman , who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly . 
" Well , I must dash , " he said . 
" Nice seeing you all . 
Good luck , Harry . " 
He hurried out of the pub . 
Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione . 
" What did he want ? " 
Ron said , the moment Harry had sat down . 
" He offered to help me with the golden egg , " said Harry . 
" He shouldn't be doing that ! " said Hermione , looking very shocked . 
" He's one of the judges ! 
nearly , " said Harry . 
" Well , I don't think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat ! " said Hermione , still looking deeply disapproving . 
" I hope he's trying to help Cedric as much ! " " He's not , I asked , " said Harry . 
" Who cares if Diggorys getting help ? " said Ron . 
Harry privately agreed . 
" What were they doing here ? " 
" Looking for Crouch , according to Bagman , " said Harry . 
" He's still ill . 
They'd normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . " 
" Worrying about poor ' ickle goblins , now , are you ? " 
Ron asked Hermione . 
" Well , the / re quite capable of dealing with wizards , " said Hermione , taking another sip of butterbeer . 
" Uh - oh , " said Ron , staring at the door . 
Rita Skeeter had just entered . 
She bought drinks , and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione glaring at her as she approached . 
She was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something . 
" ... didn't seem very keen to talk to us , did he , Bozo ? 
Now , why would that be , do you think ? 
Showing them the sights . 
.. what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar . 
Reckon something's up ? 
' Disgraced Ex - Head of Magical Games and Sports , Ludo Bagman . . 
. ' Snappy start to a sentence , Bozo - we just need to find a story to fit it - " " Trying to ruin someone else's life ? " said Harry loudly . 
A few people looked around . 
Rita Skeeter's eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken . 
" Harry ! " she said , beaming . 
" How lovely ! 
" What did you do that to Hagrid for , eh ? " Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows . 
" Our readers have a right to the truth , Harry . 
Harry shouted . 
" There's nothing wrong with him ! " 
Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar , apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing . 
Harry ? 
The man behind the muscles ? 
Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it . 
Would you call him a father substitute ? " Hermione stood up very abruptly , her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade . 
" You horrible woman , " she said , through gritted teeth , " you don't care , do you , anything for a story , and anyone will do , wont they ? 
" I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl ... not that it needs it - " she added , eyeing Hermione's bushy hair . 
" Let's go , " said Hermione , " c ' mon . 
Harry - Ron . 
.. " They left ; many people were staring at them as they went . 
Harry glanced back as they reached the door . 
Rita Skeeter's Quick - Quotes Quill was out ; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table . 
" Let her try ! " said Hermione defiantly ; she was shaking with rage . 
" I ' ll show her ! Silly little girl , am I ? Oh , I ' ll get her back for this . 
First Harry , then Hagrid ... " " You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter , " said Ron nervously . 
" I'm serious , Hermione , she ' ll dig up something on you - " " My parents don't read the Daily Prophet . 
She can't scare me into hiding ! " said Hermione , now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her . 
The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this , she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face . 
Come on ! " Breaking into a run , she led them all the way back up the road , through the gates flanked by winged boars , and up through the grounds to Hagrid's cabin . 
The curtains were still drawn , and they could hear Fang barking as they approached . 
" Hagrid ! " Hermione shouted , pounding on his front door . 
" Hagrid , that's enough ! 
We know you ' re in there ! 
" We - er - we wanted to see Hagrid , " said Hermione in a rather small voice . 
" Why don't you come in ? " " Oh . . . 
um ... okay , " said Hermione . 
She , Ron , and Harry went into the cabin ; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered , barking madly and trying to lick his ears . 
Harry fended off Fang and looked around . 
Hagrid was sitting at his table , where there were two large mugs of tea . 
He looked a real mess . 
His face was blotchy , his eyes swollen , and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned ; far from trying to make it behave , it now looked like a wig of tangled wire . 
" Hi , Hagrid , " said Harry . 
Hagrid looked up . 
" ' Lo , " he said in a very hoarse voice . 
" More tea , I think , " said Dumbledore , closing the door behind Harry , Ron , and Hermione , drawing out his wand , and twiddling it ; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes . 
Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table , and everybody sat down . 
There was a slight pause , and then Dumbledore said , " Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting , Hagrid ? " Hermione went slightly pink , but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued , " Hermione , Harry , and Ron still seem to want to know you , judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door . " 
" Of course we still want to know you ! " Harry said , staring at Hagrid . 
" I have gone temporarily deaf and haven't any idea what you said . 
Harry , " said Dumbledore , twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling . 
" Er - right , " said Harry sheepishly . 
" Living proof of what I ' ve been telling you , Hagrid , " said Dumbledore , still looking carefully up at the ceiling . 
" I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here , telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you , they would have something to say about it - " 
" Not all of ' em , " said Hagrid hoarsely . 
" Not all of ' em wan me ter stay . " 
" Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven't had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it . 
But what should I do ? 
Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody ? " " Yeh - yeh ' re not half - giant ! " said Hagrid croakily . 
" Hagrid , look what I ' ve got for relatives ! " 
Harry said furiously . 
" Look at the Dursleys ! " 
" An excellent point , " said Professor Dumbledore . 
" My own brother , Aberforth , was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat . 
No , he did not ! 
He held his head high and went about his business as usual ! 
Of course , I'm not entirely sure he can read , so that may not have been bravery . . 
Hagrid gulped . 
More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard . 
Dumbledore stood up . 
" I refuse to accept your resignation , Hagrid , and I expect you back at work on Monday , " he said . 
No excuses . 
Good afternoon to you all . " 
Dumbledore left the cabin , pausing only to scratch Fangs ears . 
When the door had shut behind him , Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin - lid - sized hands . 
Hermione kept patting his arm , and at last , Hagrid looked up , his eyes very red indeed , and said , " Great man , Dumbledore . . . 
great man . 
.. " " Yeah , he is , " said Ron . " Can I have one of these cakes , Hagrid ? " " Help yerself , " said Hagrid , wiping his eyes on the back of his hand . 
. I bin stupid . 
More tears leaked out , but he wiped them away more forcefully , and said , " Never shown you a picture of my old dad , have I ? Here ... " Hagrid got up , went over to his dresser , opened a drawer , and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid's crinkled black eyes , beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid's shoulder . 
Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall , judging by the apple tree beside him , but his face was beardless , young , round , and smooth - he looked hardly older than eleven . 
. " " Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went . 
trusts people , he does . 
But some don understand that . 
there's some who'd even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an'say - I am what I am , an ' I'm not ashamed . 
I'm not botherin ' with her no more , I promise yeh that . 
Big bones . . . 
I ' ll give her big bones . " 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at one another nervously ; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast - Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime , but Hagrid was still talking , apparently unaware that he had said anything odd . 
School champion ! " 
He looked at Harry for a moment and then said , very seriously , " Yeh know what I'd love . 
Harry ? 
I'd love yeh ter win , I really would . 
It'd show ' em Dumbledore's the one who's got it righ ' , lettin ' anyone in as long as they can do magic . 
How you doin ' with that egg , Harry ? " " Great , " said Harry . 
" Really great . " 
Hagrid's miserable face broke into a wide , watery smile . 
you show ' em , Harry , you show ' em . 
Lying to Hagrid wasn't quite like lying to anyone else . 
Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione , unable to banish the image of the happy expression on Hagrid's whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tournament . 
The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on Harrys conscience that evening , and by the time he had got into bed , he had made up his mind - it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric's hint was worth anything . 
CHAPTER TWENTY - FIVE : THE EGG AND THE EYE 
Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg , he decided to do it at night , when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted . 
Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric , he also decided to use the prefects ' bathroom ; far fewer people were allowed in there , so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed . 
Harry planned his excursion carefully , because he had been caught out of bed and out - of - bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before , and had no desire to repeat the experience . 
The Invisibility Cloak would , of course , be essential , and as an added precaution , Harry thought he would take the Marauders Map , which , next to the cloak , was the most useful aid to rule - breaking Harry owned . 
The map showed the whole of Hogwarts , including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and , most important of all , it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule , labeled dots , moving around the corridors , so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom . 
On Thursday night , Harry sneaked up to bed , put on the cloak , crept back downstairs , and , just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons , waited for the portrait hole to open . 
This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password ( " banana fritters " ) , " Good luck , " Ron muttered , climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him . 
It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight , because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other . 
However , the moonlit corridors were empty and silent , and by checking the map at strategic intervals , Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn't run into anyone he wanted to avoid . 
When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered , a lost - looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands , he located the right door , leaned close to it , and muttered the password , " Pine fresh , " just as Cedric had told him . 
The door creaked open . 
Harry slipped inside , bolted the door behind him , and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak , looking around . 
His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom . 
It was softly lit by a splendid candle - filled chandelier , and everything was made of white marble , including what looked like an empty , rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor . 
About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges , each with a differently colored Jewel set into its handle . 
There was also a diving board . 
Long white linen curtains hung at the windows ; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner , and there was a single golden - framed painting on the wall . 
It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock , her long hair over her face . 
Harry moved forward , looking around , his footsteps echoing off the walls . 
Magnificent though the bathroom was - and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps - now he was here he couldn't quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on . 
How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg ? 
Nevertheless , he put one of the Huffy towels , the cloak , the map , and the egg at the side of the swimming - pool - sized bath , then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps . 
One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs ; another poured ice - white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he'd cared to test it ; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water . 
Harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off , particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs . 
Then , when the deep pool was full of hot water , foam , and bubbles , which took a very short time considering its size , Harry turned off all the taps , pulled off his pajamas , slippers , and dressing gown , and slid into the water . 
It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom , and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water , staring at the egg . 
Harry stretched out his arms , lifted the egg in his wet hands , and opened it . 
The wailing , screeching sound filled the bathroom , echoing and reverberating off the marble walls , but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever , if not more so with all the echoes . 
He snapped it shut again , worried that the sound would attract Filch , wondering whether that hadn't been Cedric's plan - and then , making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg , which clattered away across the bathroom floor , someone spoke . 
" I'd try putting it in the water , if I were you . " 
Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock . 
He stood up , sputtering , and saw the ghost of a very glum - looking girl sitting cross - legged on top of one of the taps . 
" Myrtle ! " 
Harry said in outrage , " I'm - I'm not wearing anything ! " 
The foam was so dense that this hardly mattered , but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived . 
" I closed my eyes when you got in , " she said , blinking at him through her thick spectacles . 
" Yeah . . . 
well . . 
" You didn't used to care , " said Myrtle miserably . 
" You used to be in there all the time . " 
This was true , though only because Harry , Ron , and Hermione had found Myrtle's out - of - order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret - a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour , so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room . 
" I got told off for going in there . " said Harry , which was half - true ; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtles bathroom . 
" I thought I'd better not come back after that . " 
" Oh ... I see ... " said Myrtle , picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way . 
" Well ... anyway ... I'd try the egg in the water . 
" What d ' you do , sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths ? " " Sometimes , " said Myrtle , rather slyly , " but I ' ve never come out to speak to anyone before . " 
" I'm honored , " said Harry darkly . 
" You keep your eyes shut ! " 
He made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath , wrapping the towel firmly around his waist , and going to retrieve the egg . 
Once he was back in the water , Myrtle peered through her fingers and said , " Go on , then . 
.. open it under the water ! " 
Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it ... and this time , it did not wail . 
" Go on ! " 
Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface - and now , sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble - filled bath , he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands : " Come seek us where our voices sound , We cannot sing above the ground , And while you re searching , ponder this : 
" Hear it ? " said Myrtle . 
" Yeah ... ' Come seek us where our voices sound .. . ' and if I need persuading ... hang on , I need to listen again .... " 
He sank back beneath the water . 
" I ' ve got to go and look for people who can't use their voices above the ground . . . 
. " he said slowly . 
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful , apart from the day when a dose of PolyJuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat . 
Harry stared around the bathroom , thinking ... if the voices could only be heard underwater , then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures . 
nearly all the bubbles had gone . 
... " " Underwater ... " Harry said slowly . 
" Myrtle . . . 
what lives in the lake , apart from the giant squid ? " " Oh all sorts , " she said . 
" I sometimes go down there . . . 
sometimes don't have any choice , if someone flushes my toilet when I'm not expecting it .... " Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet . 
Harry said , " Well , does anything in there have a human voice ? 
Hang on - " Harry's eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall . 
" Myrtle , there aren't merpeople in there , are there ? " 
And that was with her awake too " - Myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face " giggling and showing off and flashing her fins .. .. " " Thats it , isn't it ? " said Harry excitedly . 
" The second tasks to go and find the merpeople in the lake and ... and ... " But he suddenly realized what he was saying , and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach . 
Dudley had had lessons in his youth , but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon , no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day , hadn't bothered to give him any . 
" Myrtle , " Harry said slowly , " how am I supposed to breathe ? " 
At this , Myrtle's eyes filled with sudden tears again . 
" What's tactless ? " said Harry , bewildered . 
" Talking about breathing in front of me ! " she said shrilly , and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom . 
" When I can't . . . 
not for ages ... " She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly . 
" Sorry , " he said impatiently . 
" I didn't mean - I just forgot . . 
. " " Oh yes , very easy to forget Myrtle's dead , " said Myrtle , gulping , looking at him out of swollen eyes . 
" Nobody missed me even when I was alive . 
Took them hours and hours to find my body - I know , I was sitting there waiting for them . 
Olive Hornby came into the bathroom - Are you in here again , sulking , Myrtle ?'she said , ' because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you - ' And then she saw my body . . . 
I remember at her brother's wedding - " But Harry wasn't listening ; he was thinking about the merpeople's song again . 
" We ' ve taken what you II sorely miss . " 
That sounded as though they were going to steal something of his , something he had to get back . 
What were they going to take ? 
" -- and then , of course , she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her , so I had to come back here and live in my toilet . " 
" Good , " said Harry vaguely . 
" Well , I'm a lot further on than I was . . . . 
Shut your eyes again , will you ? 
I'm getting out . " 
He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath , climbed out , dried himself , and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again . 
" Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime ? " 
Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak . 
I ' ll try , " Harry said , though privately thinking the only way he'd be visiting Myrtle's bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked . 
" See you . 
" Bye , ' bye , " she said gloomily , and as Harry put on the Invisibllity Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap . 
Out in the dark corridor , Harry examined the Marauders Map to check that the coast was still clear . 
.. nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves , though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above . 
... Harry had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye . . . 
Peeves was not the only thing that was moving . 
A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left - hand corner - Snapes office . 
But the dot wasn't labeled " Severus Snape " ... it was Bartemius Crouch . 
Harry stared at the dot . 
Mr . Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball - so what was he doing , sneaking into Hogwarts at one o ' clock in the morning ? 
Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room , pausing here and there . 
... Harry hesitated , thinking . . . 
and then his curiosity got the better of him . 
He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase . 
He was going to see what Crouch was up to . 
Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible , though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard , the rustle of his pajamas . 
He kept glancing down at the map , wondering ... It just didn't seem in character , somehow , for correct , law - abiding Mr . Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else's office this late at night .... 
And then , halfway down the staircase , not thinking about what he was doing , not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr . Crouch , Harrys leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump . 
He gave an ungainly wobble , and the golden egg , still damp from the bath , slipped from under his arm . 
He lurched forward to try and catch it , but too late ; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step - the Invisibility Cloak slipped - Harry snatched at it , and the Marauder s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs , where , sunk in the step to above his knee , he couldn't reach it . 
The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase , burst open , and began wailing loudly in the corridor below . 
Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder s Map , to wipe it blank , but it was too far away to reach Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up , listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear . . . 
and , almost immediately " PEEVES ! " 
It was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker . 
" What's this racket ? 
Wake up the whole castle , will you ? 
I ' ll have you , Peeves , I ' ll have you , you ' ll ... and what is this ? " Filch's footsteps halted ; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped - Filch had picked up the egg and closed it . 
Harry stood very still , one leg still Jammed tightly in the magical step , listening . 
Any moment now , Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry , expecting to see Peeves . . . 
and there would be no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs , he would spot the Marauder's Map . . . 
and Invisibility Cloak or not , the map would show " Harry Potter " standing exactly where he was . 
" Egg ? " Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs . 
This belongs to a school champion ! " 
" You ' ve been stealing ! " 
He ripped back the tapestry below , and Harry saw his horrible , pouchy face and bulging , pale eyes staring up the dark and ( to Filch ) deserted staircase . 
" Hiding , are you ? " he said softly . 
" I'm coming to get you , Peeves . . . . 
Dumbledore ' ll have you out of here for this , you filthy , pilfering poltergeist . 
... " Filch started to climb the stairs , his scrawny , dust - colored cat at his heels . 
" Filch ? 
Whats going on ? " Filch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned . 
At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry's situation worse : Snape . 
He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid . 
" Its Peeves , Professor , " Filch whispered malevolently . 
" He threw this egg down the stairs . " 
Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch . 
Harry gritted his teeth , convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second . . . . 
" Peeves ? " said Snape softly , staring at the egg in Filch's hands . 
" But Peeves couldn't get into my office . . . 
. " " This egg was in your office . 
Professor ? " 
" Of course not , " Snape snapped . 
" I heard banging and wailing - " " Yes , Professor , that was the egg - " " - I was coming to investigate - " " - Peeves threw it . 
Professor - " " - and when I passed my office , I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar ! 
" I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break ! " 
Snape looked up the stairs , straight through Harry , and then down into the corridor below . 
" I want you to come and help me search for the intruder , Filch . " 
" I - yes , Professor - but - " Filch looked yearningly up the stairs , right through Harry , who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves . 
go . . . 
" The thing is , Professor , " said Filch plaintively , " the headmaster will have to listen to me this time . 
Snape stopped talking very abruptly . 
He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs . 
Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual . 
" Pajama party , is it ? " 
he growled up the stairs . 
" Professor Snape and I heard noises , Professor , " said Filch at once . 
" Peeves the Poltergeist , throwing things around as usual - and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off - " " Shut up ! " Snape hissed to Filch . 
Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs . 
Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene : Snape in his nightshirt , Filch clutching the egg , and he , Harry , trapped in the stairs behind them . 
For a few seconds , he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes . 
Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again . 
" Did I hear that correctly , Snape ? " he asked slowly . 
" Someone broke into your office ? " " It is unimportant , " said Snape coldly . 
" On the contrary , " growled Moody , " it is very important . 
Who'd want to break into your office ? " " A student , I daresay , " said Snape . 
Harry saw the edge of Snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color , the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly . 
Moodys face twisted into a smile . 
" Auror's privilege , Snape . 
Dumbledore told me to keep an eye - " " Dumbledore happens to trust me , " said Snape through clenched teeth . 
" I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office ! " " Course Dumbledore trusts you , " growled Moody . 
He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand , as though something on it had hurt him . 
Moody laughed . 
" You don't have the authority to send me anywhere ! " 
Snape hissed , letting go of his arm as though angry with himself . 
" I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time .... You ' ve dropped something , by the way . 
Harry saw Moody point at the Marauders Map , still lying on the staircase six steps below him . 
As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it , Harry threw caution to the winds ; he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention , mouthing " It's mine ! 
The map flew up into the air , slipped through Snapes outstretched fingers , and soared down the stairs into Moodys hand . 
" My mistake , " Moody said calmly . 
" It's mine - must ' ve dropped it earlier - " But Snape's black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch's arms to the map in Moodys hand , and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together , as only Snape could . . . . 
" Potter , " he said quietly . 
" What's that ? " said Moody calmly , folding up the map and pocketing it . 
" Potter ! " Snape snarled , and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was , as though he could suddenly see him . 
" That egg is Potters egg . 
That piece of parchment belongs to Potter . 
I have seen it before , I recognize it ! 
Potter is here ! 
Potter , in his Invisibility Cloak ! " Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs ; Harry could have sworn his over - large nostrils were dilating , trying to sniff Harry out - trapped . 
Harry leaned backward , trying to avoid Snapes fingertips , but any moment now " There's nothing there , Snape ! " barked Moody , " but I ' ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter ! " 
" Meaning what ? " Snape turned again to look at Moody , his hands still outstretched , inches from Harry's chest . 
" Meaning that Dumbledore's very interested to know who's got it in for that boy ! " said Moody , limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs . 
" And so am I , Snape . . . 
Snape was looking down at Moody , and Harry couldn't see the expression on his face . 
For a moment , nobody moved or said anything . 
Then Snape slowly lowered his hands . 
" I merely thought , " said Snape , in a voice of forced calm , " that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ... it's an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped . 
" Ah , I see , " said Moody softly . 
There was a pause . 
Snape and Moody were still staring at each other , Mrs . Norris gave a loud meow , still peering around Filch's legs , looking for the source of Harry's bubble - bath smell . 
" I think I will go back to bed , " Snape said curtly . 
" Now , Filch , if you ' ll just give me that egg - " " No ! " said Filch , clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son . 
" Professor Moody , this is evidence of Peeves ' treachery ! " 
" It's the property of the champion he stole it from , " said Moody . 
Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs . Norris , who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master . 
Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor ; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too , muttering to Mrs . Norris . 
Potter , " he muttered . 
" Yeah ... I - er ... thanks , " said Harry weakly . 
" What is this thing ? " said Moody , drawing the Marauder's Map out of his pocket and unfolding it . 
" Map of Hogwarts , " said Harry , hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon ; his leg was really hurting him . 
" Merlins beard , " Moody whispered , staring at the map , his magical eye going haywire . 
" This . 
.. this is some map . 
Potter ! " " Yeah , its . . . 
quite useful , " Harry said . 
" Er - Professor Moody , d ' you think you could help me - ? " " What ? 
Oh ! Yes . . . 
yes , of course . 
.. " Moody took hold of Harrys arms and pulled ; Harrys leg came free of the trick step , and he climbed onto the one above it . 
Moody was still gazing at the map . 
" Potter ... " he said slowly , " you didn't happen , by any chance , to see who broke into Snapes office , did you ? 
yeah , I did . . 
Harry admitted . 
" It was Mr . Crouch . " 
Moodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map . 
He looked suddenly alarmed . 
" Crouch ? " he said . 
" You ' re - you ' re sure . 
Potter ? " " Positive , " said Harry . 
" Well , he's not here anymore , " said Moody , his eye still whizzing over the map . 
" Crouch . 
.. that's very - very interesting ... . " 
He said nothing for almost a minute , still staring at the map . 
Harry could tell that this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was . 
He wondered whether he dared ask . 
" Er ... Professor Moody . . . 
Moodys magical eye left the map and fixed , quivering , upon Harry . 
It was a penetrating glare , and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up , wondering whether to answer or not , or how much to tell him . 
but I'm nothing - nothing - compared to Barty Crouch . " 
He continued to stare at the map . 
Harry was burning to know more . 
" Professor Moody ? " he said again . 
" D ' you think ... could this have anything to do with . . . 
maybe Mr . Crouch thinks there's something going on . 
" Like what ? " said Moody sharply . 
Harry wondered how much he dare say . 
He didn't want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts ; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius . 
It's been in the Daily Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup , and the Death Eaters and everything .... " Both of Moody's mismatched eyes widened . 
" You ' re a sharp boy . 
Potter , " he said . 
" Crouch could be thinking along those lines , " he said slowly . 
" Very possible . . . 
there have been some funny rumors flying around lately helped along by Rita Skeeter , of course . 
It's making a lot of people nervous , I reckon . " 
A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth . 
" Oh if there's one thing I hate , " he muttered , more to himself than to Harry , and his magical eye was fixed on the left - hand corner of the map , " its a Death Eater who walked free . 
... " Harry stared at him . 
" And now I want to ask you a question . 
Potter , " said Moody in a more businesslike tone . 
Harrys heart sank ; he had thought this was coming . 
Moody was going to ask where he had got this map , which was a very dubious magical object - and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him , but his own father , Fred and George Weasley , and Professor Lupin , their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . 
Moody waved the map in front of Harry , who braced himself " Can I borrow this ? " " Oh ! " said Harry . 
He was very fond of his map , but on the other hand , he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn't asking where he'd got it , and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor . 
" Yeah , okay . " 
" Good boy , " growled Moody . 
.. this might be exactly what I ' ve been looking for . . . . 
Right , bed , Potter , come on , now . 
... " They climbed to the top of the stairs together , Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before . 
They walked in silence to the door of Moody's office , where he stopped and looked up at Harry . 
" No , " said Harry , taken aback . 
" You want to consider it , " said Moody , nodding and looking at Harry thoughtfully . 
" I ' ve been working out the clue . " 
Moody winked at him , his magical eye going haywire again . 
.. See you in the morning .... " 
He went back into his office , staring down at the Marauders Map again , and closed the door behind him . 
Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower , lost in thought about Snape , and Crouch , and what it all meant .... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill , if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to ? 
What did he think Snape was concealing in his office ? 
And Moody thought he . 
Harry , ought to be an Auror ! 
Harry thought , as he got quietly into his four - poster ten minutes later , the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk , he thought he'd like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career . 
You said you'd already worked out that egg clue ! " said Hermione indignantly . 
" Keep your voice down ! " said Harry crossly . 
He , Ron , and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves . 
They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm . 
Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room . 
Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice , the theory being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target . 
Neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room - Professor Flitwick , for instance . 
" Just forget the egg for a minute , all right ? " 
" I'm trying to tell you about Snape and Moody . 
Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour . 
" Snape said Moodys searched his office as well ? " 
Ron whispered , his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand ( it soared into the air and knocked Parvati's hat off ) . 
" What . . . 
" Well , I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do , but he's definitely doing it , " said Harry , waving his wand without paying much attention , so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk . 
" Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he's giving him a second chance or something . 
... " " What ? " said Ron , his eyes widening , his next cushion spinning high into the air , ricocheting off the chandelier , and dropping heavily onto Flitwick's desk . 
" Harry ... maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire ! " " Oh Ron , " said Hermione , shaking her head sceptically , " we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before , and it turned out he was saving Harry's life , remember ? " 
She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at . 
Harry looked at Hermione , thinking ... it was true that Snape had saved his life once , but the odd thing was , Snape definitely loathed him , just as he'd loathed Harry s father when they had been at school together . 
" Dumbledore's not stupid . 
" Its a bit funny , isn't it , that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball , but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to ? " " You just don't like Crouch because of that elf , Winky , " said Ron , sending a cushion soaring into the window . 
" I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance , if he's on his second one , " said Harry grimly , and his cushion , to his very great surprise , flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione's . 
Obedient to Sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts , Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night , explaining all about Mr . Crouch breaking into Snape s office , and Moody and Snape's conversation . 
Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him : how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty - fourth of February . 
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again - Harry had explained about Aqua - Lungs , and Ron couldn't see why Harry shouldn't Summon one from the nearest Muggle town . 
Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that , in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an AquaLung within the set limit of an hour , he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy - it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua - Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts . 
" Of course , the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something , " Hermione said . 
" If only we'd done human Transfiguration already ! 
" I s ' pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody ; he might do it for me .... " " I don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into , though , " said Hermione seriously . 
" No , I think your best chance is some sort of charm . " 
So Harry , thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime , buried himself once more among the dusty volumes , looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen . 
However , though he , Ron , and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes , evenings , and whole weekends though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section , and even asked the irritable , vulture - like librarian . 
The lake , which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds , drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window , a great , iron - gray mass of chilly water , whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon . 
Just as it had before he faced the Horntail , time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra - fast . 
there were five days to go ( he was bound to find something soon ) .. . 
Harry started to go off food again . 
The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius . 
He pulled off the parchment , unrolled it , and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him . 
Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back , hoping to see something else , but it was blank . 
" Weekend after next , " whispered Hermione , who had read the note over Harrys shoulder . 
Harry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius's letter , tied it onto the brown owl's leg , and watched it take flight again . 
What had he expected ? 
Advice on how to survive underwater ? 
" What's he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for ? " said Ron . " Dunno , " said Harry dully . 
The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died . 
" Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures . " 
Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast - Ended Skrewts , or because there were now only two skrewts left , or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly - Plank could . 
Today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals . 
Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them , and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them . 
" Easier ter spot than the adults , " Hagrid told the class . 
" They turn silver when they ' re abou ' two years old , an'they grow horns at aroun four . 
" You okay . 
Harry ? " Hagrid muttered , moving aside slightly , while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Jus ' nervous , eh ? " said Hagrid . 
" Bit , " said Harry . 
I'm not worried at all . 
He looked up at Hagrid - perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes , to deal with the creatures in it ? 
" I know it . 
I can feel it . 
Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns , he forced a smile in return , and moved forward to pat them with the others . 
By the evening before the second task . 
Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare . 
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside , tearing feverishly through page after page of spells , hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them . 
Harry s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word " water " on a page , but more often than not it was merely " Take two pints of water , half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves , and a newt ... " " I don't reckon it can be done , " said Rons voice flatly from the other side of the table . 
" There's nothing . 
Nothing . 
Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds , that Drought Charm , but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake . " 
" There must be something , " Hermione muttered , moving a candle closer to her . 
Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page . 
" They have , " said Ron . " Harry , just go down to the lake tomorrow , right , stick your head in , yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they ' ve nicked , and see if they chuck it out . 
Best you can do , mate . " 
" There's a way of doing it ! " 
Hermione said crossly . 
" There Just has to be ! " 
She seemed to be taking the library's lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult ; it had never failed her before . 
" I know what I should have done , " said Harry , resting , face - down , on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts . 
" I should ' ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius . " 
" Yeah , you could ' ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted ! " said Ron . " Or a frog , " yawned Harry . 
He was exhausted . 
" It takes years to become an Animagus , and then you have to register yourself and everything , " said Hermione vaguely , now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions . 
" Professor McGonagall told us , remember ... you ' ve got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office ... what animal you become , and your markings , so you can't abuse it ... " " Hermione , I was joking , " said Harry wearily . 
" I wouldn't mind , " said Fred Weasleys voice . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked up . 
Fred and George had just emerged from behind some bookshelves . 
" What ' re you two doing here ? " 
Ron asked . 
" Looking for you , " said George . 
" McGonagall wants you , Ron . 
And you , 
Hermione . " 
" Why ? " said Hermione , looking surprised . 
Ron and Hermione stared at Harry , who felt his stomach drop . 
Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off ? 
" We ' ll meet you back in the common room , " Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron - both of them looked very anxious . 
Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library . 
Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry , Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room , pulled a table into a corner , and continued to search . 
not one mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth - Century Charms , or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep , or Powers You Never Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now Youve Wised Up . 
The common room emptied slowly around Harry . 
People kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery , confident voices like Hagrid s , all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task . 
Harry couldn't answer them , he just nodded , feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat . 
By ten to midnight , he was alone in the room with Crookshanks . 
He had searched all the remaining books , and Ron and Hermione had not come back . 
It's over , he told himself . 
You can't do it . 
You ' ll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges .... 
He saw Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the crowd , saw Hagrid s crestfallen , disbelieving face . . . . 
Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap . 
Harry stood up very suddenly ; Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor , gave Harry a disgusted look , and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air , but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory . 
Cloak and go back to the library , he'd stay there all night if he had to . 
... " Lumos , " Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door . 
Wand tip alight , he crept along the bookshelves , pulling down more books - books of hexes and charms , books on merpeople and water monsters , books on famous witches and wizards , on magical inventions , on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival . 
He carried them over to a table , then set to work , searching them by the narrow beam of his wand , occasionally checking his watch . . . . 
One in the morning . . . 
two in the morning . . . the only way he could keep going was to tell himself , over and over again , next book . . . in the next one . . . the next one . . . 
The mermaid in the painting in the prefects ' bathroom was laughing . 
Harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock , while she held his Firebolt over his head . 
" Come and get it ! " 
" Give it to me ! " 
But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick , laughing at him . 
" That hurts - get off - ouch - " " Harry Potter must wake up , sir ! " " Stop poking me - " " Dobby must poke Harry Potter , sir , he must wake up ! " Harry opened his eyes . 
He was still in the library ; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he'd slept , and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There's a Wand , There's a Way . 
He sat up , straightening his glasses , blinking in the bright daylight . 
" Harry Potter needs to hurry ! " squeaked Dobby . 
" The second task starts in ten minutes , and Harry Potter - " " Ten minutes ? " 
Harry croaked . 
" Ten - ten minutes ? " 
He looked down at his watch . 
Dobby was right . 
It was twenty past nine . 
A large , dead weight seemed to fall through Harry's chest into his stomach . 
" Hurry , Harry Potter ! " squeaked Dobby , plucking at Harry's sleeve . 
" You is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions , sir ! " 
" It's too late , Dobby , " Harry said hopelessly . 
" I'm not doing the task , I don't know how - " " Harry Potter will do the task ! " squeaked the elf . 
" Dobby knew Harry had not found the right book , so Dobby did it for him ! " 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" But you don't know what the second task is - " " Dobby knows , sir ! 
Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy - " " Find my what ? " " - and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople ! " 
Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts . 
" What ? " 
Harry gasped . 
" ' But past an hour ' " " - ' the prospect's black , ' " Harry recited , staring , horror - struck , at the elf . 
" ' Too late , it's gone , it won't come back . ' 
Dobby - what ' ve I got to do ? " " You has to eat this , sir ! " s queaked the elf , and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy , grayish - green rat tails . 
" It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater , sir ! " " Dobby , " said Harry frantically , " listen - are you sure about this ? " 
" Dobby hears things , sir , he is a house - elf , he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors . 
Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom , talking about the next task . . . . 
Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy ! " 
Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak , stuffed it into his bag , grabbed the gillyweed , and put it into his pocket , then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels . 
" Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens , sir ! " Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor . 
" Dobby will be missed - good luck , Harry Potter , sir , good luck ! " " See you later , Dobby ! " Harry shouted , and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs , three at a time . 
The entrance hall contained a few last - minute stragglers , all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task . 
They stared as Harry flashed past , sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright , chilly grounds . 
As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons ' enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank , rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below . 
The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat - out around the other side of the lake toward the judges , who were sitting at another golddraped table at the water's edge . 
Cedric , Fleur , and Krum were beside the judges ' table , watching Harry sprint toward them . 
" I'm . 
" Where have you been ? " said a bossy , disapproving voice . 
" The task's about to start ! " 
Harry looked around . 
Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges ' table - Mr . Crouch had failed to turn up again . 
" Now , now , Percy ! " said Ludo Bagman , who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry . 
Dumbledore smiled at Harry , but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn't look at all pleased to see him . 
Harry bent over , hands on his knees , gasping for breath ; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs , but there was no time to get rid of it ; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions , spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet . 
Harry was on the very end of the line , next to Krum , who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready . 
" All right . 
Harry ? " Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away from Krum . 
" Know what you ' re going to do ? " " Yeah , " Harry panted , massaging his ribs . 
Bagman gave Harry's shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges ' table ; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup , said , " Sonorus ! " 
and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands . 
" Well , all our champions are ready for the second task , which will start on my whistle . 
They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them . 
On the count of three , then . 
One . . . 
two . . . 
three ! " 
The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold , still air ; the stands erupted with cheers and applause ; without looking to see what the other champions were doing , Harry pulled off his shoes and socks , pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket , stuffed it into his mouth , and waded out into the lake . 
It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire , not icy water . 
He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could ; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery , like octopus tentacles . 
He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid , walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power . 
The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples ; half immersed in the icy water , a cruel breeze lifting his hair , Harry started to shiver violently . 
He avoided looking at the stands ; the laughter was becoming louder , and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins . 
Then , quite suddenly , Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose . 
He tried to draw breath , but it made his head spin ; his lungs were empty , and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears , flapping in the cold air . . . . 
Without pausing to think , he did the only thing that made sense - he flung himself forward into the water . 
The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life . 
He twisted around and looked at his bare feet - they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too : It looked as though he had sprouted flippers . 
He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom . 
He could only see ten feet around him , so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness : forests of rippling , tangled black weed , wide plains of mud littered with dull , glimmering stones . 
He swam deeper and deeper , out toward the middle of the lake , his eyes wide , staring through the eerily gray - lit water around him to the shadow beyond , where the water became opaque . 
Small fish flickered past him like silver darts . 
Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him , but when he got nearer , he discovered it to be nothing but a large , blackened log , or a dense clump of weed . 
There was no sign of any of the other champions , merpeople , Ron - nor , thankfully , the giant squid . 
Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him , trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . 
Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow , a small , horned water demon , poking out of the weed , its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's leg , its pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand . 
By the time he had grasped it , two more grindylows had risen out of the weed , had seized handfuls of Harry's robes , and were attempting to drag him down . 
" Relashio ! " 
Harry shouted , except that no sound came out . 
... A large bubble issued from his mouth , and his wand , instead of sending sparks at the grindylows , pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water , for where it struck them , angry red patches appeared on their green skin . 
Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam , as fast as he could , occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random ; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again , and he kicked out , hard ; finally , he felt his foot connect with a horned skull , and looking back , saw the dazed grindylow floating away , cross - eyed , while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed . 
Harry slowed down a little , slipped his wand back inside his robes , and looked around , listening again . 
He turned full circle in the water , the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums . 
He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now , but nothing was moving but the rippling weed . 
" How are you getting on ? " 
Harry thought he was having a heart attack . 
He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him , gazing at him through her thick , pearly glasses . 
" Myrtle ! " 
Moaning Myrtle actually giggled . 
" You want to try over there ! " she said , pointing . 
" I won't come with you . 
... I don't like them much , they always chase me when I get too close . 
... " Harry gave her the thumbs - up to show his thanks and set off once more , careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there . 
Harry swam on past the rock , following the mersong . 
your time's half gone , so tarry not Lest what you seek stays here to rot . 
Here and there at the dark windows , Harry saw faces . . . 
faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects ' bathroom . . . . 
The merpeople had grayish skin and long , wild , dark green hair . 
Their eyes were yellow , as were their broken teeth , and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks . 
They leered at Harry as he swam past ; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better , their powerful , silver fish tails beating the water , spears clutched in their hands . 
Harry sped on , staring around , and soon the dwellings became more numerous ; there were gardens of weed around some of them , and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door . 
Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes . 
A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer - version of a village square . 
A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle , calling the champions toward them , and behind them rose a crude sort of statue ; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder . 
Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson . 
Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang . 
There was also a girl who looked no older than eight , whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour's sister . 
All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep . 
Harry sped toward the hostages , half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him , but they did nothing . 
The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick , slimy , and very strong . 
For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas - locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away , no use to him whatsoever . 
He looked around . 
He swam swiftly toward a seven - foot - tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear . 
The merman laughed and shook his head . 
" We do not help , " he said in a harsh , croaky voice . 
" Come ON ! " Harry said fiercely ( but only bubbles issued from his mouth ) , and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman , but the merman yanked it back , still shaking his head and laughing . 
Harry swirled around , staring about . 
anything . . . 
There were rocks littering the lake bottom . 
He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue . 
He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron , and after several minutes ' hard work , they broke apart . 
Ron floated , unconscious , a few inches above the lake bottom , drifting a little in the ebb of the water . 
Harry looked around . 
There was no sign of any of the other champions . 
What were they playing at ? 
Why didn't they hurry up ? 
He turned back to Hermione , raised the jagged rock , and began to hack at her bindings too At once , several pairs of strong gray hands seized him . 
" You take your own hostage , " one of them said to him . 
" Leave the others ... " " No way ! " said Harry furiously - but only two large bubbles came out . 
Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . 
" And I don't want them to die either ! " 
Cho's head was on Hermiones shoulder ; the small silver - haired girl was ghostly green and pale . 
Harry struggled to fight off the mermen , but they laughed harder than ever , holding him back . 
Harry looked wildly around . 
Where were the other champions ? 
Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others ? 
Would he be able to find them again ? 
He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped working . 
Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them . 
There was an enormous bubble around his head , which made his features look oddly wide and stretched . 
" Fleur and Krum ' re coming now ! " Feeling enormously relieved , Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free . 
He pulled her upward and out of sight . 
Harry looked around , waiting . 
Where were Fleur and Krum ? 
Time was getting short , and according to the song , the hostages would be lost after an hour . . . . 
Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them : a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark . 
... It was Krum . 
The shark - man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes ; the trouble was that Krum's new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin , and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn't careful , he was going to rip Hermione in half . 
Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone . 
Within seconds , he had done it ; he grabbed Hermione around the waist , and without a backward glance , began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface . 
Now what ? 
Harry thought desperately . 
He snatched up the stone , which Krum had dropped , but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl , shaking their heads at him . 
Harry pulled out his wand . 
" Get out of the way ! " 
Only bubbles flew out of his mouth , but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him , because they suddenly stopped laughing . 
Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry's wand , and they looked scared . 
There might be a lot more of them than there were of him , but Harry could tell , by the looks on their faces , that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did . 
Harry shouted ; a great stream of bubbles burst from him , but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message . 
" One . . 
Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue , and at last she was free . 
He seized the little girl around the waist , grabbed the neck of Rons robes , and kicked off from the bottom . 
Would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up ? 
Harry's legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming ; his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl ... 
He could feel pain on the sides of his neck again ... he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth .. . 
He kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet ... water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs ... he was starting to feel dizzy , but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him ... he had to get there ... he had to ... Harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest ; his very brain felt waterlogged , he couldn't breathe , he needed oxygen , he had to keep going , he could not stop And then he felt his head break the surface of the lake ; wonderful , cold , clear air was making his wet face sting ; he gulped it down , feeling as though he had never breathed properly before , and , panting , pulled Ron and the little girl up with him . 
All around him , wild , green - haired heads were emerging out of the water with him , but they were smiling at him . 
The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise ; shouting and screaming , they all seemed to be on their feet ; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead , but they were wrong . . . 
both of them had opened their eyes ; the girl looked scared and confused , but Ron merely expelled a great spout of water , blinked in the bright light , turned to Harry , and said , " Wet , this , isn't it ? " 
Then he spotted Fleur's sister . 
" What did you bring her for ? " 
" Harry , you prat , " said Ron , " you didn't take that song thing seriously , did you ? 
Dumbledore wouldn't have let any of us drown ! " " The song said - " " It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit ! " said Ron . " I hope you didn't waste time down there acting the hero ! " 
Harry felt both stupid and annoyed . 
They pulled Fleur's sister through the water , back toward the bank where the judges stood watching , twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor , singing their horrible screechy songs . 
Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione , Krum , Cedric , and Cho , all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets . 
Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as they swam nearer , but Percy , who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual , came splashing out to meet them . 
Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour , who was quite hysterical , fighting tooth and nail to return to the water . 
" Gabrielle ! 
Gabrielle ! 
Is she alive ? 
Is she ' urt ? " " She's fine ! " 
Harry tried to tell her , but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk , let alone shout . 
Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright ; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister . 
I thought .. . " 
" Come here , you , " said Madam Pomfrey . 
She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others , wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket , and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat . 
" Harry , well done ! " 
Hermione cried . 
" You did it , you found out how all by yourself ! " 
" Well - " said Harry . 
He was the only judge who had not left the table ; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry , Ron , and Fleur's sister had got back safely . 
" Yeah , that's right , " said Harry , raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him . 
" You haff a water beetle in your hair , Herm - own - ninny , " said Krum . 
Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself ; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake , but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said , " You ' re well outside the time limit , though , Harry . . . . 
Did it take you ages to find us ? " " No ... I found you okay .... " 
Harry's feeling of stupidity was growing . 
Now he was out of the water , it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledores safety precautions wouldn't have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn't turned up . 
Why hadn't he just grabbed Ron and gone ? 
... Dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge , deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson , a particularly wild and ferocious - looking female . 
He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water ; clearly , Dumbledore could speak Mermish . 
Finally he straightened up , turned to his fellow judges , and said , " A conference before we give the marks , I think . " 
Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy's clutches ; she led him over to Harry and the others , gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion , then went to fetch Fleur and her sister . 
Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn , but she didn't seem to care , nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them . 
" Look after Gabrielle , " she told her , and then she turned to Harry . 
" You saved ' er , " she said breathlessly . 
" Even though she was not your ' ostage . " 
Fleur bent down , kissed Harry twice on each cheek ( he felt his face burn and wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again ) , then said to Ron , " And you too - you ' elped - " " Yeah , " said Ron , looking extremely hopeful , " yeah , a bit - " Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him . 
Hermione looked simply furious , but just then , Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice boomed out beside them , making them all jump , and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet . 
" Ladies and gentlemen , we have reached our decision . 
Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake , and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions , as follows . . . . 
We award her twenty - five points . " 
Applause from the stands . 
" Cedric Diggory , who also used the Bubble - Head Charm , was first to return with his hostage , though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour . " 
Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd ; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look . 
Harrys heart sank . 
If Cedric had been outside the time limit , he most certainly had been . 
" Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration , which was nevertheless effective , and was second to return with his hostage . 
" Harry Potter used gillyweed to great effect , " Bagman continued . 
" He returned last , and well outside the time limit of an hour . 
However , the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr . Potter was first to reach the hostages , and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety , not merely his own . " 
Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half - exasperated , half - commiserating looks . 
" Most of the judges , " and here , Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look , " feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks . 
However . . . 
Mr . Potter's score is forty - five points . " 
Ron and Hermione , caught by surprise , stared at Harry , then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd . 
" There you go . 
Harry ! " Ron shouted over the noise . 
He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again , but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen . 
" The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty - fourth of June , " continued Bagman . 
Thank you all for your support of the champions . " 
It was over . 
Harry thought dazedly , as Madam Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over , he had got through ... he didn't have to worry about anything now until June the twenty - fourth . . 
.. Next time he was in Hogsmeade , Harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle , he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year . 
One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake , which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once . 
At first , he gave what seemed to be the truth ; it tallied with Hermione's story , anyway - Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office , first assuring them that they would be quite safe , and would awake when they were back above the water . 
" But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve , " he assured Padma Patil , who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors . 
" I could ' ve taken those mer - idiots any time I wanted . " 
" What were you going to do , snore at them ? " said Hermione waspishly . 
As they entered March the weather became drier , but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds . 
There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course . 
The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way ; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight , clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again . 
Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one . 
" He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade ? " said Ron incredulously . 
" It looks like it , doesn't it ? " said Hermione . 
Harry folded up the letter , thinking . 
If he was honest with himself , he really wanted to see Sirius again . 
He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon - double Potions - feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls . 
Pansys pug - like face peered excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry , Ron , and Hermione approached . 
" There they are , there they are ! " she giggled , and the knot of Slytherins broke apart . 
The moving picture on the front showed a curly - haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand . 
" You might find something to interest you in there , Granger ! " Pansy said loudly , and she threw the magazine at Hermione , who caught it , looking startled . 
At that moment , the dungeon door opened , and Snape beckoned them all inside . 
Hermione , Harry , and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual . 
Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard , Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk . 
At last , in the center pages , Hermione found what they were looking for . 
Harry and Ron leaned in closer . 
A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled : Harry Potter's Secret Heartache A boy like no other , perhaps - yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence , writes Rita Skeeter . 
Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents , fourteen - year - old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts , Muggle - born Hermione Granger . 
Miss Granger , a plain but ambitious girl , seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy . 
Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum , Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup , Miss Granger has been toying with both boys ' affections . 
Krum , who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger , has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays , and insists that he has " never felt this way about any other girl . " 
I think that's how she's doing it . " 
Love Potions are , of course , banned at Hogwarts , and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims . 
In the meantime , Harry Potters well - wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate . 
" I told you ! " Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article . 
" I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! 
" What a pile of old rubbish . " 
She looked over at the Slytherins , who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article . 
Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave , and she , Harry , and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit - Sharpening Potion . 
" There's something funny , though , " said Hermione ten minutes later , holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles . 
" How could Rita Skeeter have known . . . 
? " " Known what ? " said Ron quickly . 
" No , it's just . . . 
how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer ? " 
Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes . 
" What ? " said Ron , dropping his pestle with a loud clunk . 
" He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake , " Hermione muttered . 
Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear , and he said , if I wasn't doing anything over the summer , would I like to - " " And what did you say ? " said Ron , who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk , a good six inches from his bowl , because he was looking at 
Hermione . 
" And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else , " Hermione went on , going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her , " but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him ? 
Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak ; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task . 
" Well , I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to - " " Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is . 
Ten points from Gryffindor . " Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking . 
The whole class was now looking around at them ; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry . 
" Ah . . . 
Snape added , snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly . 
The dungeon rang with the Slytherins ' laughter , and an unpleasant smile curled Snape's thin mouth . 
To Harry's fury , he began to read the article aloud . 
" ' Harry Potter's Secret Heartache . . . 
Harry could feel his face burning . 
Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh . 
The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape . 
Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now . 
Harry Potter's well - wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate . ' 
How very touching , " sneered Snape , rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins . 
" Well , I think I had better separate the three of you , so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives . 
Weasley , you stay here . 
Miss Granger , over there , beside Miss Parkinson . 
Potter - that table in front of my desk . 
Now . " Furious , Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table . 
Snape followed , sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron . 
Determined not to look at Snape , Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles , imagining each one to have Snape's face . 
Potter , " said Snape quietly , once the rest of the class had settled down again . 
Harry didn't answer . 
He knew Snape was trying to provoke him ; he had done this before . 
No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class . 
" You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you , " Snape went on , so quietly that no one else could hear him ( Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles , even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder ) , " but I don't care how many times your picture appears in the papers . 
Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots . 
His hands were shaking slightly out of anger , but he kept his eyes down , as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him . 
" Boomslang skin . 
Both come from my private stores , and I know who stole them . " 
Harry stared back at Snape , determined not to blink or to look guilty . 
Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year - they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion - and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time , he had never been able to prove it . 
Dobby , of course , had stolen the gillyweed . 
" I don't know what you ' re talking about , " Harry lied coldly . 
" You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into ! " Snape hissed . 
" I know it . 
Potter ! 
" Right , " said Harry coolly , turning back to his ginger roots . 
" I ' ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there . " 
Snape's eyes flashed . 
He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes . 
For one wild moment . 
Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion . 
Harry stared at it . 
" Do you know what this is . 
Potter ? " Snape said , his eyes glittering dangerously again . 
" No , " said Harry , with complete honesty this time . 
" Now , the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines . 
And then . 
Potter . . . 
Harry said nothing . 
He turned back to his ginger roots once more , picked up his knife , and started slicing them again . 
He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it ... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble - Hermione and Dobby for a start - there were all the other things he was concealing . . . 
like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . 
He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too , and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask . 
There was a knock on the dungeon door . 
" Enter , " said Snape in his usual voice . 
The class looked around as the door opened . 
Professor Karkaroff came in . 
Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape's desk . 
He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated . 
" We need to talk , " said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape . 
He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips ; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist . 
Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots , listening hard . 
" I ' ll talk to you after my lesson , Karkaroff , " Snape muttered , but Karkaroff interrupted him . 
" I want to talk now , while you can't slip off , Severus . 
Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough armadillo bile , Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them . 
Karkaroff looked extremely worried , and Snape looked angry . 
Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period . 
He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class . 
Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say , Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell , which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door . 
" What's so urgent ? " he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff . 
" This , " said Karkaroff , and Harry , peering around the edge of his cauldron , saw Karkaroff pull up the left - hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm . 
" Well ? " said Karkaroff , still making every effort not to move his lips . 
" Do you see ? 
It's never been this clear , never since - " " Put it away ! " 
snarled Snape , his black eyes sweeping the classroom . 
" But you must have noticed - " Karkaroff began in an agitated voice . 
" We can talk later , Karkaroff ! " spat Snape . 
" Potter ! 
What are you doing ? " " Clearing up my armadillo bile , Professor , " said Harry innocently , straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding . 
Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon . 
He looked both worried and angry . 
Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape , Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed . 
They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds . 
The weather was milder than it had been all year , and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade , all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders . 
The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry's bag ; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs , a loaf of bread , and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table . 
They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby , where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find , including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars , and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly . 
Then , at half past one , they made their way up the High Street , past Dervish and Banges , and out toward the edge of the village . 
Harry had never been in this direction before . 
The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade . 
The cottages were fewer here , and their gardens larger ; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay . 
Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane . 
" Hello , Sirius , " said Harry when they had reached him . 
The black dog sniffed Harry's bag eagerly , wagged its tail once , then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed . 
Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain , where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks . 
It was easy for him , with his four paws , but Harry , Ron , and Hermione were soon out of breath . 
They followed Sirius higher , up onto the mountain itself . 
For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep , winding , and stony path , following Sirius's wagging tail , sweating in the sun , the shoulder straps of Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders . 
Then , at last , Sirius slipped out of sight , and when they reached the place where he had vanished , they saw a narrow fissure in the rock . 
They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool , dimly lit cave . 
Tethered at the end of it , one end of his rope around a large rock , was Buckbeak the hippogriff . 
All three of them bowed low to him , and after regarding them imperiously for a moment , Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck . 
Harry , however , was looking at the black dog , which had just turned into his godfather . 
Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes ; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban . 
His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire , and it was untidy and matted once more . 
He looked very thin . 
" Chicken ! " he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor . 
Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread . 
" Thanks , " said Sirius , opening it , grabbing a drumstick , sitting down on the cave floor , and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth . 
Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade ; I'd draw attention to myself . " 
He grinned up at Harry , but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly . 
" What ' re you doing here , Sirius ? " he said . 
He was still grinning , but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face , said more seriously , " I want to be on the spot . 
well , let's just say things are getting fishier . 
I ' ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out , and by the looks of things , I'm not the only one who's getting worried . " 
He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor , and Ron picked them up and unfolded them . 
Harry , however , continued to stare at Sirius . 
" What if they catch you ? 
What if you ' re seen ? " 
" You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an Animagus , " said Sirius , shrugging , and continuing to devour the chicken leg . 
Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets . 
There were two : The first bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch , the second , Ministry Witch Still Missing - Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved . 
Harry scanned the story about Crouch . 
" They're making it sound like he's dying , " said Harry slowly . 
" But he can't be that ill if he managed to get up here . . . 
. " " My brothers Crouch's personal assistant , " Ron informed Sirius . 
" The night my name came out of the goblet . 
She was stroking Buckbeak , who was crunching up Sirius's chicken bones . 
" I bet he wishes he hadn't done it now - bet he feels the difference now she's not there to look after him . " 
" Hermione's obsessed with house - elfs , " Ron muttered to Sirius , casting Hermione a dark look . 
Sirius , however , looked interested . 
" Yeah , at the Quidditch World Cup , " said Harry , and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark's appearance , and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand , and Mr . Crouch's fury . 
When Harry had finished , Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave . 
" You first saw the elfin the Top Box . 
She was saving Crouch a seat , right ? " " Right , " said Harry , Ron , and Hermione together . 
" But Crouch didn't turn up for the match ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" I think he said he'd been too busy . " 
Sirius paced all around the cave in silence . 
Then he said , " Harry , did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box ? " " Erm . . 
Harry thought hard . 
" No , " he said finally . 
" I didn't need to use it before we got in the forest . 
And then I put my hand in my pocket , and all that was in there were my Omnioculars . " 
He stared at Sirius . 
" Winky didn't steal that wand ! " Hermione insisted . 
" Who else was sitting behind you ? " " Loads of people , " said Harry . 
" Some Bulgarian ministers .. . 
Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ... " " The Malfoys ! " said Ron suddenly , so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave , and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously . 
" No one , " said Harry . 
" Yes , there was , there was Ludo Bagman , " Hermione reminded him . 
" Oh yeah . . 
" What's he like ? " 
" He's okay , " said Harry . 
" I wonder why he'd do that ? " 
" Says he's taken a liking to me , " said Harry . 
" Hmm , " said Sirius , looking thoughtful . 
" We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared , " Hermione told Sirius . 
" Remember ? " 
she said to Harry and Ron . 
" Yeah , but he didn't stay in the forest , did he ? " said Ron . " The moment we told him about the riot , he went off to the campsite . " 
" How d ' you know ? " Hermione shot back . 
" Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark ? " " It's more likely he did it than Winky , " said Hermione stubbornly . 
" Told you , " said Ron , looking meaningfully at Sirius , " told you she's obsessed with house - " But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron . 
" When the Dark Mark had been conjured , and the elf had been discovered holding Harry's wand , what did Crouch do ? " " Went to look in the bushes , " said Harry , " but there wasn't anyone else there . " 
" Of course , " Sirius muttered , pacing up and down , " of course , he'd want to pin it on anyone but his own elf ... and then he sacked her ? " " Yes , " said Hermione in a heated voice , " he sacked her , just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled - " " Hermione , will you give it a rest with the elf ! " said Ron . Sirius shook his head and said , " She's got the measure of Crouch better than you have , Ron . 
If you want to know what a mans like , take a good look at how he treats his inferiors , not his equals . " 
He ran a hand over his unshaven face , evidently thinking hard . 
" All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house - elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup , but doesn't bother to turn up and watch . 
He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament , and then stops coming to that too . . . . 
It's not like Crouch . 
" D ' you know Crouch , then ? " said Harry . 
Sirius's face darkened . 
He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him , the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer . 
" Oh I know Crouch all right , " he said quietly . 
" He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban - without a trial . " 
" What ? " said Ron and Hermione together . 
" You ' re kidding ! " said Harry . 
" Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , didn't you know ? " Harry , Ron , and Hermione shook their heads . 
" He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic , " said Sirius . 
" He's a great wizard , Barty Crouch , powerfully magical - and power - hungry . 
" No , Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side . 
well , you wouldn't understand . . . 
you ' re too young . 
... " " That's what my dad said at the World Cup , " said Ron , with a trace of irritation in his voice . 
A grin flashed across Sirius's thin face . 
" All right , I ' ll try you . . . 
He walked once up the cave , back again , and then said , " Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now . 
You don't know who his supporters are , you don't know who's working for him and who isn't ; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves . 
You ' re scared for yourself , and your family , and your friends . 
Every week , news comes of more deaths , more disappearances , more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic's in disarray , they don't know what to do , they ' re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles , but meanwhile , Muggles are dying too . 
panic . . . 
that's how it used to be . 
" Well , times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others . 
He rose quickly through the Ministry , and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemorts supporters . 
And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial . 
Crouch fought violence with violence , and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects . 
I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side . 
He had his supporters , mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way , and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic . 
When Voldemort disappeared , it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job . 
But then something rather unfortunate happened . 
... " Sirius smiled grimly . 
" Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban . 
Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power . " 
" Crouch's son was caught ? " gasped Hermione . 
" Yep , " said Sirius , throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak , flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread , and tearing it in half . 
gotten to know his own son . " 
He began to wolf down large pieces of bread . 
" Was his son a Death Eater ? " said Harry . 
" No idea , " said Sirius , still stuffing down bread . 
" I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in . 
The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters - but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time , just like the house - elf . " 
" Did Crouch try and get his son off ? " Hermione whispered . 
Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark . 
" Crouch let his son off ? 
I thought you had the measure of him , Hermione ! 
Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go ; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic . 
You saw him dismiss a devoted houseelf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again - doesn't that tell you what he's like ? 
Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial , and by all accounts , it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . 
then he sent him straight to Azkaban . " " He gave his own son to the dementors ? " 
asked Harry quietly . 
" That's right , " said Sirius , and he didn't look remotely amused now . 
" I saw the dementors bringing him in , watched them through the bars in my cell door . 
They took him into a cell near mine . 
. they all went quiet in the end . . . 
... " For a moment , the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever , as though shutters had closed behind them . 
" So he's still in Azkaban ? " 
Harry said . 
" No , " said Sirius dully . 
" No , he's not in there anymore . 
" He died ? " " He wasn't the only one , " said Sirius bitterly . 
They lose the will to live . 
Crouch being an important Ministry member , he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit . 
That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch , half carrying his wife past my cell . 
She died herself , apparently , shortly afterward . 
Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it . 
" So old Crouch lost it all , just when he thought he had it made , " he continued , wiping his mouth with the back of his hand . 
" One moment , a hero , poised to become Minister of Magic ... next , his son dead , his wife dead , the family name dishonored , and , so I ' ve heard since I escaped , a big drop in popularity . 
So Cornelius Fudge got the top job , and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation . " 
There was a long silence . 
Harry was thinking of the way Crouch's eyes had bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient house - elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup . 
It had brought back memories of his son , and the old scandal , and his fall from grace at the Ministry . 
" Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards , " Harry told Sirius . 
" Yeah , I ' ve heard it's become a bit of a mania with him , " said Sirius , nodding . 
" And he sneaked up here to search Snape's office ! " s aid Ron triumphantly , looking at Hermione . 
" Yeah , it does ! " said Ron excitedly , but Sirius shook his head . 
" Listen , if Crouch wants to investigate Snape , why hasn't he been coming to judge the tournament ? 
It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him . " 
Harry said loudly , and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen . 
" I think they ' ve both got a point , " said Sirius , looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione . 
Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts , he was famous for it at school . 
Slimy , oily , greasy - haired kid , he was , " Sirius added , and Harry and Ron grinned at each other . 
" Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year , and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters . " 
" Rosier and Wilkes - they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell . 
The Lestranges - they ' re a married couple - they ' re in Azkaban . 
Avery - from what I ' ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under the Imperius Curse - he's still at large . 
But as far as I know , Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater - not that that means much . 
And Snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble . " 
" Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well , but he wants to keep that quiet , " said Ron . " Yeah , you should ' ve seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday ! " said Harry quickly . 
" Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape , he says Snape's been avoiding him . 
Karkaroff looked really worried . 
He showed Snape something on his arm , but I couldn't see what it was . " 
He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair , then shrugged again . 
" There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape , and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't , but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort . " 
I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all , and after the things he's seen , it's not surprising . 
I ' ll say this for Moody , though , he never killed if he could help it . 
He was tough , but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters . 
Crouch , though . . . 
he's a different matter ... is he really ill ? 
If he is , why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office ? 
And if he's not . . . 
what's he up to ? 
What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box ? What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament ? " 
Sirius lapsed into silence , still staring at the cave wall . 
Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor , looking for bones he might have overlooked . 
Finally , Sirius looked up at Ron . " You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant ? 
Percy loves Crouch . " 
" And you might try and find out whether they ' ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you ' re at it , " said Sirius , gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet . 
" Bagman told me they hadn't , " said Harry . 
" Yes , he's quoted in the article in there , " said Sirius , nodding at the paper . 
" Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is . 
It used to get her into a lot of trouble ; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut . 
I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . 
maybe that's why Bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long . 
" What's the time ? " 
" It's half past three , " said Hermione . 
" Now listen . . 
He looked particularly hard at Harry . 
" I don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me , all right ? 
Just send notes to me here . 
I still want to hear about anything odd . 
But you ' re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission ; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you . " 
" No one's tried to attack me so far , except a dragon and a couple of grindylows , " Harry said , but Sirius scowled at him . 
He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good - bye . 
" I ' ll walk to the edge of the village with you , " said Sirius , " see if I can scrounge another paper . " 
He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave , and they walked back down the mountainside with him , across the boulder - strewn ground , and back to the stile . 
Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head , before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts . 
" Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch ? " Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle . 
" Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors , " said Hermione severely . 
Percy's really ambitious , you know . 
... " They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall , where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall . 
" Poor old Snuffles , " said Ron , breathing deeply . 
" He must really like you . 
Harry . . . . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy , asking , as Sirius had suggested , whether he had seen Mr . Crouch lately . 
When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window , they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks . 
" Harry Potter is too good to Dobby ! " he squeaked , wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes . 
" You saved my life with that gillyweed , Dobby , you really did , " said Harry . 
" We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles , " Harry muttered . 
" Good idea , " said Ron . " Give Pig something to do . 
You couldn't give us a bit of extra food , could you ? " he said to the surrounding elves , and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more . 
" Dobby , where's Winky ? " said Hermione , who was looking around . 
" Winky is over there by the fire , miss , " said Dobby quietly , his ears drooping slightly . 
" Oh dear , " said Hermione as she spotted Winky . 
Harry looked over at the fireplace too . 
Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time , but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke - blackened brick behind her . 
" Winky is getting through six bottles a day now , " Dobby whispered to Harry . 
" Well , it's not strong , that stuff , " Harry said . 
But Dobby shook his head . 
Winky hiccuped again . 
" Winky is pining , Harry Potter , " Dobby whispered sadly . 
" Winky wants to go home . 
Winky still thinks Mr . Crouch is her master , sir , and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now . " 
Because he's stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament . " 
Winky's eyes flickered . 
Her enormous pupils focused on Harry . 
The Daily Prophet's saying he's ill . " 
Winky swayed some more , staring blurrily at Harry . 
" But we ' re not sure if that's true , " said Hermione quickly . 
. " " Other people manage to do their own housework , you know , Winky , " Hermione said severely . 
" Winky - hic - is not only - hic - doing housework for Mr . Crouch ! " 
" Master is - hic - trusting Winky with - hic - the most important - hic - the most secret ... " " What ? " said Harry . 
" You is - hic - nosing , you is . " " Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter ! " said Dobby angrily . 
The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone - flagged floor . 
Half a dozen house - elves came hurrying forward , looking disgusted . 
One of them picked up the bottle ; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly , hiding her from view . 
" Why don't you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up ? " " Begging your pardon , miss , " said the house - elf , bowing deeply again , " but houseelves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served . " 
" Oh for heavens sake ! " Hermione cried . 
" Listen to me , all of you ! 
You ' ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy ! 
You ' ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes , you don't have to do everything you ' re told - look at Dobby ! " " Miss will please keep Dobby out of this , " Dobby mumbled , looking scared . 
The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house - elves around the kitchen . 
" We has your extra food ! " squeaked an elf at Harry's elbow , and he shoved a large ham , a dozen cakes , and some fruit into Harry's arms . 
" Good - bye ! " 
The house - elves crowded around Harry , Ron , and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen , many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs . 
" Thank you for the socks , Harry Potter ! " Dobby called miserably from the hearth , where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky . 
" You couldn't keep your mouth shut , could you , Hermione ? " said Ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them . 
Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius's food up to the Owlery that evening on his own . 
Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself , so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well . 
Harry leaned on the windowsill , looking out at the grounds , at the dark , rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest , and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship . 
An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrids chimney ; it soared toward the castle , around the Owlery , and out of sight . 
Harry wondered what he was doing ; it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch . 
As he watched , Madame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid . 
She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation . 
Hagrid leaned upon his spade , but did not seem keen to prolong their talk , because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward . 
Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione snarling at each other , Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake , swooshing past him into the night . 
By breakfast the next day Ron's and Hermione's bad moods had burnt out , and to Harrys relief , Ron's dark predictions that the house - elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione had insulted them proved false ; the bacon , eggs , and kippers were quite as good as usual . 
When the post owls arrived , Hermione looked up eagerly ; she seemed to be expecting something . 
" Percy won't ' ve had time to answer yet , " said Ron . " We only sent Hedwig yesterday . " 
" No , it's not that , " said Hermione . 
" I ' ve taken out a subscription to the Daily Prophet . 
I'm getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins . " 
" Good thinking ! " said Harry , also looking up at the owls . 
" Hey , Hermione , I think you ' re in luck - " A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione . 
" It's - " But to her bewilderment , the gray owl landed in front of her plate , closely followed by four barn owls , a brown owl , and a tawny . 
" What on earth - ? " Hermione said , taking the letter from the gray owl , opening it , and starting to read . 
" Oh really ! " she sputtered , going rather red . 
" What's up ? " said Ron . " It ,'s - oh how ridiculous - " She thrust the letter at Harry , who saw that it was not handwritten , but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily Prophet . 
HARRY POTTER DESERVES BETTER . 
" They're all like it ! " said Hermione desperately , opening one letter after another . 
" ' Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you . . . 
. ' Ouch ! " 
She had opened the last envelope , and yellowish - green liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands , which began to erupt in large yellow boils . 
" Undiluted bubotuber pus ! " said Ron , picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it . 
" Ow ! " said Hermione , tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin , but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick , knobbly gloves . 
" You'd better get up to the hospital wing , " said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight . 
" We ' ll tell Professor Sprout where you ' ve gone . . . 
. " " I warned her ! " said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall , cradling her hands . 
" I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! 
As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class , they saw Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle . 
Why was she so upset at breakfast ? " 
Harry ignored her ; he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused . 
Harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates - surely not another skrewt hatching ? 
Their front paws were curiously flat , like spades , and they were blinking up at the class , looking politely puzzled at all the attention . 
" These ' re nifflers , " said Hagrid , when the class had gathered around . 
One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson's watch off her wrist . 
She shrieked and jumped backward . 
" Useful little treasure detectors , " said Hagrid happily . 
" Thought we'd have some fun with ' em today . 
See over there ? " 
He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window . 
" I ' ve buried some gold coins . 
Harry took off his watch , which he was only wearing out of habit , as it didn't work anymore , and stuffed it into his pocket . 
Then he picked up a niffler . 
Where's Hermione ? " 
" She had to go to the hospital wing , " said Ron . " We ' ll explain later , " Harry muttered ; Pansy Parkinson was listening . 
The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water , each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands . 
Ron's was particularly efficient ; it had soon filled his lap with coins . 
" Can you buy these as pets , Hagrid ? " he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil , splattering his robes . 
" Yer mum wouldn ' be happy , Ron , " said Hagrid , grinning . 
I reckon they ' ve nearly got the lot , now , " he added , pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive . 
Hermione was walking toward them across the lawn . 
Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable . 
Pansy Parkinson was watching her beadily . 
" Well , let's check how yeh ' ve done ! " said Hagrid . 
" It's leprechaun gold . 
It turned out that Ron's niffler had been most successful , so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize . 
The bell rang across the grounds for lunch ; the rest of the class set off back to the castle , but Harry , Ron , and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes . 
Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them out other carriage window . 
Hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning , and the envelope full of bubotuber pus . 
' Yeh ' re a monster an yeh should be put down . ' ' Yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lake . ' " 
" No ! " said Hermione , looking shocked . 
" They're good , nifflers , aren't they , Ron ? " Ron , however , was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him . 
" What's the matter ? " said Harry . 
" Wrong flavor ? " " No , " said Ron shortly . 
" Why didn't you tell me about the gold ? " " What gold ? " said Harry . 
" The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup , " said Ron . " The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars . 
Why didn't you tell me it disappeared ? " 
Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about . 
" Oh . . 
. " he said , the memory coming back to him at last . 
" I dunno ... I never noticed it had gone . 
I was more worried about my wand , wasn't I ? " They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for lunch . 
" Must be nice , " Ron said abruptly , when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings . 
" Listen , I had other stuff on my mind that night ! " s aid Harry impatiently . 
" I thought I was paying you back . 
You shouldn't ' ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas . " 
" Forget it , all right ? " said Harry . 
Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork , glaring at it . 
Then he said , " I 
hate being poor . " 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other . 
Neither of them really knew what to say . 
" It's rubbish , " said Ron , still glaring down at his potato . 
" I don't blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money . 
Wish I could . 
Wish I had a niffler . " 
Then , when Ron continued to look gloomy , she said , " Come on , Ron , it could be worse . 
At least your fingers aren't full of pus . " 
Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork , her fingers were so stiff and swollen . 
" I ' ll get her back for this if it's the last thing I do ! " Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week , and although she followed Hagrid's advice and stopped opening it , several of her ill - wishers sent Howlers , which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear . 
Even those people who didn't read Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry - Krum - Hermione triangle now . 
... People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time " I want to know how she's listening into private conversations when she's supposed to be banned from the grounds ! " said Hermione angrily . 
Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something . 
The rest of the class was very eager to leave ; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex - deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries . 
Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears , he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class . 
" Well , Rita's definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak ! " Hermione panted five minutes later , catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling Harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her . 
" Moody says he didn't see her anywhere near the judges ' table at the second task , or anywhere near the lake ! " " Hermione , is there any point in telling you to drop this ? " said Ron . " No ! " said Hermione stubbornly . 
" I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor ! 
" Bugged ? " said Ron blankly . 
" What . . . 
Ron was fascinated , but Hermione interrupted them . 
" All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity , computers , and radar , and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts , there's too much magic in the air . 
No , Rita's using magic to eavesdrop , she must be . 
Ron asked her . 
" Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well ? " " I'm not asking you to help ! " Hermione snapped . 
" I ' ll do it on my own ! " 
She marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance . 
Harry was quite sure she was going to the library . 
" What's the betting she comes back with a box of / Hate Rita Skeeter badges ? " said Ron . Hermione , however , did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter , for which they were both grateful , because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays . 
He was working flat - out just to get through all their homework , though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius ; after last summer , Harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry . 
He enclosed notes to Sirius , telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened , and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy . 
Hedwig didn't return until the end of the Easter holidays . 
Percy's letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs . Weasley had sent . 
Both Harrys and Ron's were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee . 
Hermiones , however , was smaller than a chicken egg . 
Her face fell when she saw it . 
" Yeah , " said Ron , whose mouth was full of toffee . 
" Gets it for the recipes . " 
Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg . 
" Don't you want to see what Percy's written ? " 
Harry asked her hastily . 
Percys letter was short and irritated . 
As I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet , Mr . Crouch is taking a well - deserved break . 
No , I haven't actually seen him , but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior's handwriting . 
I have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors . 
The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season . 
This year , however , it was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to prepare , but he still didn't know what he would have to do . 
Finally , in the last week of May , Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration . 
" You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o ' clock . 
Potter , " she told him . 
" Mr . 
Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task . " 
Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs . 
As he crossed the entrance hall , Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room . 
" What d ' you reckon it's going to be ? " he asked Harry as they went together down the stone steps , out into the cloudy night . 
" Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels ; she reckons we ' ve got to find treasure . " 
They walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium , turned through a gap in the stands , and walked out onto the field . 
" What ' ve they done to it ? " 
The Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat . 
" They're hedges ! " said Harry , bending to examine the nearest one . 
Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur . 
Harry and Cedric made their way toward them , climbing over the hedges . 
Fleur beamed at Harry as he came nearer . 
" Well , what d ' you think ? " said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric climbed over the last hedge . 
Now , I imagine you can guess what we ' re making here ? " 
No one spoke for a moment . 
Then 
" Maze , " grunted Krum . 
" That's right ! " said Bagman . 
" A maze . 
The third task's really very straightforward . 
The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze . 
" There will be obstacles , " said Bagman happily , bouncing on the balls of his feet . 
" Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . 
Now , the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze . " 
Bagman grinned at Harry and Cedric . 
" Then Mr . Krum will enter . . . 
then Miss Delacour . 
But you ' ll all be in with a fighting chance , depending how well you get past the obstacles . 
Should be fun , eh ? " Harry , who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this , thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all . 
However , he nodded politely like the other champions . 
" Very well . . . 
if you haven't got any questions , we ' ll go back up to the castle , shall we , it's a bit chilly . 
... " Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze . 
Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help him again , but just then , Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder . 
" Vill you valk vith me ? " " Okay , " said Harry curiously . 
Bagman looked slightly perturbed . 
" I ' ll wait for you . 
Harry , shall I ? " " No , it's okay , Mr . Bagman , " said Harry , suppressing a smile , " I think I can find the castle on my own , thanks . " 
Harry and Krum left the stadium together , but Krum did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship . 
Instead , he walked toward the forest . 
" Don't vont to be overheard , " said Krum shortly . 
When at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the 
Beauxbatons horses ' paddock , Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face Harry . 
Harry , who from Krum's secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this , stared up at Krum in amazement . 
" Nothing , " he said . 
But Krum glowered at him , and Harry , somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was , elaborated . 
" We're friends . 
" Hermy - own - ninny talks about you very often , " said Krum , looking suspiciously at Harry . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , " because were friends . " 
He couldn't quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum , the famous International Quidditch player . 
It was as though the eighteen - year - old Krum thought he . 
you haff not ... " " No , " said Harry very firmly . 
Krum looked slightly happier . 
He stared at Harry for a few seconds , then said , " You fly very veil . 
I vos votching at the first task . " 
" I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup . 
The Wronski Feint , you really - " But something moved behind Krum in the trees , and Harry , who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest , instinctively grabbed Krum's arm and pulled him around . 
" Vot is it ? " 
Harry shook his head , staring at the place where he'd seen movement . 
He slipped his hand inside his robes , reaching for his wand . 
Suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak . 
For a moment , Harry didn't recognize him . . . 
then he realized it was Mr . Crouch . 
He looked as though he had been traveling for days . 
The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody , his face scratched ; he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion . 
His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim . 
His strange appearance , however , was nothing to the way he was behaving . 
Muttering and gesticulating , Mr . Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see . 
He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys . 
That man too had been conversing wildly with thin air ; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley's hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him ; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants . 
" Vosn't he a judge ? " said Krum , staring at Mr . Crouch . 
Harry nodded , hesitated for a moment , then walked slowly toward Mr . Crouch , who did not look at him , but continued to talk to a nearby tree . 
. " " Mr . 
Crouch ? " said Harry cautiously . 
" ... and then send another owl to Madame Maxime , because she might want to up the number of students she's bringing , now Karkaroff's made it a round dozen ... do that , Weatherby , will you ? 
Will you ? 
Will ... " Mr . Crouch's eyes were bulging . 
He stood staring at the tree , muttering soundlessly at it . 
Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees . 
" Mr . 
Crouch ? " 
Harry said loudly . 
" Are you all right ? " 
Crouch's eyes were rolling in his head . 
Harry looked around at Krum , who had followed him into the trees , and was looking down at Crouch in alarm . 
" Vot is wrong with him ? " 
" No idea , " Harry muttered . 
gasped Mr . Crouch . 
He reached out and seized a handful of Harrys robes , dragging him closer , though his eyes were staring over Harry's head . 
" I need ... see ... Dumbledore . 
... " " Okay , " said Harry , " if you get up , Mr . Crouch , we can go up to the - " " I ' ve done . . . 
stupid . . . 
thing . . 
Mr . Crouch breathed . 
He looked utterly mad . 
His eyes were rolling and bulging , and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin . 
Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort . 
Dumbledore . . 
. " " Get up , Mr . Crouch , " said Harry loudly and clearly . 
" Get up , I ' ll take you to Dumbledore ! " Mr , Crouch's eyes rolled forward onto Harry . 
" Who ... you ? " he whispered . 
" I'm a student at the school , " said Harry , looking around at Krum for some help , but Krum was hanging back , looking extremely nervous . 
" You ' re not ... his ? " whispered Crouch , his mouth sagging . 
" No , " said Harry , without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about . 
" Dumbledore's ? " " That's right , " said Harry . 
Crouch was pulling him closer ; Harry tried to loosen Crouch's grip on his robes , but it was too powerful . 
" Warn ... Dumbledore ... " " I ' ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me , " said Harry . 
" Just let go , Mr . Crouch , and I ' ll get him .. . 
. " " Thank you , Weatherby , and when you have done that , I would like a cup of tea . 
My wife and son will be arriving shortly , we are attending a concert tonight with Mr . and Mrs . Fudge . " 
Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again , and seemed completely unaware that Harry was there , which surprised Harry so much he didn't notice that Crouch had released him . 
" Yes , my son has recently gained twelve O . W . L . S , most satisfactory , yes , thank you , yes , very proud indeed . 
Now , if you could bring me that memo from the Andorran Minister of Magic , I think I will have time to draft a response . 
... " " You stay here with him ! " 
Harry said to Krum . 
" Just stay with him , " said Harry , starting to get up , but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr . Crouch , who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground . 
leave .. . 
me ! " he whispered , his eyes bulging again . 
" I ... escaped .. . 
must tell ... see Dumbledore . . . 
my fault ... all my fault . . . 
Bertha . . . 
dead ... all my fault . 
.. my son ... my fault ... tell Dumbledore ... Harry Potter ... the Dark Lord . . . 
Harry Potter ... " " I ' ll get Dumbledore if you let me go , Mr . Crouch ! " said Harry . 
He looked furiously around at Krum . " Help me , will you ? " 
Looking extremely apprehensive , Krum moved forward and squatted down next to Mr . Crouch . 
" Just keep him here , " said Harry , pulling himself free of Mr . Crouch . 
" I ' ll be back with Dumbledore . " " Hurry , von't you ? " Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds . 
Harry tore up the stone steps , through the oak front doors , and off up the marble staircase , toward the second floor . 
This was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore's office - or at least , it had been two years ago . 
Harry shouted at it . 
But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it ; he knew it was no good . 
He looked up and down the dark corridor . 
Perhaps Dumbledore was in the staffroom ? 
He started running as fast as he could toward the staircase " POTTER ! " 
Harry skidded to a halt and looked around . 
Snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle . 
The wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him . 
" What are you doing here , Potter ? " " I need to see Professor Dumbledore ! " said Harry , running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead . 
" It's Mr . Crouch . . . 
he's just turned up ... he's in the forest ... he's asking - " " What is this rubbish ? " said Snape , his black eyes glittering . 
" What are you talking about ? " " Mr . 
Crouch ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" From the Ministry ! 
He's ill or something - he's in the forest , he wants to see Dumbledore ! Just give me the password up to - " " The headmaster is busy . 
" I ' ve got to tell Dumbledore ! " Harry yelled . 
" Didn't you hear me . 
Potter ? " 
Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself , denying Harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky . 
" Look , " said Harry angrily , " Crouch isn't right - he's - he's out of his mind - he says he wants to warn - " The stone wall behind Snape slid open . 
Dumbledore was standing there , wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression . 
" Is there a problem ? " he said , looking between Harry and Snape . 
" Professor ! " 
Harry said , sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak , " Mr . 
Crouch is here - he's down in the forest , he wants to speak to you ! " Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions , but to his relief , Dumbledore did nothing of the sort . 
" Lead the way , " he said promptly , and he swept off along the corridor behind Harry , leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly . 
" What did Mr . Crouch say . 
Harry ? " said Dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase . 
" Said he wants to warn you . . . said he's done something terrible ... he mentioned his son . . . 
and Bertha Jorkins .. . 
and - and Voldemort . . . 
something about Voldemort getting stronger . 
... " " Indeed , " said Dumbledore , and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitch - darkness . 
" He doesn't seem to know where he is . 
He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley's there , and then he changes , and says he needs to see you . 
... I left him with Viktor Krum . " " You did ? " said Dumbledore sharply , and he began to take longer strides still , so that Harry was running to keep up . 
" Do you know if anybody else saw Mr . Crouch ? " 
" No , " said Harry . 
" Krum and I were talking , Mr . Bagman had just finished telling us about the third task , we stayed behind , and then we saw Mr . Crouch coming out of the forest - " " Where are they ? " said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness . 
" Over here , " said Harry , moving in front of Dumbledore , leading the way through the trees . 
He couldn't hear Crouch's voice anymore , but he knew where he was going ; it hadn't been much past the Beauxbatons carriage . . . 
" Viktor ? " Harry shouted . 
No one answered . 
" They were here , " Harry said to Dumbledore . 
" They were definitely somewhere around here . 
Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk , illuminating the ground . 
And then it fell upon a pair of feet . 
Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward . 
Krum was sprawled on the forest floor . 
He seemed to be unconscious . 
There was no sign at all of Mr . Crouch . 
Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids . 
" Stunned , " he said softly . 
His half - moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees . 
" Should I go and get someone ? " said Harry . 
" Madam Pomfrey ? " " No , " said Dumbledore swiftly . 
" Stay here . " 
He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid's cabin . 
Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird . 
Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again , pointed his wand at him , and muttered , " Ennervate . " 
Krum opened his eyes . 
He looked dazed . 
When he saw Dumbledore , he tried to sit up , but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still . 
" He attacked me ! " Krum muttered , putting a hand up to his head . 
The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them , and Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his heels . 
He was carrying his crossbow . 
" Professor Dumbledore ! " he said , his eyes widening . 
" Harry - what the - ? " " Hagrid , I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff , " said Dumbledore . " His student has been attacked . 
" I'm here . " 
" Damn leg , " he said furiously . 
what's happened ? 
Snape said something about Crouch - " " Crouch ? " said Hagrid blankly . 
" Karkaroff , please , Hagrid ! " said Dumbledore sharply . 
" Oh yeah . 
. ' . right y ' are , Professor . . 
" I don't know where Barty Crouch is , " Dumbledore told Moody , " but it is essential that we find him . " 
" I'm onto it , " growled Moody , and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest . 
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning . 
He was wearing his sleek silver furs , and he looked pale and agitated . 
" What is this ? " he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and Dumbledore and Harry beside him . 
" What's going on ? " " I vos attacked ! " said Krum , sitting up now and rubbing his head . 
" Mr . 
Crouch or votever his name - " " Crouch attacked you ? 
Crouch attacked you ? 
" It is a plot ! 
You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses , Dumbledore ! 
This is not an equal competition ! 
Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action ! 
I smell double - dealing and corruption in this whole affair , and you , Dumbledore , you , with your talk of closer international wizarding links , of rebuilding old ties , of forgetting old differences - here's what I think of you ! " Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore's feet . 
In one swift movement , Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff's furs , lifted him into the air , and slammed him against a nearby tree . 
" Apologize ! " Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath , Hagrid's massive fist at his throat , his feet dangling in midair . 
" Hagrid , no ! " Dumbledore shouted , his eyes flashing . 
Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree , and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots ; a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head . 
" Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle , Hagrid , " said Dumbledore sharply . 
" Maybe I'd better stay here . 
. " " You will take Harry back to school , Hagrid , " Dumbledore repeated firmly . 
" Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower . 
And Harry - I want you to stay there . 
Anything you might want to do - any owls you might want to send - they can wait until morning , do you understand me ? " " Er - yes , " said Harry , staring at him . 
How had Dumbledore known that , at that very moment , he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius , to tell him what had happened ? 
" I ' ll leave Fang with yeh . 
Headmaster , " Hagrid said , staring menacingly at Karkaroff , who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree , tangled in furs and tree roots . 
" Stay , Fang . 
C ' mon , Harry . " 
They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle . 
" How dare he , " Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake . 
" How dare he accuse Dumbledore . 
Like Dumbledore'd do anythin ' like that . 
Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs ' place . 
An ' you ! " Hagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry , who looked up at him , taken aback . 
He's from Durmstrang , Harry ! 
' Magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own - " " Krum's all right ! " said Harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall . 
" The less you lot ' ave ter do with these foreigners , the happier yeh ' ll be . 
Ha ! 
Hagrid was in such a bad mood , Harry was quite glad to say good - bye to him in front of the Fat Lady . 
He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting , to tell them what had happened . 
It comes down to this , " said Hermione , rubbing her forehead . 
" Either Mr . Crouch attacked Viktor , or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn't looking . " 
" It must ' ve been Crouch , " said Ron at once . 
" I don't think so , " said Harry , shaking his head . 
" You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds , haven't I told you enough times ? " said Hermione . 
" Okay . . . 
hows this for a theory , " said Ron excitedly . 
" Krum attacked Crouch no , wait for it - and then Stunned himself ! " " And Mr . Crouch evaporated , did he ? " said Hermione coldly . 
" Oh yeah . . 
It was daybreak . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius . 
Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds . 
All three of them were puffy - eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr . Crouch . 
" Just go through it again , Harry , " said Hermione . 
" What did Mr . Crouch actually say ? " " I ' ve told you , he wasn't making much sense , " said Harry . 
" He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something . 
He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins , and he seemed to think she was dead . 
He kept saying stuff was his fault . . . . 
He mentioned his son . " 
" Well , that was his fault , " said Hermione testily . 
" He was out of his mind , " said Harry . 
" Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive , and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions . " 
" And . . . 
remind me what he said about You - Know - Who ? " said Ron tentatively . 
" I ' ve told you , " Harry repeated dully . 
" He said he's getting stronger . " 
There was a pause . 
" He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort , " said Harry , and Ron winced at the sound of the name . 
" He was having real trouble stringing two words together , but that was when he seemed to know where he was , and know what he wanted to do . 
He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore . " 
Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters . 
' The headmaster is busy . 
Potter . . . 
" We need to see Professor Moody , " said Hermione . 
" Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds , " said Ron , " because it only shows up to the boundaries , doesn't - " " Shh ! " said Hermione suddenly . 
Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery . 
Harry could hear two voices arguing , coming closer and closer . 
" - that's blackmail , that is , we could get into a lot of trouble for that - " " - we ' ve tried being polite ; it's time to play dirty , like him . 
He wouldn't like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did - " " I'm telling you , if you put that in writing , it's blackmail ! " 
The Owlery door banged open . 
Fred and George came over the threshold , then froze at the sight of Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
" What ' re you doing here ? " 
Ron and Fred said at the same time . 
" Sending a letter , " said Harry and George in unison . 
" What , at this time ? " said Hermione and Fred . 
Fred grinned . 
" Fine - we won't ask you what you ' re doing , if you don't ask us , " he said . 
He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands . 
Harry glanced at it , but Fred , whether accidentally or on purpose , shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered . 
Ron didn't move . 
" Who ' re you blackmailing ? " he said . 
The grin vanished from Fred's face . 
Harry saw George half glance at Fred , before smiling at Ron . " Don't be stupid , I was only joking , " he said easily . 
" Didn't sound like that , " said Ron . Fred and George looked at each other . 
Then Fred said abruptly , " I ' ve told you before , Ron , keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is . 
Can't see why you would , but - " " It's my business if you ' re blackmailing someone , " said Ron . " George's right , you could end up in serious trouble for that . " 
" Told you , I was joking , " said George . 
He walked over to Fred , pulled the letter out of his hands , and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl . 
" No , I won't ! " said Ron hotly . 
George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off . 
George turned around and grinned at Ron . " Well , stop telling people what to do then . 
See you later . " 
He and Fred left the Owlery . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stared at one another . 
" You don't think they know something about all this , do you ? " 
Hermione whispered . 
" About Crouch and everything ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" If it was something that serious , they'd tell someone . 
They'd tell Dumbledore . " 
" What's the matter ? " 
Hermione asked him . 
" Well . . 
. " said Ron slowly , " I dunno if they would . 
They're . . . 
they ' re obsessed with making money lately , I noticed it when I was hanging around with them when - you know - " " We weren't talking . " 
Harry finished the sentence for him . 
Hermione was looking uncomfortable now . 
" Yes , but . . . 
they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold . " 
" Wouldn't they ? " said Ron , looking skeptical . 
" I dunno . . . 
they don't exactly mind breaking rules , do they ? " 
Ron . . . 
. " " Are you mad ? " said Ron . " Tell Percy ? 
He stared at the window through which Fred and George's owl had departed , then said , " Come on , let's get some breakfast . " 
" D ' you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody ? " Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" He'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn ; he ' ll think we ' re trying to attack him while he's asleep . 
Let's give it till break . " 
Harry kept checking Ron's watch , having finally discarded his own , but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too . 
All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept ; even Hermione wasn't taking her usual notes , but was sitting with her head on her hand , gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus . 
When the bell finally rang , they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it . 
He looked as tired as they felt . 
" Professor Moody ? " 
Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd . 
" Hello , Potter , " growled Moody . 
His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years , who sped up , looking nervous ; it rolled into the back of Moody's head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again . 
" Come in here . " 
He stood back to let them into his empty classroom , limped in after them , and closed the door . 
" Did you find him ? " 
Harry asked without preamble . 
" Mr . 
Crouch ? " " No , " said Moody . 
He moved over to his desk , sat down , stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan , and pulled out his hip flask . 
" Did you use the map ? " 
Harry said . 
Summoned it from my office into the forest . 
" So he did Disapparate ? " said Ron . " You can't Disapparate on the grounds , Ron ! " said Hermione . 
Moody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione . 
Granger . " 
" Well , he wasn't invisible , " said Harry . 
" The map shows invisible people . 
" But under his own steam ? " said Hermione eagerly , " or because someone made him ? " 
" Yeah , someone could ' ve - could ' ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him , couldn't they ? " said Ron quickly , looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror . 
" We can't rule out kidnap , " growled Moody . 
" Could be anywhere , " said Moody , shaking his head . 
" Only thing we know for sure is that he's not here . " 
He yawned widely , so that his scars stretched , and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth . 
The Ministry ' ll be looking for him now , Dumbledore's notified them . 
Potter , you just keep your mind on the third task . " 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" Oh yeah . . 
He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous night . 
" Should be right up your street , this one , " said Moody , looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin . 
" From what Dumbledore's said , you ' ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times . 
Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year , didn't you ? " " We helped , " Ron said quickly . 
" Me and Hermione helped . " 
Moody grinned . 
" In the meantime .. . 
constant vigilance , Potter . 
Constant vigilance . " 
The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it . 
I'm keeping an eye on things , but all the same . . . 
Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning . 
It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione , clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak . 
She took the newspaper , scanned the first few pages , said , " Ha ! 
She hasn't got wind of Crouch ! " then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last . 
Harry - what do you think you are playing at , walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum ? 
I want you to swear , by return owl , that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night . 
It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark . 
You could have been killed . 
If someone's trying to attack you , they ' re on their last chance . 
Stay close to Ron and Hermione , do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours , and arm yourself for the third task . 
Practice Stunning and Disarming . 
There's nothing you can do about Crouch . 
I'm waiting for your letter giving me your word you won't stray out - of - bounds again . 
" After all the stuff he did at school ! " " He's worried about you ! " said Hermione sharply . 
" Just like Moody and Hagrid ! 
So listen to them ! " 
" No one's tried to attack me all year , " said Harry . 
" No one's done anything to me at all - " " Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire , " said Hermione . 
Harry . 
Snuffles is right . 
Maybe this is the task they ' re going to get you . " 
" Look , " said Harry impatiently , " let's say Sirius is right , and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch . 
So it doesn't look like I'm their target , does it ? " 
" Harry , I don't understand it either , " said Hermione desperately . 
And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you ' re not going to go sneaking off alone again . " 
For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron , looking up hexes , or else in empty classrooms , which they sneaked into to practice . 
Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell , which he had never used before . 
The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron's and Hermione's part . 
" Can't we kidnap Mrs . Norris ? " 
Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom , having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row . 
" Let's Stun her for a bit . 
Or you could use Dobby , Harry , I bet he'd do anything to help you . 
I'm not complaining or anything " - he got gingerly to his feet , rubbing his backside - " but I'm aching all over . 
... " " Well , you keep missing the cushions , don't you ! " said Hermione impatiently , rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell , which Flitwick had left in a cabinet . 
" Just try and fall backward ! " 
" Once you ' re Stunned , you can't aim too well , Hermione ! 
" said Ron angrily . 
" And we don't have to worry about Disarming , because he's been able to do that for ages . 
... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening . " 
She looked down the list they had made in the library . 
" I like the look of this one , " she said , " this Impediment Curse . 
Should slow down anything that's trying to attack you . 
Harry . 
They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroom . 
" See you at dinner ! " said Hermione , and she set off for Arithmancy , while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower , and Divination . 
Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows . 
The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled . 
" It's going to be boiling in Trelawney's room , she never puts out that fire , " said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor . 
He was quite right . 
" My dears , " said Professor Trelawney , sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes , " we have almost finished our work on planetary divination . 
Today , however , will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars , for he is placed most interestingly at the present time . 
If you will all look this way , I will dim the lights . . . 
She waved her wand and the lamps went out . 
The fire was the only source of light now . 
Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted , from under her chair , a miniature model of the solar system , contained within a glass dome . 
It was a beautiful thing ; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun , all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass . 
Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune . 
The heavily perfumed fumes washed over him , and the breeze from the window played across his face . 
He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain . 
His eyelids began to droop . . . . 
He was riding on the back of an eagle owl , soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old , ivy - covered house set high on a hillside . 
Lower and lower they flew , the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry's face , until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered . 
Now they were flying along a gloomy passageway , to a room at the very end . . . 
through the door they went , into a dark room whose windows were boarded up .... 
Harry had left the owl's back ... he was watching , now , as it fluttered across the room , into a chair with its back to him . . . . 
There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair . . . 
One was a huge snake . . . the other was a man ... a short , balding man , a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug . . . . 
" You are in luck , Wormtail , " said a cold , high - pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed . 
" You are very fortunate indeed . 
He is dead . " 
" My Lord ! " gasped the man on the floor . 
" My Lord , I am ... I am so pleased . . . 
... " " Nagini , " said the cold voice , " you are out of luck . 
there is still Harry Potter . 
Harry could see its tongue fluttering . 
" Now , Wormtail , " said the cold voice , " perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you . 
... " " My Lord ... no ... I beg you . . 
The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair . 
" Crucio ! " said the cold voice . 
Wormtail screamed , screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire , the screaming filled Harry's ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain ; he was yelling too ... Voldemort would hear him , would know he was there . . . . 
" Harry ! 
Harry ! " 
Harry opened his eyes . 
He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney's room with his hands over his face . 
His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering . 
The pain had been real . 
The whole class was standing around him , and Ron was kneeling next to him , looking terrified . 
" You all right ? " he said . 
" Of course he isn't ! " said Professor Trelawney , looking thoroughly excited . 
Her great eyes loomed over Harry , gazing at him . 
" What was it . 
Potter ? 
A premonition ? 
What did you see ? " " Nothing , " Harry lied . 
He sat up . 
He could feel himself shaking . 
" You were clutching your scar ! " said Professor Trelawney . 
" You were rolling on the floor , clutching your scar ! 
Come now . 
Harry looked up at her . " I need to go to the hospital wing , I think , " he said . 
" Bad headache . " 
" If you leave now , you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever - " " I don't want to see anything except a headache cure , " said Harry . 
He stood up . 
" See you later , " Harry muttered to Ron , and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor , ignoring Professor Trelawney , who was wearing an expression of great frustration , as though she had just been denied a real treat . 
When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder , however , he did not set off for the hospital wing . 
He had no intention whatsoever of going there . 
Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again , and Harry was going to follow his advice : He was going straight to Dumbledore's office . 
He marched down the corridors , thinking about what he had seen in the dream . . . it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive . . . . 
but the owl had brought good news , the blunder had been repaired , somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake . . . 
he , Harry , was going to be fed to it instead . . . . 
Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office without noticing . 
He blinked , looked around , realized what he had done , and retraced his steps , stopping in front of it . 
Then he remembered that he didn't know the password . 
The gargoyle did not move . 
" Okay , " said Harry , staring at it , " Pear Drop . 
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans ... oh no , he doesn't like them , does he ? ... oh just open , can't you ? " he said angrily . 
" I really need to see him , its urgent ! " 
Cluster ! " The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside . 
Harry blinked . 
" Cockroach Cluster ? " he said , amazed . 
" I was only joking . 
... " He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase , which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him , taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker . 
He could hear voices from inside the office . 
" Dumbledore , I'm afraid I don't see the connection , don't see it at all ! " It was the voice of the Minister of Magic , Cornelius Fudge . 
I agree we would have expected to have found her by now , but all the same , we ' ve no evidence of foul play , Dumbledore , none at all . 
As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch's ! " " And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch , Minister ? " said Moody's growling voice . 
" I see two possibilities , Alastor , " said Fudge . 
" Well , I ' ll reserve judgment until after I ' ve seen the place where he was found , but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage ? 
Dumbledore , you know what that woman is ? " " I consider her to be a very able headmistress - and an excellent dancer , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Dumbledore , come ! " said Fudge angrily . 
" Don't you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid ? 
" I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced , Cornelius . " 
" Can we wrap up this discussion ? " 
growled Moody . 
" Yes , yes , let's go down to the grounds , then , " said Fudge impatiently . 
" No , it's not that , " said Moody , " it's just that Potter wants a word with you , Dumbledore . 
He's just outside the door . " 
CHAPTER THIRTY : THE PENSIEVE 
The door of the office opened . 
" Hello , Potter , " said Moody . 
" Come in , then . " 
Harry walked inside . 
He had been inside Dumbledore's office once before ; it was a very beautiful , circular room , lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts , all of whom were fast asleep , their chests rising and falling gently . 
" Harry ! " said Fudge jovially , moving forward . 
" How are you ? " 
" Fine , " Harry lied . 
" We were just talking about the night when Mr . Crouch turned up on the grounds , " said Fudge . 
" It was you who found him , was it not ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Yes , well , " said Fudge , looking embarrassed , " we ' re about to go for a short walk on the grounds , Harry , if you ' ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class - " " I wanted to talk to you . 
Professor , " Harry said quickly , looking at Dumbledore , who gave him a swift , searching look . 
" Wait here for me , Harry , " he said . 
" Our examination of the grounds will not take long . " 
They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door . 
After a minute or so , Harry heard the clunks of Moody's wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below . 
He looked around . 
" Hello , Fawkes , " he said . 
Fawkes , Professor Dumbledore's phoenix , was standing on his golden perch beside the door . 
The size of a swan , with magnificent scarlet - and - gold plumage , he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry . 
Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore's desk . 
For several minutes , he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames , thinking about what he had just heard , and running his fingers over his scar . 
He felt much calmer , somehow , now that he was in Dumbledore's office , knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream . 
Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk . 
The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf . 
A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt , which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year . 
The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor , founder of Harry's House . 
He was gazing at it , remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost , when he noticed a patch of silvery light , dancing and shimmering on the glass case . 
He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver - white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him , whose door had not been closed properly . 
Harry hesitated , glanced at Fawkes , then got up , walked across the office , and pulled open the cabinet door . 
A shallow stone basin lay there , with odd carvings around the edge : runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize . 
It was a bright , whitish silver , and it was moving ceaselessly ; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind , and then , like clouds , separated and swirled smoothly . 
It looked like light made liquid - or like wind made solid - Harry couldn't make up his mind . 
He wanted to touch it , to find out what it felt like , but nearly four years ' experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do . 
He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes , cast a nervous look around the office , looked back at the contents of the basin , and prodded them . 
The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast . 
Harry bent closer , his head right inside the cabinet . 
The silvery substance had become transparent ; it looked like glass . 
He looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin - and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance , a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling . 
The room was dimly lit ; he thought it might even be underground , for there were no windows , merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts . 
Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance , Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels . 
An empty chair stood in the very center of the room . 
There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling . 
Chains encircled the arms of it , as though its occupants were usually tied to it . 
Where was this place ? 
It surely wasn't Hogwarts ; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle . 
Moreover , the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults , and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts . 
They seemed , he thought , to be waiting for something ; even though he could only see the tops of their hats , all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction , and none of them were talking to one another . 
The basin being circular , and the room he was observing square , Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it . 
He leaned even closer , tilting his head , trying to see ... 
The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring . 
Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch - Harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin But his head did not hit the stone bottom . 
He was falling through something icycold and black ; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool And suddenly , Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin , a bench raised high above the others . 
He looked up at the high stone ceiling , expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring , but there was nothing there but dark , solid stone . 
Harry looked around him . 
Not one of the witches and wizards in the room ( and there were at least two hundred of them ) was looking at him . 
Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room . 
He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore . 
" Professor ! " 
Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper . 
" I'm sorry - I didn't mean to - I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet - I - where are we ? " 
But Dumbledore didn't move or speak . 
He ignored Harry completely . 
Like every other wizard on the benches , he was staring into the far corner of the room , where there was a door . 
Harry gazed , nonplussed , at Dumbledore , then around at the silently watchful crowd , then back at Dumbledore . 
and unless he was very much mistaken , something of the sort had happened again ... Harry raised his right hand , hesitated , and then waved it energetically in from of 
Dumbledore's face . 
Dumbledore did not blink , look around at Harry , or indeed move at all . 
And that , in Harry's opinion , settled the matter . 
He was inside a memory , and this was not the present - day Dumbledore . 
Yet it couldn't be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver - haired , just like the present - day Dumbledore . 
But what was this place ? 
What were all these wizards waiting for ? 
Harry looked around more carefully . 
The room , as he had suspected when observing it from above , was almost certainly underground - more of a dungeon than a room , he thought . 
There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place ; there were no pictures on the walls , no decorations at all ; just these serried rows of benches , rising in levels all around the room , all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms . 
The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered - or at least one man , flanked by two dementors . 
Harry's insides went cold . 
The dementors - tall , hooded creatures whose faces were concealed - were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room , each grasping one of the man's arms with their dead and rotten - looking hands . 
The man between them looked as though he was about to faint , and Harry couldn't blame him ... he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory , but he remembered their power only too well . 
The watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room . 
The door swung shut behind them . 
Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was Karkaroff . 
Unlike Dumbledore , Karkaroff looked much younger ; his hair and goatee were black . 
He was not dressed in sleek furs , but in thin and ragged robes . 
He was shaking . 
Even as Harry watched , the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff's arms , binding him there . 
" Igor Karkaroff , " said a curt voice to Harry's left . 
Harry looked around and saw Mr . Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him . 
Crouch's hair was dark , his face was much less lined , he looked fit and alert . 
" You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . 
You have given us to understand that you have important information for us . " 
" I have , sir , " he said , and although his voice was very scared , Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it . 
" I wish to be of use to the Ministry . 
I wish to help . 
I - I know that the Ministry is trying to - to round up the last of the Dark Lords supporters . 
I am eager to assist in any way I can . 
... " There was a murmur around the benches . 
Some of the wizards and witches were surveying Karkaroff with interest , others with pronounced mistrust . 
Then Harry heard , quite distinctly , from Dumbledores other side , a familiar , growling voice saying , " Filth . " 
Harry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore . 
Mad - Eye Moody was sitting there - except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance . 
He did not have his magical eye , but two normal ones . 
Both were looking down upon Karkaroff , and both were narrowed in intense dislike . 
" Crouch is going to let him out , " Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore . 
" He's done a deal with him . 
Took me six months to track him down , and Crouch is going to let him go if he's got enough new names . 
Let's hear his information , I say , and throw him straight back to the dementors . " 
Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long , crooked nose . 
" Ah , I was forgetting . . . 
you don't like the dementors , do you , Albus ? " said Moody with a sardonic smile . 
" No , " said Dumbledore calmly , " I'm afraid I don't . 
I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures . " 
Moody said softly . 
" You say you have names for us , Karkaroff , " said Mr . Crouch . 
He preferred that we - I mean to say , his supporters - and I regret now , very deeply , that I ever counted myself among them - " " Get on with it , " sneered Moody . 
" - we never knew the names of every one of our fellows - He alone knew exactly who we all were - " " Which was a wise move , wasn't it , as it prevented someone like you , Karkaroff , from turning all of them in , " muttered Moody . 
" Yet you say you have some names for us ? " said Mr . Crouch . 
" I - I do , " said Karkaroff breathlessly . 
" And these were important supporters , mark you . 
I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him , and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely - " " These names are ? " said Mr . Crouch sharply . 
Karkaroff drew a deep breath . 
" There was Antonin Dolohov , " he said . 
" I - I saw him torture countless Muggles and - and non - supporters of the Dark Lord . " " And helped him do it , " murmured Moody . 
" We have already apprehended Dolohov , " said Crouch . 
" He was caught shortly after yourself . " 
" Indeed ? " said Karkaroff , his eyes widening . 
" I - I am delighted to hear it ! " 
But he didn't look it . 
Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him . 
One of his names was worthless . 
" Any others ? " said Crouch coldly . 
" Why , yes ... there was Rosier , " said Karkaroff hurriedly . 
" Evan Rosier . " 
" Rosier is dead , " said Crouch . 
" He was caught shortly after you were too . 
He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle . " 
Harry looked around at him once more , and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to Dumbledore . 
" No - no more than Rosier deserved ! " said Karkaroff , a real note of panic in his voice now . 
Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the Ministry . 
Karkaroff's eyes darted toward the door in the corner , behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood , waiting . 
" Any more ? " said Crouch . 
" Yes ! " said Karkaroff . 
" There was Travers - he helped murder the McKinnons ! 
Rookwood , who was a spy , and passed He - Who - Must - Not - BeNamed useful information from inside the Ministry itself ! " 
Harry could tell that , this time , Karkaroff had struck gold . 
" Rookwood ? " said Mr . Crouch , nodding to a witch sitting in front of him , who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment . 
" Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries ? " 
" The very same , " said Karkaroff eagerly . 
" I believe he used a network of wellplaced wizards , both inside the Ministry and out , to collect information - " " But Travers and Mulciber we have , " said Mr . Crouch . 
" Very well , Karkaroff , if that is all , you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide - " " Not yet ! " cried Karkaroff , looking quite desperate . 
" Wait , I have more ! " 
Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight , his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard . 
" Snape ! " he shouted . 
" Severus Snape ! " " Snape has been cleared by this council , " said Crouch disdainfully . 
" He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore . " " No ! " shouted Karkaroff , straining at the chains that bound him to the chair . 
" I assure you ! 
Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! " Dumbledore had gotten to his feet . 
" I have given evidence already on this matter , " he said calmly . 
" Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater . 
However , he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort's downfall and turned spy for us , at great personal risk . 
He is now no more a Death Eater than I am . " 
Harry turned to look at Mad - Eye Moody . 
He was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind Dumbledore's back . 
" Very well , Karkaroff , " Crouch said coldly , " you have been of assistance . 
I shall review your case . 
You will return to Azkaban in the meantime . 
... " Mr . Crouch's voice faded . 
Harry looked around ; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke ; everything was fading ; he could see only his own body - all else was swirling darkness . . . . 
And then , the dungeon returned . 
Harry was sitting in a different seat , still on the highest bench , but now to the left side of Mr . Crouch . 
The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another , almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event . 
Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite . 
She had short blonde hair , was wearing magenta robes , and was sucking the end of an acid - green quill . 
It was , unmistakably , a younger Rita Skeeter . 
Harry looked around ; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again , wearing different robes . 
Mr . Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer , gaunter . . . . 
Harry understood . 
It was a different memory , a different day ... a different trial . 
The door in the corner opened , and Ludo Bagman walked into the room . 
This was not , however , a Ludo Bagman gone to seed , but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch - playing fitness . 
His nose wasn't broken now ; he was tall and lean and muscular . 
Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair , but it did not bind him there as it had bound Karkaroff , and Bagman , perhaps taking heart from this , glanced around at the watching crowd , waved at a couple of them , and managed a small smile . 
" Ludo Bagman , you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters , " said Mr . 
Crouch . 
" We have heard the evidence against you , and are about to reach our verdict . 
Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment ? " 
Harry couldn't believe his ears . 
Ludo Bagman , a Death Eater ? 
" Only , " said Bagman , smiling awkwardly , " well - I know I ' ve been a bit of an idiot - " One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently . 
Mr . Crouch did not appear to share their feelings . 
He was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike . 
He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again . 
... " " Ludovic Bagman , you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort's supporters , " said Mr . Crouch . 
Several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up , shaking their heads , and even their fists , at Mr . Crouch . 
" But I ' ve told you , I had no idea ! " 
" None at all ! 
I thought I was collecting information for our side ! 
And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over , you know ... I mean , I can't keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life , can I ? " There were titters from the crowd . 
" It will be put to the vote , " said Mr . Crouch coldly . 
He turned to the right - hand side of the dungeon . 
those in favor of imprisonment ... " Harry looked toward the right - hand side of the dungeon . 
Not one person raised their hand . 
Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap . 
One of the witches on the jury stood up . 
" Yes ? " barked Crouch . 
" We'd just like to congratulate Mr . Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday , " the witch said breathlessly . 
Mr . Crouch looked furious . 
The dungeon was ringing with applause now . 
" Despicable , " Mr . Crouch spat at Dumbledore , sitting down as Bagman walked out of the dungeon . 
The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry . . . 
And the dungeon dissolved again . 
When it had returned , Harry looked around . 
He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr . Crouch , but the atmosphere could not have been more different . 
There was total silence , broken only by the dry sobs of a frail , wispy - looking witch in the seat next to Mr . Crouch . 
She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands . 
Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before . 
" Bring them in , " he said , and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon . 
The door in the corner opened yet again . 
Six dementors entered this time , flanking a group of four people . 
Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr . Crouch . 
The dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor . 
There was a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch ; a thinner and more nervous - looking man , whose eyes were darting around the crowd ; a woman with thick , shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes , who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne ; and a boy in his late teens , who looked nothing short of petrified . 
He was shivering , his strawcolored hair all over his face , his freckled skin milk - white . 
The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat , whimpering into her handkerchief . 
Crouch stood up . 
He looked down upon the four in front of him , and there was pure hatred in his face . 
" You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law , " he said clearly , " so that we may pass judgment on you , for a crime so heinous - " " Father , " said the boy with the straw - colored hair . 
. please . . . 
" We have heard the evidence against you . 
The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse , believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named - " " Father , I didn't ! " shrieked the boy in chains below . 
" I didn't , I swear it . 
You planned to restore He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named to power , and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong . 
I now ask the jury - " " Mother ! " screamed the boy below , and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob , rocking backward and forward . 
Mother , I didn't do it , it wasn't me ! " " I now ask the jury , " shouted Mr . Crouch , " to raise their hands if they believe , as I do , that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban ! " 
In unison , the witches and wizards along the right - hand side of the dungeon raised their hands . 
The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman , their faces full of savage triumph . 
" No ! Mother , no ! 
I didn't do it , I didn't do it , I didn't know ! 
The boys ' three companions rose quietly from their seats ; the woman with the heavy - lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called , " The Dark Lord will rise again , Crouch ! 
Throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! 
He will rise again and will come for us , he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters ! 
We alone tried to find him ! " 
But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors , even though Harry could see their cold , draining power starting to affect him . 
The crowd was jeering , some of them on their feet , as the woman swept out of the dungeon , and the boy continued to struggle . 
" I'm your son ! " " You are no son of mine ! " bellowed Mr . Crouch , his eyes bulging suddenly . 
" I have no son ! " 
She had fainted . 
Crouch appeared not to have noticed . 
No ! No ! Father , please ! " " I think . 
Harry , it is time to return to my office , " said a quiet voice in Harrys ear . 
Harry started . 
He looked around . 
Then he looked on his other side . 
There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right , watching Crouch's son being dragged away by the dementors - and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left , looking right at him . 
" Come , " said the Dumbledore on his left , and he put his hand under Harrys elbow . 
Harry felt himself rising into the air ; the dungeon dissolved around him ; for a moment , all was blackness , and then he felt as though he had done a slow - motion somersault , suddenly landing flat on his feet , in what seemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore's sunlit office . 
The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him , and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him . 
" Professor , " Harry gasped , " I know I shouldn't ' ve - I didn't mean - the cabinet door was sort of open and - " " I quite understand , " said Dumbledore . 
He lifted the basin , carried it over to his desk , placed it upon the polished top , and sat down in the chair behind it . 
He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him . 
Harry did so , staring at the stone basin . 
The contents had returned to their original , silvery - white state , swirling and rippling beneath his gaze . 
" What is it ? " 
Harry asked shakily . 
" This ? 
It is called a Pensieve , " said Dumbledore . " I sometimes find , and I am sure you know the feeling , that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind . " 
" At these times , " said Dumbledore , indicating the stone basin , " I use the Pensieve . 
It becomes easier to spot patterns and links , you understand , when they are in this form . " 
" You mean . . . 
that stuff's your thoughts ? " 
Harry said , staring at the swirling white substance in the basin . 
" Certainly , " said Dumbledore . " Let me show you . " 
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair , near his temple . 
When he took the wand away , hair seemed to be clinging to it - but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery - white substance that filled the Pensieve . 
Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin , and Harry , astonished , saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl . 
Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it , rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold .... and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape's , who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling , his voice echoing slightly . 
" It's coming back . . . 
Karkaroff's too . . . 
stronger and clearer than ever ... " 
He peered over the top of his half - moon spectacles at Harry , who was gaping at Snape's face , which was continuing to swirl around the bowl . 
Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly . 
" I'm sorry , " Harry mumbled . 
Dumbledore shook his head . 
" Curiosity is not a sin , " he said . 
" But we should exercise caution with our curiosity . . . 
yes , indeed ... " Frowning slightly , he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand . 
Instantly , a figure rose out of it , a plump , scowling girl of about sixteen , who began to revolve slowly , with her feet still in the basin . 
When she spoke , her voice echoed as Snape's had done , as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin . 
" He put a hex on me , Professor Dumbledore , and I was only teasing him , sir , I only said I'd seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday . . . 
. " " But why . 
Bertha , " said Dumbledore sadly , looking up at the now silently revolving girl , " why did you have to follow him in the first place ? " 
" Bertha ? " 
Harry whispered , looking up at her . " Is that - was that Bertha Jorkins ? " " Yes , " said Dumbledore , prodding the thoughts in the basin again ; Bertha sank back into them , and they became silvery and opaque once more . 
The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore's face , and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking . 
He knew , of course , that Dumbledore was getting on in years , but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man . 
" So , Harry , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Before you got lost in my thoughts , you wanted to tell me something . " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Professor - I was in Divination just now , and - er - I fell asleep . " 
Continue . " 
" Well , I had a dream , " said Harry . 
" A dream about Lord Voldemort . 
He was torturing Wormtail . . . 
you know who Wormtail - " " I do know , " said Dumbledore promptly . 
" Please continue . " 
" Voldemort got a letter from an owl . 
He said someone was dead . 
Then he said , Wormtail wouldn't be fed to the snake - there was a snake beside his chair . 
He said - he said he'd be feeding me to it , instead . 
Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail - and my scar hurt , " Harry said . 
Dumbledore merely looked at him . 
" Er - that's all , " said Harry . 
" I see , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" I see . 
Now , has your scar hurt at any other time this year , excepting the time it woke you up over the summer ? " 
" No , I - how did you know it woke me up over the summer ? " said Harry , astonished . 
" You are not Sirius's only correspondent , " said Dumbledore . " I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year . 
It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay . " 
Dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk . 
Every now and then , he placed his wand tip to his temple , removed another shining silver thought , and added it to the Pensieve . 
The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry couldn't make out anything clearly : It was merely a blur of color . 
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry . 
" My apologies , " he said quietly . 
He sat back down at his desk . 
" D ' you - d ' you know why my scar's hurting me ? " Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment , and then said , " I have a theory , no more than that . 
... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you , and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred . " 
" But . . . 
" So you think . . . 
that dream . . . 
Harry - did you see Voldemort ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" Just the back of his chair . 
But . . . 
but then how could he have held the wand ? " 
Harry said slowly . 
" How indeed ? " muttered Dumbledore . 
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while . 
Dumbledore was gazing across the room , and , every now and then , placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve . 
" Professor , " Harry said at last , " do you think he's getting stronger ? " 
" Voldemort ? " said Dumbledore , looking at Harry over the Pensieve . 
It was the characteristic , piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions , and always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even Moody's magical eye could not . 
" Once again . 
Harry , I can only give you my suspicions . " 
Dumbledore sighed again , and he looked older , and wearier , than ever . 
" The years of Voldemort's ascent to power , " he said , " were marked with disappearances . 
Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last . 
Mr . Crouch too has disappeared . . . 
And there was a third disappearance , one which the Ministry , I regret to say , do not consider of any importance , for it concerns a Muggle . 
His name was Frank Bryce , he lived in the village where Voldemort's father grew up , and he has not been seen since last August . 
You see , I read the Muggle newspapers , unlike most of my Ministry friends . " 
Dumbledore looked very seriously at Harry . 
" These disappearances seem to me to be linked . 
Harry nodded . 
Harry felt as though he ought to go , but his curiosity held him in his chair . 
" Professor ? " he said again . 
" Yes , Harry ? " said Dumbledore . " Er . . . 
could I ask you about . . . 
that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve ? " 
" You could , " said Dumbledore heavily . 
" I attended it many times , but some trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now . 
... " " You know - you know the trial you found me in ? 
The one with Crouch's son ? Well .... were they talking about Neville's parents ? " Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look . 
" Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother ? " he said . 
Harry shook his head , wondering , as he did so , how he could have failed to ask Neville this , in almost four years of knowing him . 
He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers , as you heard . " 
" So they ' re dead ? " said Harry quietly . 
" No , " said Dumbledore , his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before . 
" They are insane . 
They are both in St . Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . 
I believe Neville visits them , with his grandmother , during the holidays . 
They do not recognize him . " 
Harry sat there , horror - struck . 
He had never known . . . 
never , in four years , bothered to find out . . . 
" The Longbottoms were very popular , " said Dumbledore . " The attacks on them came after Voldemort's fall from power , just when everyone thought they were safe . 
The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it . 
" Then Mr . Crouch's son might not have been involved ? " said Harry slowly . 
Dumbledore shook his head . 
" As to that , I have no idea . " 
Harry sat in silence once more , watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl . 
but they concerned the guilt of living people . . . . 
" Er , " he said , " Mr . 
Bagman . 
.. " " ... has never been accused of any Dark activity since , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" Right , " said Harry hastily , staring at the contents of the Pensieve again , which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts . 
Snape's face was swimming on the surface again . 
Dumbledore glanced down into it , and then up at Harry . 
" No more has Professor Snape , " he said . 
Harry looked into Dumbledore's light blue eyes , and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it . 
" What made you think he'd really stopped supporting Voldemort , Professor ? " 
Dumbledore held Harrys gaze for a few seconds , and then said , " That , Harry , is a matter between Professor Snape and myself . " 
Harry knew that the interview was over ; Dumbledore did not look angry , yet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go . 
He stood up , and so did Dumbledore . 
" Harry , " he said as Harry reached the door . 
" Please do not speak about Neville's parents to anybody else . 
He has the right to let people know , when he is ready . " 
" Yes , Professor , " said Harry , turning to go . 
" And - " Harry looked back . 
Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve , his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light , looking older than ever . 
He stared at Harry for a moment , and then said , " Good luck with the third task . " 
Ron whispered . 
Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve , nearly everything Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward , he had now shared with Ron and Hermione - and , of course , with Sirius , to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore's office . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night , talking it all over until Harry's mind was reeling , until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off . 
Ron stared into the common room fire . 
Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly , even though the evening was warm . 
" And he trusts Snape ? " Ron said . 
" He really trusts Snape , even though he knows he was a Death Eater ? " " Yes , " said Harry . 
Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes . 
She was sitting with her forehead in her hands , staring at her knees . 
" Rita Skeeter , " she muttered finally . 
" How can you be worrying about her now ? " said Ron , in utter disbelief . 
" I'm not worrying about her , " Hermione said to her knees . 
" I'm just thinking . . . 
' I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl . 
' This is what she meant , isn't it ? 
She reported his trial , she knew he'd passed information to the Death Eaters . 
And Winky too , remember . . 
. ' Ludo 
Bagman's a bad wizard . ' 
" And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch ? " Ron said , turning back to Harry . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , " but he's only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage . " 
" We never thought of her , did we ? " said Ron slowly . 
" Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother . 
Look at Fudge , jumping to conclusions about her , just because she's part giant . 
Who needs that sort of prejudice ? 
I'd probably say I had big bones if I knew that's what I'd get for telling the truth . " 
Hermione looked at her watch . 
she said , looking shocked . 
" We were going to do the Impediment Curse ! 
We ' ll have to really get down to it tomorrow ! 
Come on . 
Harry , you need to get some sleep . " 
Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory . 
As Harry pulled on his pajamas , he looked over at Nevilles bed . 
True to his word to Dumbledore , he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville s parents . 
As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four - poster , he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you . 
He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan , but as he listened to Nevilles snores , he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did . 
Lying in the darkness , Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr . and Mrs . Longbottom . 
He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors . 
He understood how they had felt . . . . 
Then he remembered the milk - white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later . . . . 
It was Voldemort , Harry thought , staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness , it all came back to Voldemort . 
Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams , which would finish on the day of the third task , but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare . 
The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again . 
Everyone was looking forward to the third task , which would take place a week before the end of term . 
Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be , Moody was right : Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now , and this time he had some notice , some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead . 
Tired of walking in on Harry , Hermione , and Ron all over the school . 
Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes . 
Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse , a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers ; the Reductor Curse , which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way ; and the Four - Point Spell , a useful discovery of Hermiones that would make his wand point due north , therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze . 
He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm , though . 
This was supposed to cast a temporary , invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses ; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well - placed Jelly - Legs Jinx , and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counterjinx . 
" Some of these are bound to come in handy . " 
" Come and look at this , " said Ron , who was standing by the window . 
He was staring down onto the grounds . 
" What's Malfoy doing ? " 
Harry and Hermione went to see . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below . 
Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it . 
" He looks like he's using a walkie - talkie , " said Harry curiously . 
Come on , Harry , " she added briskly , turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room , " let's try that Shield Charm again . " 
Like Hermione , he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else . 
He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry's responsibility , nor was it within his power to influence it . 
If Voldemort is really getting stronger again , he wrote , my priority is to ensure your safety . 
He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore's protection , but all the same , take no risks : Concentrate on getting through that maze safely , and then we can turn our attention to other matters . 
Harry's nerves mounted as June the twenty - fourth drew closer , but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks . 
For one thing , he was confident that , this time , he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task . 
Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the third task . 
The post owls appeared , bringing Harry a good - luck card from Sirius . 
It was only a piece of parchment , folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front , but Harry appreciated it all the same . 
She unfolded the paper , glanced at the front page , and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it . 
" What ? " said Harry and Ron together , staring at her . " Nothing , " said Hermione quickly , trying to shove the paper out of sight , but Ron grabbed it . 
He stared at the headline and said , " No way . 
Not today . 
That old cow . " " What ? " said Harry . 
" It's about me , isn't it ? " said Harry . 
" No , " said Ron , in an entirely unconvincing tone . 
But before Harry could demand to see the paper . 
Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table . 
" Hey , Potter ! 
Potter ! 
How's your head ? 
You feeling all right ? 
Sure you ' re not going to go berserk on us ? " Malfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too . 
" Let me see it , " Harry said to Ron . " Give it here . " 
Very reluctantly , Ron handed over the newspaper . 
Potter , the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal , regularly collapses at school , and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead ( relic of the curse with which You - Know - Who attempted to kill him ) . 
It is possible , say top experts at St . Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries , that Potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by YouKnow - Who , and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deep - seated confusion . 
" He might even be pretending , " said one specialist . 
" Potter can speak Parseltongue , " reveals Draco Malfoy , a Hogwarts fourth year . 
" There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago , and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy . 
It was all hushed up , though . 
But he's made friends with werewolves and giants too . 
We think he'd do anything for a bit of power . " 
Parseltongue , the ability to converse with snakes , has long been considered a Dark Art . 
A member of the Dark Force Defense League , who wished to remain unnamed , stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue " as worthy of investigation . 
Personally , I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes , as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic , and are historically associated with evildoers . " 
Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament . 
Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament , the third task of which takes place this evening . 
Over at the Slytherin table , Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were laughing at him , tapping their heads with their fingers , pulling grotesquely mad faces , and waggling their tongues like snakes . 
" How did she know your scar hurt in Divination ? " Ron said . 
" I opened it to breathe . " 
" You were at the top of North Tower ! " Hermione said . 
" Your voice couldn't have carried all the way down to the grounds ! " " Well , you ' re the one who's supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging ! " said Harry . 
" I ' ve been trying ! " said Hermione . 
" But I ... but . . 
She slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair . 
" Are you all right ? " said Ron , frowning at her . " Yes , " said Hermione breathlessly . 
She ran her fingers through her hair again , and then held her hand up to her mouth , as though speaking into an invisible walkietalkie . 
Harry and Ron stared at each other . 
" I ' ve had an idea , " Hermione said , gazing into space . 
" I think I know . . . 
but she's not allowed . . . 
Just give me two seconds in the library - just to make sure ! " 
With that , Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall . 
" Oi ! " Ron called after her . 
What ' re you going to do in Binns's class - read again ? " 
Exempt from the end - of - term tests as a Triwizard champion , Harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far , looking up fresh hexes for the third task . 
" S ' pose so , " Harry said to Ron ; but just then . 
Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him . 
" Potter , the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast , " she said . 
" I'm aware of that , Potter , " she said . 
" The champions ' families are invited to watch the final task , you know . 
Harry gaped after her . 
" Dunno , " said Ron . " Harry , I'd better hurry , I'm going to be late for Binns . 
See you later . " 
Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall . 
He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered . 
Harry stayed where he was . 
But just as he was getting up , thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research , the door of the side chamber opened , and Cedric stuck his head out . 
" Harry , come on , they ' re waiting for you ! " Utterly perplexed . 
Harry got up . 
He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber . 
Cedric and his parents were just inside the door . 
Viktor Krum was over in a corner , conversing with his dark - haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian . 
On the other side of the room , Fleur was jabbering away in French to her mother . 
Fleur's little sister , Gabrielle , was holding her mother's hand . 
She waved at Harry , who waved back , grinning . 
Then he saw Mrs . Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace , beaming at him . 
Mrs . Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them . 
Harry ! " 
She bent down and kissed him on the cheek . 
" You all right ? " said Bill , grinning at Harry and shaking his hand . 
" Charlie wanted to come , but he couldn't get time off . 
He said you were incredible against the Horntail . " 
Fleur Delacour , Harry noticed , was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother's shoulder . 
Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them . 
" This is really nice of you , " Harry muttered to Mrs . Weasley . 
" I thought for a moment - the Dursleys - " " Hmm , " said Mrs . Weasley , pursing her lips . 
She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry , but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned . 
" It's great being back here , " said Bill , looking around the chamber ( Violet , the Fat Lady's friend , winked at him from her frame ) . 
Is that picture of the mad knight still around ? 
Sir Cadogan ? " " Oh yeah , " said Harry , who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year . 
" And the Fat Lady ? " said Bill . " She was here in my time , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning - " " What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning ? " said Bill , surveying his mother with amazement . 
Mrs . Weasley grinned , her eyes twinkling . 
Apollyon Pringle - he was the caretaker in those days - your father's still got the marks . " 
" Fancy giving us a tour , Harry ? " said Bill . " Yeah , okay , " said Harry , and they made their way back toward the door into the Great Hall . 
As they passed Amos Diggory , he looked around . 
" There you are , are you ? " he said , looking Harry up and down . 
" Bet you ' re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedrics caught you up on points , are you ? " 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" Ignore him , " said Cedric in a low voice to Harry , frowning after his father . 
" Didn't bother to correct her , though , did he ? " said Amos Diggory , loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs . Weasley and Bill . 
" Still , . . 
Mrs . Weasley said angrily . 
" I would have thought you'd know that , working at the Ministry ! " 
Mr . Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry , but his wife laid a hand on his arm , and he merely shrugged and turned away . 
Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs . Weasley , showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship . 
Mrs . Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow , which had been planted after she had left school , and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before Hagrid , a man called Ogg . " How's Percy ? " 
Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses . 
" Not good , " said Bill . " He's very upset , " said Mrs . Weasley , lowering her voice and glancing around . 
" The Ministry wants to keep Mr . Crouch's disappearance quiet , but Percy's been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr . Crouch has been sending in . 
They're not letting him fill in for Mr . Crouch as the fifth judge tonight . 
Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it . " 
They returned to the castle for lunch . 
" Mum - Bill ! " said Ron , looking stunned , as he joined the Gryffindor table . 
" What ' re you doing here ? " 
" Come to watch Harry in the last task ! " said Mrs . Weasley brightly . 
" I must say , it makes a lovely change , not having to cook . 
Fred , George , and Ginny came to sit next to them too , and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow ; he had forgotten to worry about that evening's task , and not until Hermione turned up , halfway through lunch , did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter . 
" Are you going to tell us - ? " Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs . Weasley . 
" Hello , Hermione , " said Mrs . Weasley , much more stiffly than usual . 
" Hello , " said Hermione , her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs . Weasley's face . 
Harry looked between them , then said , " Mrs . 
Because Hermione's not my girlfriend . " 
" Oh ! " said Mrs . Weasley " No - of course I didn't ! " 
Harry , Bill , and Mrs . Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle , and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast . 
Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now . 
Bagman looked quite cheerful , but Cornelius Fudge , who was sitting next to Madame Maxime , looked stern and was not talking . 
Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate , and Harry thought her eyes looked red . 
Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her , There were more courses than usual , but Harry , who was starting to feel really nervous now , didn't eat much . 
As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple , Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table , and silence fell . 
" Ladies and gentlemen , in five minutes ' time , I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament . 
Will the champions please follow Mr . Bagman down to the stadium now . " 
Harry got up . 
The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him ; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck , and he headed off out of the Great Hall with Cedric , Fleur , and Viktor . 
" Feeling all right . 
Harry ? " Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds . 
" Confident ? " " I'm okay , " said Harry . 
It was sort of true ; he was nervous , but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked , and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better . 
They walked onto the Quidditch field , which was now completely unrecognizable . 
A twenty - foot - high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it . 
There was a gap right in front of them : the entrance to the vast maze . 
Five minutes later , the stands had begun to fill ; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats . 
The sky was a deep , clear blue now , and the first stars were starting to appear . 
Hagrid , Professor Moody , Professor McGonagall , and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions . 
" We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze , " said Professor McGonagall to the champions . 
" If you get into difficulty , and wish to be rescued , send red sparks into the air , and one of us will come and get you , do you understand ? " 
The champions nodded . 
" Off you go , then ! " said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers . 
" Good luck . 
Harry , " Hagrid whispered , and the four of them walked away in different directions , to station themselves around the maze . 
Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat , muttered , " Sonorus , " and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands . 
" Ladies and gentlemen , the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin ! 
Tied in first place , with eighty - five points each - Mr . Cedric Diggory and Mr . Harry Potter , both of Hogwarts School ! " 
The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky . 
" In second place , with eighty points - Mr . Viktor Krum , of Durmstrang Institute ! " 
" And in third place - Miss Fleur Delacour , of Beauxbatons Academy ! " Harry could just make out Mrs . Weasley , Bill , Ron , and Hermione applauding Fleur politely , halfway up the stands . 
He waved up at them , and they waved back , beaming at him . 
" So ... on my whistle , Harry and Cedric ! " said Bagman . 
" Three - two - one - " He gave a short blast on his whistle , and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze . 
The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path , and , whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted , the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze . 
Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again . 
He pulled out his wand , muttered , " Lumos , " and heard Cedric do the same just behind him . 
After about fifty yards , they reached a fork . 
They looked at each other . 
" See you , " Harry said , and he took the left one , while Cedric took the right . 
Harry heard Bagman's whistle for the second time . 
Krum had entered the maze . 
Harry sped up . 
He turned right , and hurried on , holding his wand high over his head , trying to see as far ahead as possible . 
Bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time . 
All of the champions were now inside . 
The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him . 
" Point Me , " he whispered to his wand , holding it flat in his palm . 
That way was north , and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze . 
The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible . 
The path ahead was empty too , and when Harry reached a right turn and took it , he again found his way unblocked . 
It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security . 
He held out his wand , ready to attack , but its beam fell only upon Cedric , who had just hurried out of a path on the right - hand side . 
The sleeve of his robe was smoking . 
He shook his head and dived out of sight , along another path . 
Then , as he turned a corner , he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him . 
Harry could hear its rattling breath ; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him , but knew what he had to do .... 
He summoned the happiest thought he could , concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione , raised his wand , and cried , " Expecto Patronum ! " 
A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry's wand and galloped toward the dementor , which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes . . . . 
Riddikulus ! " 
There was a loud crack , and the shape - shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke . 
Left ... right ... left again . . . 
Twice he found himself facing dead ends . 
He did the Four - Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east . 
He turned back , took a right turn , and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him . 
Harry approached it cautiously , pointing the wand's beam at it . 
He wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way . 
" Reducio ! " he said . 
The spell shot straight through the mist , leaving it intact . 
Was it worth chancing it , or should he double back ? 
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence . 
" Fleur ? " 
Harry yelled . 
There was silence . 
He stared all around him . 
What had happened to her ? Her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead . 
He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist . 
The world turned upside down . 
Harry was hanging from the ground , with his hair on end , his glasses dangling off his nose , threatening to fall into the bottomless sky . 
He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there , terrified . 
It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass , which had now become the ceiling . 
He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet , he would fall away from the earth completely . 
But not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky . 
Did he dare move his foot ? 
He could hear the blood pounding in his ears . 
He had two choices - try and move , or send up red sparks , and get rescued and disqualified from the task . 
He shut his eyes , so he wouldn't be able to see the view of endless space below him , and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling . 
Immediately , the world righted itself . 
Harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground . 
He felt temporarily limp with shock . 
He took a deep , steadying breath , then got up again and hurried forward , looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist , which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight . 
He paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur . 
He was sure it had been she who had screamed . 
What had she met ? 
Was she all right ? 
Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . 
but at the same time , he couldn't help thinking . 
The cup was somewhere close by , and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running . 
What if he actually managed to win ? Fleetingly , and for the first time since he'd found himself champion , he saw again that image of himself , raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school . . . . 
Finally , he found a new route and started to jog along it , his wandlight waving , making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls . 
Cedric was right - it was enormous . 
Ten feet long , it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything . 
Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry's wand , which he pointed at it . 
" Stupefy ! " 
The spell hit the skrewt's armor and rebounded ; Harry ducked just in time , but could smell burning hair ; it had singed the top of his head . 
The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him . 
" Impedimenta ! " 
Harry yelled . 
The spell hit the skrewt's armor again and ricocheted off ; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over . 
Panting , Harry pushed himself away from it and ran , hard , in the opposite direction - the Impediment Curse was not permanent ; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment . 
He took a left path and hit a dead end , a right , and hit another ; forcing himself to stop , heart hammering , he performed the Four - Point Spell again , backtracked , and chose a path that would take him northwest . 
He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes , when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead . 
" What are you doing ? " yelled Cedric's voice . 
" What the hell d ' you think you ' re doing ? " 
And then Harry heard Krum's voice . 
" Crucio ! " 
It wasn't very effective , but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which Harry forced his leg , kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening ; he struggled through it , tearing his robes , and looking to his right , saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground , Krum standing over him . 
Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up . 
Krum turned and began to run . 
" Stupefy ! " 
Harry yelled . 
The spell hit Krum in the back ; he stopped dead in his tracks , fell forward , and lay motionless , facedown in the grass . 
" Are you all right ? " 
Harry said roughly , grabbing Cedric's arm . 
... I heard him , I turned around , and he had his wand on me . . . 
Cedric got up . 
He was still shaking . 
He and Harry looked down at Krum . " I can't believe this ... I thought he was all right , " Harry said , staring at Krum . " So did I , " said Cedric . 
" Did you hear Fleur scream earlier ? " said Harry . 
" You don't think Krum got her too ? " 
" I don't know , " said Harry slowly . 
" Should we leave him here ? " 
Cedric muttered . 
" No , " said Harry . 
" I reckon we should send up red sparks . 
" He'd deserve it , " Cedric muttered , but all the same , he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air , which hovered high above Krum , marking the spot where he lay . 
Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment , looking around them . 
Then Cedric said , " Well ... 
. " " What ? " said Harry . 
" Oh . . . 
yeah . . . 
right . . 
The two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking , then Harry turned left , and Cedric right . 
Harry moved on , continuing to use the Four - Point Spell , making sure he was moving in the right direction . 
His desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever , but he could hardly believe what he'd just seen Krum do . 
Every so often he hit more dead ends , but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze . 
Then , as he strode down a long , straight path , he saw movement once again , and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature , one which he had only seen in picture form , in his Monster Book of Monsters . 
It was a sphinx . 
It had the body of an over - large lion : great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft . 
Its head , however , was that of a woman . 
She turned her long , almond - shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached . 
He raised his wand , hesitating . 
Then she spoke , in a deep , hoarse voice . 
" You are very near your goal . 
The quickest way is past me . " 
" So ... so will you move , please ? " said Harry , knowing what the answer was going to be . 
" No , " she said , continuing to pace . 
" Not unless you can answer my riddle . 
He weighed his chances . 
If the riddle was too hard , he could keep silent , get away from the sphinx unharmed , and try and find an alternative route to the center . 
" Okay , " he said . 
" Can I hear the riddle ? " 
The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs , in the very middle of the path , and recited : " First think of the person who lives in disguise , Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies . 
Next , tell me what's always the last thing to mend , The middle of middle and end of the end ? 
And finally give me the sound often heard During the search for a hard - to - find word . 
Now string them together , and answer me this , Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss ? " Harry gaped at her . " Could I have it again . . . 
more slowly ? " he asked tentatively . 
She blinked at him , smiled , and repeated the poem . 
" All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn't want to kiss ? " Harry asked . 
She merely smiled her mysterious smile . 
Harry took that for a " yes . " 
Harry cast his mind around . 
He'd have to try and work out the clues . . . . 
No , that's not my guess ! 
A - a spy ? 
I ' ll come back to that . . . 
She repeated the next lines of the poem . 
" ' The last thing to mend , ' " Harry repeated . 
" Er ... no idea . . . 
could I have the last bit again ? " 
" ' The sound often heard during the search for a hard - to - find word , ' " said Harry . 
The sphinx smiled at him . 
" Spy ... er ... spy ... er ... " said Harry , pacing up and down . 
" A creature I wouldn't want to kiss . . . 
a spider ! " 
She got up , stretched her front legs , and then moved aside for him to pass . 
" Thanks ! " said Harry , and , amazed at his own brilliance , he dashed forward . 
He had to be close now , he had to be . 
... His wand was telling him he was bang on course ; as long as he didn't meet anything too horrible , he might have a chance . . . . 
Harry broke into a run . 
" Point Me ! " he whispered again to his wand , and it spun around and pointed him to the right - hand one . 
The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away . 
Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him . 
Cedric was going to get there first . 
Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup , and Harry knew he would never catch up , Cedric was much taller , had much longer legs Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left , moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own ; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it , and Cedric , his eyes on the cup , had not seen it " Cedric ! " 
Harry bellowed . 
" On your left ! " Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it , but in his haste , he tripped . 
Harry saw Cedric's wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric . 
" Stupefy ! " 
Harry yelled ; the spell hit the spider's gigantic , hairy black body , but for all the good it did , he might as well have thrown a stone at it ; the spider jerked , scuttled around , and ran at Harry instead . 
" Stupefy ! 
Impedimenta ! 
Stupefy ! " 
But it was no use - the spider was either so large , or so magical , that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it . 
Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor - sharp pincers before it was upon him . 
He was lifted into the air in its front legs ; struggling madly , he tried to kick it ; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain . 
too , but his spell had no more effect than Harry's - Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted " Expelliarmus ! " 
Without pausing to think , he aimed high at the spider's underbelly , as he had done with the skrewt , and shouted " Stupefy ! '' just as Cedric yelled the same thing . 
The two spells combined did what one alone had not : The spider keeled over sideways , flattening a nearby hedge , and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs . 
" You all right ? 
Did it fall on you ? " " No , " Harry called back , panting . 
He looked down at his leg . 
It was bleeding freely . 
He could see some sort of thick , gluey secretion from the spider's pincers on his torn robes . 
He tried to get up , but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight . 
He leaned against the hedge , gasping for breath , and looked around . 
" Take it , then , " Harry panted to Cedric . 
" Go on , take it . 
You ' re there . " 
He merely stood there , looking at Harry . 
Then he turned to stare at the cup . 
Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light . 
Cedric looked around at Harry again , who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself . 
Cedric took a deep breath . 
" You take it . 
You should win . 
" That's not how it's supposed to work , " Harry said . 
He felt angry ; his leg was very painful , he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider , and after all his efforts , Cedric had beaten him to it , just as he'd beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball . 
" The one who reaches the cup first gets the points . 
That's you . 
I'm telling you , I'm not going to win any races on this leg . " 
Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider , away from the cup , shaking his head . 
" No , " he said . 
" Stop being noble , " said Harry irritably . 
" Just take it , then we can get out of here . " 
Cedric watched Harry steadying himself , holding tight to the hedge . 
" I had help on that too , " Harry snapped , trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes . 
" You helped me with the egg - we ' re square . " 
" I had help on the egg in the first place , " said Cedric . 
" We're still square , " said Harry , testing his leg gingerly ; it shook violently as he put weight on it ; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him . 
" You should ' ve got more points on the second task , " said Cedric mulishly . 
" You stayed behind to get all the hostages . 
I should ' ve done that . " 
" I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously ! " said Harry bitterly . 
" Just take the cup ! " 
" No , " said Cedric . 
He stepped over the spider's tangled legs to join Harry , who stared at him . 
He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn't had in centuries . 
" Go on , " Cedric said . 
He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had , but his face was set , his arms were folded , he seemed decided . 
Harry looked from Cedric to the cup . 
He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup aloft , heard the roar of the crowd , saw Cho's face shining with admiration , more clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . 
and then the picture faded , and he found himself staring at Cedric's shadowy , stubborn face . 
" Both of us , " Harry said . 
" What ? " " We ' ll take it at the same time . 
It's still a Hogwarts victory . 
Cedric stared at Harry . 
He unfolded his arms . 
" You - you sure ? " " Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Yeah . . . 
we ' ve helped each other out , haven't we ? 
We both got here . 
Let's just take it together . " 
For a moment , Cedric looked as though he couldn't believe his ears ; then his face split in a grin . 
" You ' re on , " he said . 
" Come here . " 
He grabbed Harrys arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood . 
When they had reached it , they both held a hand out over one of the cup's gleaming handles . 
" On three , right ? " said Harry . 
Instantly , Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel . 
He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup ; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color , Cedric at his side . 
CHAPTER THIRTY - TWO : FLESH , BLOOD , AND BONE 
Harry felt his feet slam into the ground ; his injured leg gave way , and he fell forward ; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last . 
He raised his head . 
" Where are we ? " he said . 
Cedric shook his head . 
He got up , pulled Harry to his feet , and they looked around . 
They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely ; they had obviously traveled miles - perhaps hundreds of miles - for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone . 
They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard ; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right . 
Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside . 
Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry . 
" Nope , " said Harry . 
He was looking around the graveyard . 
It was completely silent and slightly eerie . 
" Is this supposed to be part of the task ? " " I dunno , " said Cedric . 
Harry kept looking around him . 
" Someone's coming , " he said suddenly . 
Squinting tensely through the darkness , they watched the figure drawing nearer , walking steadily toward them between the graves . 
Harry couldn't make out a face , but from the way it was walking and holding its arms , he could tell that it was carrying something . 
Whoever it was , he was short , and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face . 
And - several paces nearer , the gap between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes ? 
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric . 
They both turned back to watch the approaching figure . 
It stopped beside a towering marble headstone , only six feet from them . 
For a second . 
Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another . 
And then , without warning , Harry's scar exploded with pain . 
It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life ; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face ; his knees buckled ; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all ; his head was about to split open . 
From far away , above his head , he heard a high , cold voice say , " Kill the spare . " 
A swishing noise and a second voice , which screeched the words to the night : " Avada Kedavra ! " 
A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids , and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him ; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched , and then it diminished ; terrified of what he was about to see , he opened his stinging eyes . 
Cedric was lying spread - eagled on the ground beside him . 
He was dead . 
For a second that contained an eternity , Harry stared into Cedric's face , at his open gray eyes , blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house , at his half - open mouth , which looked slightly surprised . 
And then , before Harry's mind had accepted what he was seeing , before he could feel anything but numb disbelief , he felt himself being pulled to his feet . 
The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle , lit his wand , and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone . 
Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it . 
TOM RIDDLE The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry , tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone . 
Harry could hear shallow , fast breathing from the depths of the hood ; he struggled , and the man hit him - hit him with a hand that had a finger missing . 
And Harry realized who was under the hood . 
It was Wormtail . 
" You ! " he gasped . 
But Wormtail , who had finished conjuring the ropes , did not reply ; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords , his fingers trembling uncontrollably , rumbling over the knots . 
Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch , Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth ; then , without a word , he turned from Harry and hurried away . 
Harry couldn't make a sound , nor could he see where Wormtail had gone ; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone ; he could see only what was right in front of him . 
Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away . 
Some way beyond him , glinting in the starlight , lay the Triwizard Cup . 
Harry's wand was on the ground at Cedric's feet . 
The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by , at the foot of the grave . 
It seemed to be stirring fretfully . 
and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what was in those robes ... he didn't want that bundle opened .... 
He could hear noises at his feet . 
He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass , circling the headstone where he was tied . 
It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground . 
Then he came back within Harry's range of vision , and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave . 
It was full of what seemed to be water - Harry could hear it slopping around - and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used ; a great stone belly large enough for a full - grown man to sit in . 
The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently , as though it was trying to free itself . 
Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand . 
The large snake slithered away into the darkness . 
The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast . 
Steam was thickening , blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire . 
And Harry heard the high , cold voice again . 
" Hurry ! " 
The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now . 
It might have been encrusted with diamonds . 
" It is ready . 
Master . " 
" Now ... " said the cold voice . 
Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground , revealing what was inside them , and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth . 
It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly , slimy , and blind - but worse , a hundred times worse . 
The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child , except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child . 
Its arms and legs were thin and feeble , and its face - no child alive ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike , with gleaming red eyes . 
As he did so , his hood fell back , and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail's weak , pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron . 
For one moment , Harry saw the evil , flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion . 
And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron ; there was a hiss , and it vanished below the surface ; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud . 
Let it drown , Harry thought , his scar burning almost past endurance , please . . . 
let it drown . . . . 
He raised his wand , closed his eyes , and spoke to the night . 
The surface of the grave at Harry's feet cracked . 
Horrified , Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail's command and fell softly into the cauldron . 
The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed ; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid , poisonous - looking blue . 
And now Wormtail was whimpering . 
He pulled a long , thin , shining silver dagger from inside his cloak . 
" He stretched his right hand out in front of him - the hand with the missing finger . 
He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward . 
Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he closed his eyes as tightly as he could , but he could not block the scream that pierced the night , that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too . 
He heard something fall to the ground , heard Wormtail's anguished panting , then a sickening splash , as something was dropped into the cauldron . 
Harry couldn't stand to look . . . 
but the potion had turned a burning red ; the light of it shone through Harry's closed eyelids . . . . 
Not until Harry felt Wormtail's anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him . 
" B - blood of the enemy . . . 
you will . . . 
.. Squinting down , struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him , he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtails remaining hand . 
He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes . 
Wormtail , still panting with pain , rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry's cut , so that a dribble of blood fell into it . 
He staggered back to the cauldron with Harrys blood . 
Wormtail , his job done , dropped to his knees beside the cauldron , then slumped sideways and lay on the ground , cradling the bleeding stump of his arm , gasping and sobbing . 
Nothing happened . . . . 
Let it have drowned . 
• And then , suddenly , the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished . 
A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead , obliterating everything in front of Harry , so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air . 
... It's gone wrong , he thought . . . 
it's drowned . 
.. please . . . 
... But then , through the mist in front of him , he saw , with an icy surge of terror , the dark outline of a man , tall and skeletally thin , rising slowly from inside the cauldron . 
" Robe me , " said the high , cold voice from behind the steam , and Wormtail , sobbing and moaning , still cradling his mutilated arm , scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground , got to his feet , reached up , and pulled them onehanded over his master's head . 
The thin man stepped out of the cauldron , staring at Harry . . . 
and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years . 
Whiter than a skull , with wide , livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils . . . 
Lord Voldemort had risen again . 
Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body . 
His hands were like large , pale spiders ; his long white fingers caressed his own chest , his arms , his face ; the red eyes , whose pupils were slits , like a cats , gleamed still more brightly through the darkness . 
He held up his hands and flexed the fingers , his expression rapt and exultant . 
He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail , who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground , nor of the great snake , which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again , hissing . 
Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long - fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand . 
He caressed it gently too ; and then he raised it , and pointed it at Wormtail , who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied ; he fell to the foot of it and lay there , crumpled up and crying . 
Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now ; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them . 
you promised . . . 
" Oh Master . . . 
thank you , Master ... " He extended the bleeding stump , but Voldemort laughed again . 
" Master , please . . 
. please ... " Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm ; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow , and Harry saw something upon the skin there , something like a vivid red tattoo - a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup : the Dark Mark . 
" It is back , " he said softly , " they will all have noticed it ... and now , we shall see ... now we shall know ... " He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm . 
The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again , and Wormtail let out a fresh howl ; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark , and Harry saw that it had turned jet black . 
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face , Voldemort straightened up , threw back his head , and stared around at the dark graveyard . 
" And how many will be foolish enough to stay away ? " 
He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail , eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while . 
After a minute or so , he looked down at Harry again , a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face . 
" You stand , Harry Potter , upon the remains of my late father , " he hissed softly . 
" A Muggle and a fool . . . 
very like your dear mother . 
But they both had their uses , did they not ? 
and I killed my father , and see how useful he has proved himself , in death . 
... " Voldemort laughed again . 
Up and down he paced , looking all around him as he walked , and the snake continued to circle in the grass . 
" You see that house upon the hillside , Potter ? 
My mother , a witch who lived here in this village , fell in love with him . 
But he abandoned her when she told him what she was . 
Potter , and she died giving birth to me , leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . 
Still he paced , his red eyes darting from grave to grave . 
" Listen to me , reliving family history . . 
. " he said quietly , " why , I am growing quite sentimental . . . . 
But look , Harry ! 
The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks . 
All of them were hooded and masked . 
And one by one they moved forward . . . 
slowly , cautiously , as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence , waiting for them . 
Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees , crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes . 
Master . . . 
The Death Eaters behind him did the same ; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes , before backing away and standing up , forming a silent circle , which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave , Harry , Voldemort , and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail . 
Yet they left gaps in the circle , as though waiting for more people . 
Voldemort , however , did not seem to expect more . 
He looked around at the hooded faces , and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle , as though it had shivered . 
" Welcome , Death Eaters , " said Voldemort quietly . 
" Thirteen years . . . 
thirteen years since last we met . 
Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday , we are still united under the Dark Mark , then ! 
Or are we ? " 
He put back his terrible face and sniffed , his slit - like nostrils widening . 
" I smell guilt , " he said . 
" There is a stench or guilt upon the air . 
A second shiver ran around the circle , as though each member of it longed , but did not dare to step back from him . 
and I ask myself . . . 
No one spoke . 
No one moved except Wormtail , who was upon the ground , still sobbing over his bleeding arm . 
" And I answer myself , " whispered Voldemort , " they must have believed me broken , they thought I was gone . 
They slipped back among my enemies , and they pleaded innocence , and ignorance , and bewitchment . . . . 
They , who knew the steps I took , long ago , to guard myself against mortal death ? 
They , who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living ? 
" And I answer myself , perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist , one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . 
At the mention of Dumbledore's name , the members of the circle stirred , and some muttered and shook their heads . 
Voldemort ignored them . 
" It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed . . . 
One of the men suddenly flung himself forward , breaking the circle . 
Forgive us all ! " Voldemort began to laugh . 
He raised his wand . 
" Crucio ! " 
The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked ; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around . . . . 
anyone . 
.. anything . . . 
Voldemort raised his wand . 
The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground , gasping . 
" Get up , Avery , " said Voldemort softly . 
" Stand up . 
You ask for forgiveness ? 
I do not forgive . 
I do not forget . 
Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years ' repayment before I forgive you . 
He looked down at Wormtail , who continued to sob . 
" You returned to me , not out of loyalty , but out of fear of your old friends . 
You know that , don't you ? " " Yes , Master , " moaned Wormtail , " please . 
Master . . . 
" Worthless and traitorous as you are , you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers ... . " 
Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air . 
A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake . 
Momentarily shapeless , it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand , bright as moonlight , which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist . 
His breathing harsh and ragged , he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand , now attached seamlessly to his arm , as though he were wearing a dazzling glove . 
He flexed the shining fingers , then , trembling , picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder . 
" Master ... it is beautiful . . . 
thank you ... thank you . ... " He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes . 
" May your loyalty never waver again , Wormtail , " said Voldemort . 
" No , my Lord . . . 
Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle , staring at his powerful new hand , his face still shining with tears . 
Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right . 
" Lucius , my slippery friend , " he whispered , halting before him . 
" I am told that you have not renounced the old ways , though to the world you present a respectable face . 
You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle - torture , I believe ? 
Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun , I daresay . . . 
" Yes , I know all about that , Lucius . . . . 
You have disappointed me . 
" Of course , my Lord , of course . . . . 
You are merciful , thank you . ... " Voldemort moved on , and stopped , staring at the space - large enough for two people - that separated Malfoy and the next man . 
" The Lestranges should stand here , " said Voldemort quietly . 
" But they are entombed in Azkaban . 
They were faithful . 
The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me , and an army of creatures whom all fear . 
... " He walked on . 
Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence , but he paused before others and spoke to them . 
" Macnair . . . 
destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now , Wormtail tells me ? 
Lord Voldemort will provide . 
... " " Thank you , Master . . . 
thank you , " murmured Macnair . 
you will do better this time , will you not , Crabbe ? 
And you , Goyle ? " 
" Yes , Master ... " " We will , Master .... " " The same goes for you , Nott , " said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr . Goyles shadow . 
" My Lord , I prostrate myself before you , I am your most faithful - " " That will do , " said Voldemort . 
He had reached the largest gap of all , and he stood surveying it with his blank , red eyes , as though he could see people standing there . 
" And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . 
One , too cowardly to return ... he will pay . 
The Death Eaters stirred , and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks . 
" He is at Hogwarts , that faithful servant , and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight . . . . 
" Yes , " said Voldemort , a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction . 
There was a silence . 
Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward , and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask . 
" Master , we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . 
this miracle . . . 
how you managed to return to us . 
" Ah , what a story it is , Lucius , " said Voldemort . 
He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry , so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them . 
The snake continued to circle . 
" You know , of course , that they have called this boy my downfall ? " 
" You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body , I tried to kill him . 
His mother died in the attempt to save him - and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen . 
... I could not touch the boy . " 
Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek . 
This is old magic , I should have remembered it , I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter . 
I can touch him now . " 
Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him , and thought his head would burst with the pain . 
Voldemort laughed softly in his ear , then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters . 
" I miscalculated , my friends , I admit it . 
My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice , and it rebounded upon myself . 
I was ripped from my body , I was less than spirit , less than the meanest ghost . . . 
but still , I was alive . 
What I was , even I do not know ... I , who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality . 
You know my goal - to conquer death . 
And now , I was tested , and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed , though the curse should have done it . 
Nevertheless , I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive , and without the means to help myself ... for I had no body , and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand . . . . 
... I settled in a faraway place , in a forest , and I waited . . . . 
one of them would come and perform the magic I could not , to restore me to a body . . 
... " The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters . 
" Only one power remained to me . 
I could possess the bodies of others . 
But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful , for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me . 
and my possession of them shortened their lives ; none of them lasted long . . . . 
" Then . . . 
four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured . 
Oh , he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of ... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school ... he was easy to bend to my will ... he brought me back to this country , and after a while , I took possession of his body , to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders . 
But my plan failed . 
I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone . 
I was not to be assured immortal life . 
I was thwarted . . . 
thwarted , once again , by Harry Potter . 
... " Silence once more ; nothing was stirring , not even the leaves on the yew tree . 
" The servant died when I left his body , and I was left as weak as ever I had been , " Voldemort continued . 
" I returned to my hiding place far away , and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers . . . . 
I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . 
... " One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably , but Voldemort took no notice . 
" And then , not even a year ago , when I had almost abandoned hope , it happened at last ... a servant returned to me . 
Wormtail here , who had faked his own death to escape justice , was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends , and decided to return to his master . 
He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . 
helped , of course , by the rats he met along the way . 
His filthy little friends told him there was a place , deep in an Albanian forest , that they avoided , where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them . . . . 
" But his journey back to me was not smooth , was it , Wormtail ? 
For , hungry one night , on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me , he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . 
and who should he meet there , but one Bertha Jorkins , a witch from the Ministry of Magic . 
This might have been the end of Wormtail , and of my last hope for regeneration . 
He overpowered her ... he brought her to me . 
And Bertha Jorkins , who might have ruined all , proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for - with a little persuasion - she became a veritable mine of information . 
" She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year . 
She told me many things . . . 
but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful , and when I had extracted all useful information from her , her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair . 
I could not possess her . 
I disposed of her . " Voldemort smiled his terrible smile , his red eyes blank and pitiless . 
However , he was the able - bodied servant I needed , and , poor wizard though he is , Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him , which would return me to a rudimentary , weak body of my own , a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini , " Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake , " a potion concocted from unicorn blood , and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form , and strong enough to travel . 
" There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore , for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed . 
But I was willing to embrace mortal life again , before chasing immortality . 
I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again , and my old strength . 
" I knew that to achieve this - it is an old piece of Dark Magic , the potion that revived me tonight - I would need three powerful ingredients . 
" My father's bone , naturally , meant that we would have to come here , where he was buried . 
But I knew the one I must use , if I was to rise again , more powerful than I had been when I had fallen . 
I wanted Harry Potters blood . 
I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . 
" But how to get at Harry Potter ? 
For he has been better protected than I think even he knows , protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago , when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future . 
Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic , to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations ' care . 
Not even I can touch him there . . . . 
Then , of course , there was the Quidditch World Cup . 
... I thought his protection might be weaker there , away from his relations and Dumbledore , but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards . 
And then , the boy would return to Hogwarts , where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle - loving fool from morning until night . 
So how could I take him ? 
" Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information , of course . 
Use my one faithful Death Eater , stationed at Hogwarts , to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire . 
Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament - that he touched the Triwizard Cup first - the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey , which would bring him here , beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection , and into my waiting arms . 
... " Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry . 
He raised his wand . 
" Crucio ! " 
It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced ; his very bones were on fire ; his head was surely splitting along his scar ; his eyes were rolling madly in his head ; he wanted it to end ... to black out ... to die ... 
And then it was gone . 
He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father , looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist . 
The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters ' laughter . 
" You see , I think , how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me , " said Voldemort . 
" But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind . 
Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance . 
And I am now going to prove my power by killing him , here and now , in front of you all , when there is no Dumbledore to help him , and no mother to die for him . 
I will give him his chance . 
He will be allowed to fight , and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger . 
Just a little longer , Nagini , " he whispered , and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching . 
Wormtail approached Harry , who scrambled to find his feet , to support his own weight before the ropes were untied . 
Wormtail raised his new silver hand , pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry , and then , with one swipe , cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone . 
There was a split second , perhaps , when Harry might have considered running for it , but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave , as the Death Eaters closed ranks , forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort , so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled . 
Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body lay and returned with Harry's wand , which he thrust roughly into Harry's hand without looking at him . 
Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters . 
" You have been taught how to duel . 
Harry Potter ? " said Voldemort softly , his red eyes glinting through the darkness . 
He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse - and Voldemort was right - his mother was not here to die for him this time . 
He was quite unprotected . . . . 
" We bow to each other . 
Harry , " said Voldemort , bending a little , but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry . 
Dumbledore would like you to show manners . . . . 
Bow to death , Harry . 
... " The Death Eaters were laughing again . 
Harry did not bow . 
He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction . . . . 
" I said , bow , " Voldemort said , raising his wand - and Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge , invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward , and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever . 
" Very good , " said Voldemort softly , and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too . 
" And now you face me , like a man . . . 
straight - backed and proud , the way your father died . . . . 
" And now - we duel . " 
Voldemort raised his wand , and before Harry could do anything to defend himself , before he could even move , he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse . 
The pain was so intense , so all - consuming , that he no longer knew where he was . . . . 
Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet ; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off ; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters , and they pushed him away , back toward Voldemort . 
That hurt , didn't it . 
Harry ? 
You don't want me to do that again , do you ? " 
Harry didn't answer . 
He was going to die like Cedric , those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die , and there was nothing he could do about it ... but he wasn't going to play along . 
He wasn't going to obey Voldemort ... he wasn't going to beg . . . . 
" I asked you whether you want me to do that again , " said Voldemort softly . 
" Answer me ! 
Imperial " And Harry felt , for the third time in his life , the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought . . . . 
Ah , it was bliss , not to think , it was as though he were floating , dreaming ... just answer no ... say no ... just answer no . 
I will not , said a stronger voice , in the back of his head , I won't answer . . . . 
Just answer no . . . . 
I won't do it , I won't say it . 
... Just answer no . . . . 
" I WON ' T ! " 
And these words burst from Harry's mouth ; they echoed through the graveyard , and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him - back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body - back rushed the realization of where he was , and what he was facing . . . . 
" You won't ? " said Voldemort quietly , and the Death Eaters were not laughing now . 
" You won't say no ? Harry , obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die . . . . 
Perhaps another little dose of pain ? " Voldemort raised his wand , but this time Harry was ready ; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training , he flung himself sideways onto the ground ; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort s father , and he heard it crack as the curse missed him . 
" We are not playing hide - and - seek , Harry , " said Voldemort's soft , cold voice , drawing nearer , as the Death Eaters laughed . 
" You cannot hide from me . 
Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now , Harry ? 
Come out , Harry . . . 
come out and play , then ... it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I would not know ... 
I have never died . . . 
Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come . 
There was no hope ... no help to be had . 
And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still , he knew one thing only , and it was beyond fear or reason : He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide - and - seek ; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort s feet ... he was going to die upright like his father , and he was going to die trying to defend himself , even if no defense was possible . . . . 
Harry stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand , thrust it out in front of him , and threw himself around the headstone , facing Voldemort . 
Voldemort was ready . 
As Harry shouted , " Expelliarmus ! " Voldemort cried , " Avada Kedavra ! " 
A jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry's - they met in midair - and suddenly Harry's wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it ; his hand seized up around it ; he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to - and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands , neither red nor green , but bright , deep gold . 
And then - nothing could have prepared Harry for this - he felt his feet lift from the ground . 
He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air , their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light . 
They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves . . . . 
The Death Eaters were shouting ; they were asking Voldemort for instructions ; they were closing in , reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort , the snake slithering at their heels , some of them drawing their wands The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered ; though the wands remained connected , a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort , crisscrossing all around them , until they were enclosed in a golden , dome - shaped web , a cage of light , beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals , their cries strangely muffled now . . . . 
" Do nothing ! " Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters , and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening , saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's ; Harry held onto his wand more tightly , with both hands , and the golden thread remained unbroken . 
" Do nothing unless I command you ! " Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters . 
And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air . 
... It was coming from every thread of the light - spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort . 
It was a sound Harry recognized , though he had heard it only once before in his life : phoenix song . 
It was the sound of hope to Harry . . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life . . . . 
... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore , and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear . . . . 
I know . 
Harry told the music , I know I mustn't . . . 
and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands - Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way . . . . 
The direction of the beams movement was now toward him , from Voldemort , and he felt his wand shudder angrily . . . . 
As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip , the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame . 
The closer that bead moved , the harder Harry's wand vibrated ; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it ; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort , his ears full of phoenix song , his eyes furious , fixed . . . 
and slowly , very slowly , the beads quivered to a halt , and then , just as slowly , they began to move the other way . . . 
and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extra - hard now . . . 
One of the beads of light was quivering , inches from the tip of Voldemorts wand . 
and slowly . . . 
and then it connected . . . . 
then Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock - a dense , smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail . . . 
and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemorts wand tip , a great , grayish something , that looked as though it were made of the solidest , densest smoke . 
... It was a head . . . 
now a chest and arms . . . 
the torso of Cedric Diggory . 
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock , it would have been then , but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly , so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken , even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory ( was it a ghost ? it looked so solid ) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand , as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel . . . 
and this shade of Cedric stood up , and looked up and down the golden thread of light , and spoke . 
" Hold on . 
Harry , " it said . 
Its voice was distant and echoing . 
Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . 
and , very dimly . 
Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters , prowling around the edges of the golden dome . . 
More screams of pain from the wand . . . 
and then something else emerged from its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head , quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . 
and his ghost , or his shadow , or whatever it was , fell next to Cedric's , and surveyed Harry and Voldemort , and the golden web , and the connected wands , with mild surprise , leaning on his walking stick . . . . 
You fight him , boy . . . 
But already , yet another head was emerging ... and this head , gray as a smoky statue , was a woman's . . . . 
Harry , both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still , saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others , staring . . . . 
The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes . 
" Don't let him get you , Harry - don't let go ! " 
She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web , while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and Voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers , whispered words of encouragement to Harry , and hissed words Harry couldn't hear to Voldemort . 
And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . 
and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew , as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . 
knew , because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight . . . . 
The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done , straightened up , and looked at him . . . 
and Harry , his arms shaking madly now , looked back into the ghostly face of his father . 
. " he said quietly . 
" She wants to see you ... it will be all right .. . 
hold on . . . 
first her head , then her body ... a young woman with long hair , the smoky , shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort's wand , fell to the ground , and straightened like her husband . 
She walked close to Harry , looking down at him , and she spoke in the same distant , echoing voice as the others , but quietly , so that Voldemort , his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him , could not hear . . 
.. " When the connection is broken , we will linger for only moments . . . 
but we will give you time . . . 
you must get to the Portkey , it will return you to Hogwarts ... do you understand , Harry ? " " Yes , " Harry gasped , fighting now to keep a hold on his wand , which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers . 
" Harry . . 
. " whispered the figure of Cedric , " take my body back , will you ? 
Take my body back to my parents , ... " " I will , " said Harry , his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand . 
" Do it now , " whispered his father's voice , " be ready to run . . . 
do it now . 
Harry yelled ; he didn't think he could have held on for another moment anyway - he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench , and the golden thread broke ; the cage of light vanished , the phoenix song died - but the shadowy figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear - they were closing in upon Voldemort , shielding Harry from his gaze And Harry ran as he had never run in his life , knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed ; he zigzagged behind headstones , feeling their curses following him , hearing them hit the headstones - he was dodging curses and graves , pelting toward Cedric's body , no longer aware of the pain in his leg , his whole being concentrated on what he had to do " Stun him ! " he heard Voldemort scream . 
Ten feet from Cedric , Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it . 
Gripping his wand more tightly , he dashed out from behind the angel " Impedimenta ! " he bellowed , pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him . 
From a muffled yell , he thought he had stopped at least one of them , but there was no time to stop and look ; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him ; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell , stretching out his hand to grab Cedric's arm ... " Stand aside ! 
I will kill him ! 
He is mine ! " shrieked Voldemort . 
Harry's hand had closed on Cedric's wrist ; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort , but Cedric was too heavy to carry , and the cup was out of reach Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness . 
Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile , saw him raise his wand . 
" Accio ! " 
Harry yelled , pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup . 
Harry caught it by the handle He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked - it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color , and Cedric along with him . . . . 
They were going back . 
Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground ; his face was pressed into grass ; the smell of it filled his nostrils . 
He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him , and he kept them closed now . 
He did not move . 
All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him ; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship . 
To hold himself steady , he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching : the smooth , cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric's body . 
He felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them . 
Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground , breathing in the smell of the grass , waiting . . . 
waiting for someone to do something . . . 
something to happen . . . 
and all the while , his scar burned dully on his forehead . . . . 
" Harry ! 
Harry ! " 
He opened his eyes . 
He was looking up at the starry sky , and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over him . 
The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them , pushing nearer ; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps . 
He had come back to the edge of the maze . 
He could see the stands rising above him , the shapes of people moving in them , the stars above . 
Harry let go of the cup , but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly . 
He raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore's wrist , while Dumbledore's face swam in and out of focus . 
" He's back , " Harry whispered . 
" He's back . 
Voldemort . " 
" What's going on ? 
What's happened ? " 
" Dumbledore - he's dead ! " 
The words were repeated , the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them . . . 
and then others shouted it - screeched it - into the night " He's dead ! " " He's dead ! " " Cedric Diggory ! 
Dead ! " 
" Harry , let go of him , " he heard Fudge's voice say , and he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric's limp body , but Harry wouldn't let him go . 
Then Dumbledore's face , which was still blurred and misted , came closer . 
" Harry , you can't help him now . 
It's over . 
Let go . " " He wanted me to bring him back , " Harry muttered - it seemed important to explain this . 
" He wanted me to bring him back to his parents . 
... " " That's right . 
Harry . . . 
just let go now . . . 
Dumbledore bent down , and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin , raised Harry from the ground and set - him on his feet . 
Harry swayed . 
The crowd around them jostled , fighting to get closer , pressing darkly in on him - " What's happened ? " 
" What's wrong with him ? " 
" Diggorys dead ! " " He ' ll need to go to the hospital wing ! " Fudge was saying loudly . 
" He's ill , he's injured - Dumbledore , Diggory's parents , they ' re here , they ' re in the stands . 
... " " I ' ll take Harry , Dumbledore , I ' ll take him - " " No , I would prefer - " " Dumbledore , Amos Diggorys running . . . 
he's coming over . . . . 
come on ... hospital wing . . 
" You need to lie down . . 
.. Come on now .... " Someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling , half carrying him through the frightened crowd . 
Harry heard people gasping , screaming , and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them , taking him back to the castle . 
Across the lawn , past the lake and the Durmstrang ship , Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk . 
" What happened . 
Harry ? " the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps . 
It was Mad - Eye Moody . 
" Cup was a Portkey , " said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall . 
" Took me and Cedric to a graveyard . . . 
and Voldemort was there . . . 
Lord Voldemort ... " 
Up the marble stairs . . . 
" The Dark Lord was there ? 
What happened then ? " " Killed Cedric . . . 
. " " And then ? " 
Along the corridor . . . 
" Made a potion . . . got his body back . . . 
. " " The Dark Lord got his body back ? 
He's returned ? " 
" And the Death Eaters came . . . 
and then we dueled . 
... " " You dueled with the Dark Lord ? " " Got away . . . 
my wand . . . 
did something funny . 
... I saw my mum and dad . . . 
they came out of his wand . 
... " " In here . 
Harry ... in here , and sit down . . . . 
You ' ll be all right now . . . 
drink this . 
... " Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands . 
come on , now . 
Harry , I need to know exactly what happened . 
... " Moody helped tip the stuff down Harrys throat ; he coughed , a peppery taste burning his throat . 
He looked as white as Fudge had looked , and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry's face . 
" Voldemort's back , Harry ? 
You ' re sure he's back ? 
How did he do it ? " 
" He took stuff from his father's grave , and from Wormtail , and me , " said Harry . 
His head felt clearer ; his scar wasn't hurting so badly ; he could now see Moodys face distinctly , even though the office was dark . 
He could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant Quidditch field . 
" What did the Dark Lord take from you ? " said Moody . 
" Blood , " said Harry , raising his arm . 
Moody let out his breath in a long , low hiss . 
" And the Death Eaters ? 
They returned ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Loads of them . . 
. " " How did he treat them ? " 
Moody asked quietly . 
" Did he forgive them ? " 
But Harry had suddenly remembered . 
He should have told Dumbledore , he should have said it straightaway " There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts ! 
There's a Death Eater here - they put my name in the Goblet of Fire , they made sure I got through to the end - " Harry tried to get up , but Moody pushed him back down . 
" I know who the Death Eater is , " he said quietly . 
" Karkaroff ? " said Harry wildly . 
" Where is he ? 
Have you got him ? 
" Karkaroff fled tonight , when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm . 
He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . 
" Karkaroff's gone ? 
But then - he didn't put my name in the goblet ? " 
" No , " said Moody slowly . 
" No , he didn't . 
It was I who did that . " 
Harry heard , but didn't believe . 
" No , you didn't , " he said . 
" You didn't do that . . . 
you can't have done ... " " I assure you I did , " said Moody , and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door , and Harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it . 
At the same time , Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry . 
" He forgave them , then ? " he said . 
" The Death Eaters who went free ? 
The ones who escaped Azkaban ? " " What ? " said Harry . 
He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him . 
This was a bad joke , it had to be . 
The faithless , worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup , but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky . " " You fired . . . 
What are you talking about . . . 
? " " I told you . 
Harry ... I told you . 
They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most . 
I expected him to punish them . 
I expected him to torture them . 
Tell me he hurt them , Harry . . . 
Moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile . 
" Tell me he told them that I , I alone remained faithful ... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all ... you " " You didn't ... it - it can't be you . 
... " " Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire , under the name of a different school ? 
I did . 
Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament ? 
I did . 
Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons ? 
I did . 
Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon ? 
I did " Moody's magical eye had now left the door . 
It was fixed upon Harry . 
" It hasn't been easy , Harry , guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion . 
I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess , so that my hand would not be detectable in your success . 
Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily . 
that was when I was most afraid we would fail . 
I was keeping watch on you , Potter . 
I knew you hadn't worked out the egg's clue , so I had to give you another hint - " " You didn't , " Harry said hoarsely . 
I did . 
I trusted that he would pass the information on to you . 
I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons , and so he did . 
But even then , Potter , even then you seemed likely to fail . 
I was watching all the time ... all those hours in the library . 
Didn't you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along ? 
I planted it there early on , I gave it to the Longbottom boy , don't you remember ? 
Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean . 
It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed . 
I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help . 
But you did not . . . 
you did not . . . . 
" So what could I do ? 
You told me at the Yule Ball a house - elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas present . 
I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning . 
I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken , and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed . 
And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape's office and then hurried to find you ... " Moodys wand was still pointing directly at Harry's heart . 
Over his shoulder , foggy shapes were moving in the Foe - Glass on the wall . 
" You were so long in that lake , Potter , I thought you had drowned . 
I breathed again . 
I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed . 
I put the Imperius Curse on Krum , so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear . " 
Harry stared at Moody . 
... Dumbledore's friend , the famous Auror . . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters ... It made no sense ... no sense at all . 
Harry could see the outlines of three people over Moody's shoulder , moving closer and closer . 
But Moody wasn't watching them . 
His magical eye was upon Harry . 
" The Dark Lord didn't manage to kill you . 
Potter , and he so wanted to , " whispered Moody . 
I gave you to him - the thing he needed above all to regenerate - and then I killed you for him . 
I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters . 
I will be his dearest , his closest supporter . . . 
... " Moody's normal eye was bulging , the magical eye fixed upon Harry . 
The door was barred , and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time . . . . 
" The Dark Lord and I , " said Moody , and he looked completely insane now , towering over Harry , leering down at him , " have much in common . 
Both of us suffered the indignity , Harry , of being named after those fathers . 
And both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order ! " " You ' re mad , " Harry said - he couldn't stop himself - " you ' re mad ! " " Mad , am I ? " said Moody , his voice rising uncontrollably . 
He is back , Harry Potter , you did not conquer him - and now - I conquer you ! " Moody raised his wand , he opened his mouth ; Harry plunged his own hand into his robes " Stupefy ! " 
There was a blinding flash of red light , and with a great splintering and crashing , the door of Moody's office was blasted apart Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor . 
Harry , still staring at the place where Moody's face had been , saw Albus Dumbledore , Professor Snape , and 
Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe - Glass . 
He looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway , Dumbledore in front , his wand outstretched . 
At that moment , Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared . 
The look upon Dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad - Eye Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined . 
There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore's face , no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles . 
There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face ; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat . 
He stepped into the office , placed a foot underneath Moodys unconscious body , and kicked him over onto his back , so that his face was visible . 
Snape followed him , looking into the Foe - Glass , where his own face was still visible , glaring into the room . 
Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry . 
The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry . 
" Come along . . . 
hospital wing ... " " No , " said Dumbledore sharply . 
" Dumbledore , he ought to - look at him - he's been through enough tonight - " " He will stay , Minerva , because he needs to understand , " said Dumbledore curtly . 
" Understanding is the first step to acceptance , and only with acceptance can there be recovery . 
He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight , and why , " " Moody , " Harry said . 
He was still in a state of complete disbelief . 
" How can it have been Moody ? " " This is not Alastor Moody , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" You have never known Alastor Moody . 
The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight . 
The moment he took you , I knew - and I followed . " 
Dumbledore bent down over Moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes . 
He pulled out Moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring . 
Then he turned to Professors McGonagall and Snape . 
" Severus , please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess , and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house - elf called Winky . 
Minerva , kindly go down to Hagrid's house , where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch . 
Take the dog up to my office , tell him I will be with him shortly , then come back here . " 
Both turned at once and left the office . 
Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks , fitted the first key in the lock , and opened it . 
It contained a mass of spell - books . 
Dumbledore closed the trunk , placed a second key in the second lock , and opened the trunk again . 
Harry watched , astounded , as Dumbledore placed the third , fourth , fifth , and sixth keys in their respective locks , reopening the trunk each time , and revealing different contents each time . 
Then he placed the seventh key in the lock , threw open the lid , and Harry let out a cry of amazement . 
He was looking down into a kind of pit , an underground room , and lying on the floor some ten feet below , apparently fast asleep , thin and starved in appearance , was the real Mad - Eye Moody . 
His wooden leg was gone , the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid , and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing . 
Harry stared , thunderstruck , between the sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office . 
Dumbledore climbed into the trunk , lowered himself , and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody . 
He bent over him . 
Harry , throw down the imposter's cloak - he's freezing . 
Madam Pomfrey will need to see him , but he seems in no immediate danger . " 
Harry did as he was told ; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak , tucked it around him , and clambered out of the trunk again . 
Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk , unscrewed it , and turned it over . 
A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor . 
" Polyjuice Potion , Harry , " said Dumbledore . " You see the simplicity of it , and the brilliance . 
The imposter needed , of course , to keep the real Moody close by , so that he could continue making the potion . 
You see his hair ... " Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk . 
" The imposter has been cutting it off all year , see where it is uneven ? 
But I think , in the excitement of tonight , our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done ... on the hour . . . 
We shall see . " 
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it , his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor . 
Harry stared at him too . 
Minutes passed in silence ... . 
Then , before Harry's very eyes , the face of the man on the floor began to change . 
The scars were disappearing , the skin was becoming smooth ; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink . 
The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw . 
Suddenly , with a loud clunk , the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place ; next moment , the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it ; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction . 
Harry saw a man lying before him , pale - skinned , slightly freckled , with a mop of fair hair . 
He knew who he was . 
He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve , had watched him being led away from court by the dementors , trying to convince Mr . Crouch that he was innocent . . . 
but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older . . . . 
Snape had returned with Winky at his heels . 
Professor McGonagall was right behind them . 
" Crouch ! " Snape said , stopping dead in the doorway . 
" Barty Crouch ! " " Good heavens , " said Professor McGonagall , stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor . 
Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek . 
" Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you doing here ? " 
" You is killed him ! 
You is killed him ! 
Severus , you have the potion ? " 
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid : the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class . 
Dumbledore got up , bent over the man on the floor , and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe - Glass , in which the reflections of Dumbledore , Snape , and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all . 
Winky remained on her knees , trembling , her hands over her face . 
Dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it . 
Then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said , " Ennervate . " 
Crouch's son opened his eyes . 
His face was slack , his gaze unfocused . 
Dumbledore knelt before him , so that their faces were level . 
" Can you hear me ? " Dumbledore asked quietly . 
The man's eyelids flickered . 
" Yes , " he muttered . 
" I would like you to tell us , " said Dumbledore softly , " how you came to be here . 
How did you escape from Azkaban ? " Crouch took a deep , shuddering breath , then began to speak in a flat , expressionless voice . 
" My mother saved me . 
She knew she was dying . 
She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her . 
He loved her as he had never loved me . 
He agreed . 
They came to visit me . 
They gave me a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother's hairs . 
We took on each other's appearance . " 
Winky was shaking her head , trembling . 
" Say no more . 
But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice . 
" The dementors are blind . 
They sensed one healthy , one dying person entering Azkaban . 
" My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban . 
She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance . 
The man's eyelids flickered . 
" And what did your father do with you , when he had got you home ? " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Staged my mother's death . 
A quiet , private funeral . 
That grave is empty . 
Then I had to be concealed . 
I had to be controlled . 
My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me . 
When I had recovered my strength , I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his service . " 
" How did your father subdue you ? " said Dumbledore . " The Imperius Curse , " Moody said . 
" I was under my fathers control . 
I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night . 
I was always with the house - elf . 
She was my keeper and caretaker . 
She pitied me . 
She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats . 
... " " Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive ? " said Dumbledore softly . 
" Yes , " said Crouch , his eyelids flickering again . 
" A witch in my father's office . 
Bertha Jorkins . 
She came to the house with papers for my father s signature . 
He was not at home . 
Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen , to me . 
But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me . 
She came to investigate . 
She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak . 
My father arrived home . 
He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she'd found out . 
Too powerful . 
He said it damaged her memory permanently . " 
sobbed Winky . 
" Why isn't she leaving us be ? " " Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup , " said Dumbledore . " Winky talked my father into it , " said Crouch , still in the same monotonous voice . 
I had loved Quidditch . 
Let him go , she said . 
He can watch . 
She said my mother would have wanted it . 
She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom . 
He agreed in the end . 
" It was carefully planned . 
My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day . 
Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father . 
I was to sit there , invisible . 
When everyone had left the box , we would emerge . 
Winky would appear to be alone . 
" But Winky didn't know that I was growing stronger . 
I was starting to fight my father's Imperius Curse . 
There were times when I was almost myself again . 
It was like waking from a deep sleep . 
I found myself out in public , in the middle of the match , and I saw , in front of me , a wand sticking out of a boys pocket . 
I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban . 
I stole it . 
Winky didn't know . 
Winky is frightened of heights . 
She had her face hidden . " 
" So you took the wand , " said Dumbledore , " and what did you do with it ? " 
" We went back to the tent , " said Crouch . 
" Then we heard them . 
We heard the Death Eaters . 
They were not enslaved , as I was . 
They were free to seek him , but they did not . 
My mind was clearer than it had been in years . 
I was angry . 
I had the wand . 
I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master . 
My father had left the tent ; he had gone to free the Muggles . 
Winky was afraid to see me so angry . 
She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her . 
She pulled me from the tent , pulled me into the forest , away from the Death Eaters . 
I tried to hold her back . 
I wanted to return to the campsite . 
I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant , and to punish them for their lack of it . 
I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky . 
They shot Stunning Spells everywhere . 
One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood . 
We were both Stunned . 
He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there . 
He waited until the other Ministry members had left the forest . 
He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home . 
He dismissed Winky . 
She had almost let me escape . " 
Winky let out a wail of despair . 
" Now it was just Father and I , alone in the house . 
And then . . . 
and then . . 
Crouch's head rolled on his neck , and an insane grin spread across his face . 
" My master came for me . 
" He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail . 
My master had found out that I was still alive . 
He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania . 
He had tortured her . 
She told him a great deal . 
She told him about the Triwizard Tournament . 
She told him the old Auror , Moody , was going to teach at Hogwarts . 
He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her . 
She told him I had escaped from Azkaban . 
She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master . 
And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant - perhaps the most faithful of all . 
My master conceived a plan , based upon the information Bertha had given him . 
He needed me . 
He arrived at our house near midnight . 
My father answered the door . " 
The smile spread wider over Crouch's face , as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life . 
Winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers . 
She seemed too appalled to speak . 
" It was very quick . 
My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master . 
Now my father was the one imprisoned , controlled . 
My master forced him to go about his business as usual , to act as though nothing was wrong . 
And I was released . 
I awoke . 
I was myself again , alive as I hadn't been in years . 
" And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do ? " said Dumbledore . " He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him . 
I was ready . 
It was my dream , my greatest ambition , to serve him , to prove myself to him . 
He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts . 
A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so . 
Turn the cup into a Portkey , which would take the first person to touch it to my master . 
But first - " " You needed Alastor Moody , " said Dumbledore . 
His blue eyes were blazing , though his voice remained calm . 
" Wormtail and I did it . 
We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand . 
There was a commotion . 
We managed to subdue him just in time . 
Took some of his hair and added it to the potion . 
I drank it ; I became Moody's double . 
I took his leg and his eye . 
I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance . 
I made the dustbins move around the yard . 
I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard , who had set off the dustbins . 
I wanted to be able to question him . 
To find out about his past , learn his habits , so that I could fool even Dumbledore . 
I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion . 
I stole boom - slang skin from the dungeons . 
When the Potions master found me in his office , I said I was under orders to search it . " 
" And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody ? " said Dumbledore . " Wormtail returned to care for my master , in my father's house , and to keep watch over my father . " 
" But your father escaped , " said Dumbledore . " Yes . 
After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done . 
There were periods when he knew what was happening . 
My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house . 
He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead . 
He made him write and say he was ill . 
He was not watchful enough . 
My father escaped . 
My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything , to confess . 
He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban . 
" My master sent me word of my father's escape . 
He told me to stop him at all costs . 
So I waited and watched . 
I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter . 
The map that had almost ruined everything . " 
" Map ? " said Dumbledore quickly . 
" What map is this ? " " Potter's map of Hogwarts . 
Potter saw me on it . 
Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's office one night . 
He thought I was my father . 
We have the same first name . 
I took the map from Potter that night . 
I told him my father hated Dark wizards . 
Potter believed my father was after Snape . 
" For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts . 
At last , one evening , the map showed my father entering the grounds . 
I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him . 
He was walking around the edge of the forest . 
Then Potter came , and Krum . 
I waited . 
I could not hurt Potter ; my master needed him . 
Potter ran to get Dumbledore . 
I Stunned Krum . 
I killed my father . " 
" Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you saying ? " 
" You killed your father , " Dumbledore said , in the same soft voice . 
" What did you do with the body ? " " Carried it into the forest . 
Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak . 
I had the map with me . 
I watched Potter run into the castle . 
He met Snape . 
Dumbledore joined them . 
I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle . 
I walked back out of the forest , doubled around behind them , went to meet them . 
I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come . 
" Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father . 
I went back to my father's body . 
Watched the map . 
When everyone was gone , I Transfigured my father's body . 
He became a bone ... I buried it , while wearing the Invisibility Cloak , in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid's cabin . " 
Then Dumbledore said , " And tonight . . 
. " " I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner , " whispered Barty Crouch . 
" Turned it into a Portkey . 
He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards . " 
The insane smile lit his features once more , and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side . 
CHAPTER THIRTY - SIX : THE PARTING OF THE WAYS 
Dumbledore stood up . 
He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face . 
Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it , ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch , binding him tightly . 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
" Minerva , could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs ? " " Of course , " said Professor McGonagall . 
However , when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch , her hand was quite steady . 
" Severus " - Dumbledore turned to Snape - " please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here ; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing . 
Then go down into the grounds , find Cornelius Fudge , and bring him up to this office . 
He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself . 
Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me . " 
Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room . 
" Harry ? " 
Dumbledore said gently . 
Harry got up and swayed again ; the pain in his leg , which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch , now returned in full measure . 
He also realized that he was shaking . 
Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor . 
" I want you to come up to my office first . 
Harry , " he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway . 
" Sirius is waiting for us there . " 
Harry nodded . 
A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him , but he did not care ; he was even glad of it . 
He didn't want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup . 
He didn't want to have to examine the memories , fresh and sharp as photographs , which kept flashing across his mind . 
Wormtail , slumped on the ground , cradling his stump of an arm . 
Voldemort , rising from the steaming cauldron . 
Cedric . . . 
dead . . . 
Cedric , asking to be returned to his parents . . . . 
" Professor , " Harry mumbled , " where are Mr . and Mrs . Diggory ? " " They are with Professor Sprout , " said Dumbledore . 
His voice , which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch , shook very slightly for the first time . 
They had reached the stone gargoyle . 
Dumbledore gave the password , it sprang aside , and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door . 
Dumbledore pushed it open . 
Sirius was standing there . 
His face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban . 
" Harry , are you all right ? 
I knew it - I knew something like this - what happened ? " 
His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk . 
" What happened ? " he asked more urgently . 
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said . 
Harry was only half listening . 
So tired every bone in his body was aching , he wanted nothing more than to sit here , undisturbed , for hours and hours , until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore . 
There was a soft rush of wings . 
Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch , flown across the office , and landed on Harry's knee . 
" ' Lo , Fawkes , " said Harry quietly . 
He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet - andgold plumage . 
Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him . 
Dumbledore stopped talking . 
He sat down opposite Harry , behind his desk . 
He was looking at Harry , who avoided his eyes . 
Dumbledore was going to question him . 
He was going to make Harry relive everything . 
" I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze . 
Harry , " said Dumbledore . " We can leave that till morning , can't we , Dumbledore ? " said Sirius harshly . 
He had put a hand on Harrys shoulder . 
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius , but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius's words . 
He leaned forward toward Harry . 
Very unwillingly , Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes . 
" If I thought I could help you , " Dumbledore said gently , " by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight , I would do it . 
But I know better . 
Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it . 
You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you . 
I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time . 
I ask you to tell us what happened . " 
It shivered in the air , and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach , warming him , and strengthening him . 
He took a deep breath and began to tell them . 
As he spoke , visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes ; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort ; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them ; he saw Cedric's body , lying on the ground beside the cup . 
Once or twice , Sirius made a noise as though about to say something , his hand still tight on Harry's shoulder , but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him , and Harry was glad of this , because it was easier to keep going now he had started . 
It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking , yet he sensed that once he had finished , he would feel better . 
When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger , however , Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started . 
Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm . 
Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them . 
" He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's , " Harry told Dumbledore . 
" He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too . 
And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself , he touched my face . " 
For a fleeting instant , Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes . 
Harry was sure he had imagined it , for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk , he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him . 
" Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier . 
Harry , continue , please . " 
Harry went on ; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron , and told them all he could remember of Voldemort's speech to the Death Eaters . 
Then he told how Voldemort had untied him , returned his wand to him , and prepared to duel . 
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort's wands , he found his throat obstructed . 
He tried to keep talking , but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort's wand were flooding into his mind . 
his mother . . . 
He was glad when Sirius broke the silence . 
" The wands connected ? " he said , looking from Harry to Dumbledore . 
" Why ? " 
Harry looked up at Dumbledore again , on whose face there was an arrested look . 
" The Reverse Spell effect ? " said Sirius sharply . 
" Exactly , " said Dumbledore . " Harry's wand and Voldemorts wand share cores . 
Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix . 
This phoenix , in fact , " he added , and he pointed at the scarlet - and - gold bird , perching peacefully on Harry's knee . 
" Yes , " said Dumbledore . " Mr . 
Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand , the moment you left his shop four years ago . " 
" So what happens when a wand meets its brother ? " said Sirius . 
" They will not work properly against each other , " said Dumbledore . " If , however , the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place . 
One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed in reverse . 
and then those which preceded it . . . 
He looked interrogatively at Harry , and Harry nodded . 
" Which means , " said Dumbledore slowly , his eyes upon Harry's face , " that some form of Cedric must have reappeared . " 
Harry nodded again . 
" Diggory came back to life ? " said Sirius sharply . 
" No spell can reawaken the dead , " said Dumbledore heavily . 
A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . 
am I correct , Harry ? " " He spoke to me , " Harry said . 
He was suddenly shaking again . 
" The . . . the ghost Cedric , or whatever he was , spoke . " 
" Bertha Jorkins . 
And . . 
. " " Your parents ? " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
Sirius's grip on Harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful . 
" The last murders the wand performed , " said Dumbledore , nodding . 
" In reverse order . 
.. what did they do ? " 
Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web , how Voldemort had seemed to fear them , how the shadow of Harry's mother had told him what to do , how Cedric's had made its final request . 
Harry found he could not continue . 
He looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands . 
Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee . 
The phoenix had fluttered to the floor . 
It was resting its beautiful head against Harry's injured leg , and thick , pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider . 
The pain vanished . 
" I will say it again , " said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door . 
" You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight . 
Harry . 
You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers . 
You have shouldered a grown wizard's burden and found yourself equal to it - and you have now given us all we have a right to expect . 
You will come with me to the hospital wing . 
I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight . 
Sirius , would you like to stay with him ? " 
Sirius nodded and stood up . 
He transformed back into the great black dog and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office , accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing . 
When Dumbledore pushed open the door . 
Harry saw Mrs . Weasley , Bill , Ron , and Hermione grouped around a harassed - looking Madam Pomfrey . 
They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him . 
All of them whipped around as Harry , Dumbledore , and the black dog entered , and Mrs . Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream . 
" Harry ! 
Oh Harry ! " 
" Molly , " he said , holding up a hand , " please listen to me for a moment . 
What he needs now is sleep , and peace , and quiet . 
If he would like you all to stay with him , " he added , looking around at Ron , Hermione , and Bill too , " you may do so . 
But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer , and certainly not this evening . " 
Mrs . Weasley nodded . 
She was very white . 
She rounded on Ron , Hermione , and Bill as though they were being noisy , and hissed , " Did you hear ? 
" may I ask what - ? " " This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while , " said Dumbledore simply . 
" I assure you , he is extremely well trained . 
Harry - I will wait while you get into bed . " 
Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others not to question him . 
It wasn't as though he didn't want them there ; but the thought of explaining it all over again , the idea of reliving it one more time , was more than he could stand . 
" I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge , Harry , " said Dumbledore . " I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school . " 
He left . 
As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed , he caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room . 
His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table . 
" Is he okay ? " 
Harry asked . 
He took off his robes , pulled on the pajamas , and got into bed . 
Ron , Hermione , Bill , Mrs . Weasley , and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him . 
Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously , as though scared of him . 
" Just tired . " 
Mrs . Weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed - covers unnecessarily . 
Madam Pomfrey , who had bustled off to her office , returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet . 
" You ' ll need to drink all of this . 
Harry , " she said . 
" It's a potion for dreamless sleep . " 
Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls . 
Everything around him became hazy ; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed ; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress . 
Harry woke up , so warm , so very sleepy , that he didn't open his eyes , wanting to drop off again . 
The room was still dimly lit ; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn't have been asleep very long . 
Then he heard whispering around him . 
" They ' ll wake him if they don't shut up ! " " What are they shouting about ? 
Harry opened his eyes blearily . 
Someone had removed his glasses . 
He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs . Weasley and Bill close by . 
Mrs . Weasley was on her feet . 
" That's Fudge's voice , " she whispered . 
" And that's Minerva McGonagall's , isn't it ? 
But what are they arguing about ? " 
" You should never have brought it inside the castle ! " yelled Professor McGonagall . 
" When Dumbledore finds out - " Harry heard the hospital doors burst open . 
Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed , all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens , Harry sat up and put his glasses back on . 
" Where's Dumbledore ? " Fudge demanded of Mrs . Weasley . 
" He's not here , " said Mrs . Weasley angrily . 
" This is a hospital wing . 
Minister , don't you think you'd do better to - " But the door opened , and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward . 
" What has happened ? " said Dumbledore sharply , looking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall . 
" Why are you disturbing these people ? 
Minerva , I'm surprised at you - I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch - " " There is no need to stand guard over him anymore , Dumble - dore ! " she shrieked . 
" The Minister has seen to that ! " Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this . 
There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks , and a hands were balled into fists ; she was trembling with fury . " When we told Mr . Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight's events , " said Snape , in a low voice ; he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question . 
He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle . 
He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch - " " I told him you would not agree , Dumbledore ! " McGonagall fumed . 
" I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle , but - " 
He did not need her to finish her sentence . 
He knew what the dementor must have done . 
It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch . 
It had sucked his soul out through his mouth . 
He was worse than dead . 
blustered Fudge . 
" But he cannot now give testimony , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore . 
He was staring hard at Fudge , as though seeing him plainly for the first time . 
" He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people . " 
" Why he killed them ? 
Well , that's no mystery , is it ? " 
blustered Fudge . 
" He was a raving lunatic ! 
From what Minerva and Severus have told me , he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You - Know - Who's instructions ! " 
" Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions , Cornelius , " Dumbledore said . 
The plan succeeded . 
Voldemort has been restored to his body . " 
Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face . 
Dazed and blinking , he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn't quite believe what he had just heard . 
He began to sputter , still goggling at Dumbledore . 
" You - Know - Who . . . 
returned ? 
Come now , Dumbledore ... " " As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you , " said Dumbledore , " we heard Barty Crouch confess . 
Under the influence of Veritaserum , he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban , and how Voldemort - learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins - went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry . 
The plan worked , I tell you . 
Crouch has helped Voldemort to return . " 
Come now , come now . . . 
certainly , Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You - Know - Who's orders - but to take the word of a lunatic like that , Dumbledore ... " " When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight , he was transported straight to Voldemort , " said Dumbledore steadily . 
" He witnessed Lord Voldemort's rebirth . 
I 
will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office . " 
Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake , but shook his head and said , " I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight . " Fudge's curious smile lingered . 
He too glanced at Harry , then looked back at Dumbledore , and said , " You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this , are you , Dumbledore ? " 
There was a moment's silence , which was broken by Sirius growling . 
His hackles were raised , and he was baring his teeth at Fudge . 
" Certainly , I believe Harry , " said Dumbledore . 
His eyes were blazing now . 
" I heard Crouch's confession , and I heard Harry's account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup ; the two stories make sense , they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer . " 
Fudge still had that strange smile on his face . 
Once again , he glanced at Harry before answering . 
" You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , on the word of a lunatic murderer , and a boy who . . . 
well ... " Fudge shot Harry another look , and Harry suddenly understood . 
" You ' ve been reading Rita Skeeter , Mr . Fudge , " he said quietly . 
Ron , Hermione , Mrs . Weasley , and Bill all jumped . 
None of them had realized that Harry was awake . 
" And if I have ? " he said , looking at Dumbledore . 
And having funny turns all over the place - " " I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar ? " said Dumbledore coolly . 
Possibly - hallucinations ? " " Listen to me , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore , taking a step toward Fudge , and once again , he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch . 
" Harry is as sane as you or I . 
I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by , or feeling particularly murderous . " 
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore , but he looked no less stubborn . 
" You ' ll forgive me , Dumbledore , but I ' ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before . 
... " " Look , I saw Voldemort come back ! " 
Harry shouted . 
He tried to get out of bed again , but Mrs . Weasley forced him back . 
" I saw the Death Eaters ! 
I can give you their names ! 
Lucius Malfoy - " Snape made a sudden movement , but as Harry looked at him , Snape's eyes flew back to Fudge . 
" Malfoy was cleared ! " said Fudge , visibly affronted . 
Harry continued . 
Now working for the Ministry ! " 
" Avery - Nott - Crabbe - Goyle - " " You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago ! " said Fudge angrily . 
" You could have found those names in old reports of the trials ! 
For heavens sake , Dumbledore - the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too - his tales are getting taller , and you ' re still swallowing them - the boy can talk to snakes . 
Dumbledore , and you still think he's trustworthy ? " 
" You fool ! " Professor McGonagall cried . 
" Cedric Diggory ! 
Mr . Crouch ! 
These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic ! " " I see no evidence to the contrary ! " 
" It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years ! " 
Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing . 
He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure , a little blustering , a little pompous , but essentially good - natured . 
But now a short , angry wizard stood before him , refusing , point - blank , to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to believe that Voldemort could have risen . 
" Voldemort has returned , " Dumbledore repeated . 
Fudge , and take the necessary measures , we may still be able to save the situation . 
The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors - " " Preposterous ! " shouted Fudge again . 
" Remove the dementors ? 
I'd be kicked out of office for suggesting it ! 
Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban ! " " The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds , Cornelius , knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them ! " said Dumbledore . " They will not remain loyal to you , Fudge ! 
Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can ! 
With the dementors behind him , and his old supporters returned to him , you will be hard - pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago ! " Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage . 
" The second step you must take - and at once , " Dumbledore pressed on , " is to send envoys to the giants . " 
" Envoys to the giants ? " 
" What madness is this ? " " Extend them the hand of friendship , now , before it is too late , " said Dumbledore , " or Voldemort will persuade them , as he did before , that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom ! " 
Fudge gasped , shaking his head and retreating further from Dumbledore . 
" If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants - people hate them , Dumbledore - end of my career - " " You are blinded , " said Dumbledore , his voice rising now , the aura of power around him palpable , his eyes blazing once more , " by the love of the office you hold , Cornelius ! 
You place too much importance , and you always have done , on the so - called purity of blood ! 
You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born , but what they grow to be ! 
Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure - blood family as old as any - and see what that man chose to make of his life ! 
I tell you now - take the steps I have suggested , and you will be remembered , in office or out , as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known . 
Fail to act - and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild ! " " Insane , " whispered Fudge , still backing away . 
And then there was silence . 
Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of Harry's bed , her hands over her mouth . 
Mrs . Weasley was still standing over Harry , her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising . 
Bill , Ron , and Hermione were staring at Fudge . 
You must act as you see fit . 
And I - I shall act as I see fit . " Dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat ; it sounded like a mere statement , but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand . 
I ' ve had a lot of respect for you . 
I might not have agreed with some of your decisions , but I ' ve kept quiet . 
There aren't many who'd have let you hire werewolves , or keep Hagrid , or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry . 
But if you ' re going to work against me - " " The only one against whom I intend to work , " said Dumbledore , " is Lord Voldemort . 
If you are against him , then we remain , Cornelius , on the same side . " 
It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this . 
He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands . 
Finally , he said , with a hint of a plea in his voice , " He can't be back , Dumbledore , he just can't be ... " Snape strode forward , past Dumbledore , pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went . 
He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge , who recoiled . 
" There , " said Snape harshly . 
" There . 
The Dark Mark . 
It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago , when it burned black , but you can still see it . 
Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord . 
When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater , we were to Disapparate , and Apparate , instantly , at his side . 
Karkaroff s too . 
Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight ? 
We both felt the Mark burn . 
We both knew he had returned . 
Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance . 
He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold . " 
Fudge stepped back from Snape too . 
He was shaking his head . 
He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said . 
He stared , apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape's arm , then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered , " I don't know what you and your staff are playing at , Dumbledore , but I have heard enough . 
I have no more to add . 
I will be in touch with you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the running of this school . 
I must return to the Ministry . " 
He turned around , strode back down the dormitory , and stopped at Harry's bed . 
" Your winnings , " he said shortly , taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harrys bedside table . 
" One thousand Galleons . 
He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room , slamming the door behind him . 
The moment he had disappeared , Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry's bed . 
" There is work to be done , " he said . 
" Molly ... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur ? " " Of course you can , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
She was white to the lips , but she looked resolute . 
" We know what Fudge is . 
It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years . 
Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride . " 
" Then I need to send a message to Arthur , " said Dumbledore . " All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately , and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius . " 
" I ' ll go to Dad , " said Bill , standing up . 
" I ' ll go now . " 
" Excellent , " said Dumbledore . " Tell him what has happened . 
He will need to be discreet , however . 
He clapped a hand on Harry's shoulder , kissed his mother on the cheek , pulled on his cloak , and strode quickly from the room . 
" Minerva , " said Dumbledore , turning to Professor McGonagall , " I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible . 
Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word . 
" Poppy , " Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey , " would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moodys office , where I think you will find a house - elf called Winky in considerable distress ? 
Do what you can for her , and take her back to the kitchens . 
I think Dobby will look after her for us . " 
Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed , and that Madam Pomfrey's footsteps had died away , before he spoke again . 
" And now , " he said , " it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are . 
The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore , then , in an instant , turned back into a man . 
Mrs . Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed . 
" Sirius Black ! " she shrieked , pointing at him . 
" Mum , shut up ! " Ron yelled . 
" What is he doing here ? " 
I trust you both . 
It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other . " 
Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle . 
" I will settle , in the short term , " said Dumbledore , with a bite of impatience in his voice , " for a lack of open hostility . 
You will shake hands . 
You are on the same side now . 
Time is short , and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united , there is no hope for any us . 
Very slowly - but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill - Sirius and Snape moved toward each other and shook hands . 
They let go extremely quickly . 
" Now I have work for each of you . 
Fudge's attitude , though not unexpected , changes everything . 
Sirius , I need you to set off at once . 
You are to alert Remus Lupin , Arabella Figg , Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd . 
" But - " said Harry . 
He wanted Sirius to stay . 
He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly . 
" You ' ll see me very soon . 
Harry , " said Sirius , turning to him . 
" I promise you . 
But I must do what I can , you understand , don't you ? " " Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Yeah . . . of course I do . " 
Sirius grasped his hand briefly , nodded to Dumbledore , transformed again into the black dog , and ran the length of the room to the door , whose handle he turned with a paw . 
Then he was gone . 
" Severus , " said Dumbledore , turning to Snape , " you know what I must ask you to do . 
If you are ready . . . 
if you are prepared ... " " I am , " said Snape . 
He looked slightly paler than usual , and his cold , black eyes glittered strangely . 
" Then good luck , " said Dumbledore , and he watched , with a trace of apprehension on his face , as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius . 
It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again . 
" I must go downstairs , " he said finally . 
" I must see the Diggorys . 
Harry - take the rest of your potion . 
I will see all of you later . " 
Hermione , Ron , and Mrs . Weasley were all looking at him . 
None of them spoke for a very long time . 
" You ' ve got to take the rest of your potion . 
Harry , " Mrs . Weasley said at last . 
Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet . 
" You have a good long sleep . 
think about what you ' re going to buy with your winnings ! " 
" I don't want that gold , " said Harry in an expressionless voice . 
" You have it . 
Anyone can have it . 
I shouldn't have won it . 
It should ' ve been Cedric's . " 
The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him . 
He could feel a burning , prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes . 
He blinked and stared up at the ceiling . 
Harry , " Mrs . Weasley whispered . 
" I told him to take the cup with me , " said Harry . 
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too . 
Mrs . Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet , bent down , and put her arms around Harry . 
The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs . Weasley held him to her . 
His mother s face , his father's voice , the sight of Cedric , dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it , until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him . 
There was a loud slamming noise , and Mrs . Weasley and Harry broke apart . 
Hermione was standing by the window . 
She was holding something tight in her hand . 
" Sorry , " she whispered . 
" Your potion , Harry , " said Mrs . Weasley quickly , wiping her eyes on the back of her hand . 
Harry drank it in one gulp . 
The effect was instantaneous . 
The worst , perhaps , was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following morning . 
They did not blame him for what had happened ; on the contrary , both thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them . 
Mr . Diggory sobbed through most of the interview . 
Mrs . Diggory's grief seemed to be beyond tears . 
" He suffered very little then , " she said , when Harry had told her how Cedric had died . 
" And after all , Amos ... he died just when he'd won the tournament . 
He must have been happy . " 
When they got to their feet , she looked down at Harry and said , " You look after yourself , now . " 
Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table . 
" Oh no , it's yours , dear , I couldn't . . . 
you keep it . " 
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening . 
From what Hermione and Ron told him , Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast . 
He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone , that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze . 
Most people , he noticed , were skirting him in the corridors , avoiding his eyes . 
He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter's article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was . 
He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking about other things , or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess . 
The only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs . Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home . 
" She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer , " he said . 
" But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys , at least at first . " 
" Why ? " said Harry . 
" She said Dumbledore's got his reasons , " said Ron , shaking his head darkly . 
" I suppose we ' ve got to trust him , haven't we ? " 
The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to was Hagrid . 
It was a bright and sunny day ; Fang bounded out of the open door as they approached , barking and wagging his tail madly . 
" Who's that ? " called Hagrid , coming to the door . 
" Harry ! " 
He strode out to meet them , pulled Harry into a one - armed hug , ruffled his hair , and said , " Good ter see yeh , mate . 
Good ter see yeh . " 
They saw two bucket - size cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered Hagrid's cabin . 
" Bin havin ' a cuppa with Olympe , " Hagrid said . 
" She's jus ' left . " 
" Who ? " said Ron curiously . 
" Madame Maxime , o ' course ! " said Hagrid . 
When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies , he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his beetle - black eyes . 
" You all righ ' ? " he said gruffly " Yeah , " said Harry . 
" No , yeh ' re not , " said Hagrid . 
But yeh will be . " 
Harry said nothing . 
" Knew he was goin'ter come back , " said Hagrid , and Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked up at him , shocked . 
Harry . 
Well , now it has , an ' we ' ll jus ' have ter get on with it . 
That's Dumbledores plan , anyway . 
Great man , Dumbledore . 
' S long as we ' ve got him , I'm not too worried . " 
Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces . 
" What's comin ' will come , an we ' ll meet it when it does . 
Dumbledore told me wha ' you did . 
Harry . " 
Hagrid's chest swelled as he looked at Harry . 
Harry smiled back at him . 
It was the first time he'd smiled in days . 
" What's Dumbledore asked you to do , Hagrid ? " he asked . 
" He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him - that night . " 
I'm not s ' pposed ter talk abou ' it , no , not even ter you lot . 
I think she will . 
Think I got her persuaded . " 
" Is it to do with Voldemort ? " 
Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name . 
" Migh ' be , " he said evasively . 
" Now . . . 
It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to Privet Drive . 
He was dreading the Leaving Feast , which was usually a cause for celebration , when the winner of the Inter - House Championship would be announced . 
He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing , preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students . 
When he , Ron , and Hermione entered the Hall , they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing . 
The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning House's colors for the Leaving Feast . 
Tonight , however , there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers ' table . 
Harry couldn't blame him ; Moodys fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten - month imprisonment in his own trunk . 
Professor Karkaroff s chair was empty . 
Harry wondered , as he sat down with the other Gryffindors , where Karkaroff was now , and whether Voldemort had caught up with him . 
Madame Maxime was still there . 
She was sitting next to Hagrid . 
Further along the table , sitting next to Professor McGonagall , was Snape . 
His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him . 
He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever . 
Harry continued to watch him , long after Snape had looked away . 
And why . . . 
why . . . 
was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side ? 
He had been their spy , Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve . 
Snape had turned spy against Voldemort , " at great personal risk . " 
Was that the job he had taken up again ? 
Had he made contact with the Death Eaters , perhaps ? 
Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore , that he had been , like Voldemort himself , biding his time ? 
He paused , and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table . 
Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet , and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall . 
" There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight , " said Dumbledore , " but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person , who should be sitting here , " he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs , " enjoying our feast with us . 
I would like you all , please , to stand , and raise your glasses , to Cedric Diggory . " 
They did it , all of them ; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood , and raised their goblets , and echoed , in one loud , low , rumbling voice , " Cedric Diggory . " 
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd . 
He looked down at the table as they all sat down again . 
" He was a good and loyal friend , a hard worker , he valued fair play . 
His death has affected you all , whether you knew him well or not . 
I think that you have the right , therefore , to know exactly how it came about . " 
Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore . 
" Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort . " 
People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief , in horror . 
" The Ministry of Magic , " Dumbledore continued , " does not wish me to tell you this . 
It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , or because they think I should not tell you so , young as you are . 
It is my belief , however , that the truth is generally preferable to lies , and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident , or some sort of blunder of his own , is an insult to his memory . " 
Stunned and frightened , every face in the Hall was turned toward Dumbledore now ... or almost every face . 
Over at the Slytherin table . 
Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle . 
Harry felt a hot , sick swoop of anger in his stomach . 
He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore . 
" I am talking , of course , about Harry Potter . " 
" Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort , " said Dumbledore . " He risked his own life to return Cedric's body to Hogwarts . 
He showed , in every respect , the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort , and for this , I honor him . " 
Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more . 
Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit . 
But through a gap in the standing figures . 
Harry saw that Malfoy , Crabbe , Goyle , and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats , their goblets untouched . 
Dumbledore , who after all possessed no magical eye , did not see them . 
In the light of what has happened - of Lord Voldemorts return - such ties are more important than ever before . " 
Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid , to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students , to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table . 
Krum , Harry saw , looked wary , almost frightened , as though he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh . 
I say to you all , once again - in the light of Lord Voldemort's return , we are only as strong as we are united , as weak as we are divided . 
We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust . 
" It is my belief - and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken - that we are all facing dark and difficult times . 
Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort . 
Many of your families have been torn asunder . 
" Remember Cedric . 
Remember , if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy , remember what happened to a boy who was good , and kind , and brave , because he strayed across the path of Lord 
Voldemort . 
Remember Cedric Diggory . " 
Harry's trunk was packed ; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it . 
He , Ron , and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station . 
It was another beautiful summer's day . 
He looked around . 
Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle . 
Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness . 
The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off . 
" I am ' oping to get a job ' ere , to improve my Eenglish . " 
" It's very good already , " said Ron in a strangled sort of voice . 
Fleur smiled at him ; Hermione scowled . 
" Good - bye , ' Arry , " said Fleur , turning to go . 
" It ' az been a pleasure meeting you ! " Harrys spirits couldn't help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime , her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight . 
Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back , " said Ron . " D ' you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff ? " 
" Karkaroff did not steer , " said a gruff voice . 
" He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork . " 
Krum had come to say good - bye to Hermione . 
" Could I have a vord ? " he asked her . 
" Oh . . . 
yes ... all right , " said Hermione , looking slightly flustered , and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight . 
" You'd better hurry up ! " Ron called loudly after her . 
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages , however , and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione might be up to . 
Ron stared at Hermione , but her face was quite impassive . 
" I liked Diggory , " said Krum abruptly to Harry . 
" He vos alvays polite to me . 
He held out his hand as Fleur had done , shook Harry's hand , and then Ron's . 
Hermione turned away , smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive , as Krum , looking surprised but gratified , signed a fragment of parchment for Ron . 
The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King's Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September . 
There wasn't a single cloud in the sky . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves . 
Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Rons dress robes to stop him from hooting continually ; Hedwig was dozing , her head under her wing , and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large , furry ginger cushion . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward . 
Harry felt as though Dumbledore's speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him , somehow . 
When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag , she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in there . 
Harry looked at it , unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say , but Hermione , seeing him looking at it , said calmly , " There's nothing in there . 
I ' ve been checking every day . 
Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament . 
They didn't even mention Cedric . 
If you ask me . 
Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet . " 
" He ' ll never keep Rita quiet , " said Harry . 
Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her . " " What are you talking about ? " said Ron . " I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn't supposed to be coming onto the grounds , " said Hermione in a rush . 
Harry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell them this for days , but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened . 
" How was she doing it ? " said Harry at once . 
" How did you find out ? " said Ron , staring at her . " Well , it was you , really , who gave me the idea . 
Harry , " she said . 
" Did I ? " said Harry , perplexed . 
" How ? " " Bugging , " said Hermione happily . 
" But you said they didn't work - " " Oh not electronic bugs , " said Hermione . 
" - into a beetle . " 
" You ' re kidding , " said Ron . " You haven't .. . 
she's not ... " " Oh yes she is , " said Hermione happily , brandishing the jar at them . 
Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large , fat beetle . 
" That's never - you ' re kidding - " Ron whispered , lifting the jar to his eyes . 
" No , I'm not , " said Hermione , beaming . 
" I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing . 
Harry looked and saw that she was quite right . 
He also remembered something . 
" There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum ! " " Exactly , " said Hermione . 
And unless I'm very much mistaken , Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt . 
" When we saw Malfoy under that tree ... " said Ron slowly . 
" He was talking to her , in his hand , " said Hermione . 
" He knew , of course . 
That's how she's been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins . 
They wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal , as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid . " 
Hermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle , which buzzed angrily against the glass . 
" I ' ve told her I ' ll let her out when we get back to London , " said Hermione . 
" I ' ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar , you see , so she can't transform . 
And I ' ve told her she's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year . 
The door of the compartment slid open . 
" Very clever . 
Granger , " said Draco Malfoy . 
Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him . 
" So , " said Malfoy slowly , advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them , a smirk quivering on his lips . 
Crabbe and Goyle leered . 
" Trying not to think about it , are we ? " said Malfoy softly , looking around at all three of them . 
" Get out , " said Harry . 
He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears . 
His hand gripped his wand under his robes . 
" You ' ve picked the losing side , Potter ! 
I warned you ! 
I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully , remember ? 
When we met on the train , first day at Hogwarts ? 
I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this ! " 
He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione . 
Potter ! 
They ' ll be the first to go , now the Dark Lord's back ! 
Mudbloods and Muggle - lovers first ! 
Well - second Diggory was the f - " It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment . 
Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction , deafened by a series of bangs , Harry blinked and looked down at the floor . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway . 
He , Ron , and Hermione were on their feet , all three of them having used a different hex . 
" Interesting effect , " said George , looking down at Crabbe . 
" Who used the Furnunculus Curse ? " 
" Me , " said Harry . 
" Odd , " said George lightly . 
" I used Jelly - Legs . 
Well , let's not leave them here , they don't add much to the decor . " 
Ron , Harry , and George kicked , rolled , and pushed the unconscious Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle - each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit - out into the corridor , then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut . 
They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them . 
" You going to tell us , then ? " he said to George . 
" Who you were blackmailing ? " 
" Oh , " said George darkly . 
" That . " 
" It doesn't matter , " said Fred , shaking his head impatiently . 
" We ' ve given up , " said George , shrugging . 
But Harry , Ron , and Hermione kept on asking , and finally , Fred said , " All right , all right , if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman . " 
" Bagman ? " said Harry sharply . 
" Nothing like that . 
" Well , what , then ? " said Ron . Fred hesitated , then said , " You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup ? 
About how Ireland would win , but Krum would get the Snitch ? " " Yeah , " said Harry and Ron slowly . 
" Well , the git paid us in leprechaun gold he'd caught from the Irish mascots . " 
" So ? " " So , " said Fred impatiently , " it vanished , didn't it ? 
By next morning , it had gone ! " " But - it must ' ve been an accident , mustn't it ? " said Hermione . 
George laughed very bitterly . 
" Yeah , that's what we thought , at first . 
We thought if we just wrote to him , and told him he'd made a mistake , he'd cough up . 
But nothing doing . 
We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts , but he was always making some excuse to get away from us . " " In the end , he turned pretty nasty , " said Fred . " Told us we were too young to gamble , and he wasn't giving us anything . " 
" So we asked for our money back , " said George glowering . 
" He didn't refuse ! " gasped Hermione . 
" Right in one , " said Fred . " But that was all your savings ! " said Ron . " Tell me about it , " said George . 
Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins . 
A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had , and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts . 
They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him . 
He's lost everything gambling . 
And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back ? " " How ? " said Harry . 
" He put a bet on you , mate , " said Fred . " Put a big bet on you to win the tournament . 
" So that's why he kept trying to help me win ! " said Harry . 
" Well - I did win , didn't I ? So he can pay you your gold ! " " Nope , " said George , shaking his head . 
" The goblins play as dirty as him . 
So Bagman had to run for it . 
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough ; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer , in fact , and that he would never arrive at King's Cross . . . 
but as he had learned the hard way that year , time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead , and all too soon , the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three - quarters . 
The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark . 
Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , carrying their trunks . 
Harry , however , stayed put . 
" Fred - George - wait a moment . " 
The twins turned . 
Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard winnings . 
" Take it , " he said , and he thrust the sack into George's hands . 
" What ? " said Fred , looking flabbergasted . 
" Take it , " Harry repeated firmly . 
" I don't want it . " 
" You ' re mental , " said George , trying to push it back at Harry . 
" No , I'm not , " said Harry . 
" You take it , and get inventing . 
It's for the joke shop . " 
" Listen , " said Harry firmly . 
" If you don't take it , I'm throwing it down the drain . 
I don't want it and I don't need it . 
But I could do with a few laughs . 
" Harry , " said George weakly , weighing the money bag in his hands , " there's got to be a thousand Galleons in here . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry , grinning . 
The twins stared at him . 
" Just don't tell your mum where you got it ... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore , come to think of it . . . 
. " " Harry , " Fred began , but Harry pulled out his wand . 
He left the compartment before they could say another word , stepping over Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , who were still lying on the floor , covered in hex marks . 
Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier . 
Mrs . Weasley was close by him . 
She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear , " I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer . 
Keep in touch , Harry . " 
" See you . 
Harry , " said Ron , clapping him on the back . 
" ' Bye , Harry ! " said Hermione , and she did something she had never done before , and kissed him on the cheek . 
Harry winked at them , turned to Uncle Vernon , and followed him silently from thg yet , he told himself , as he got into the back of the Dursleys ' car . e station . 
There was no point worryin
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 
The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large , square houses of Privet Drive . 
Deprived of their usual car - washing and lawn - mowing pursuits , the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses , windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze . 
The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four . 
He was a skinny , black - haired , bespectacled boy who had the pinched , slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time . 
His jeans were torn and dirty , his T - shirt baggy and faded , and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers . 
Harry Potter's appearance did not endear him to the neighbors , who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law , but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers - by . 
In fact , the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living - room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below . 
On the whole , Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here . 
He was not , perhaps , very comfortable lying on the hot , hard earth but , on the other hand , nobody was glaring at him , grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news , or shooting nasty questions at him , as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle . 
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window , Vernon Dursley , Harry's uncle , suddenly spoke . 
" Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in . 
Where is he , anyway ? " 
" Not in the house . " 
Uncle Vernon grunted . 
" I'd like to know what he's really up to . 
" Vernon , shh ! " said Aunt Petunia . 
" The window's open ! " 
Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ' n ' Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs . Figg , a batty cat - loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk , amble slowly past . 
She was frowning and muttering to herself . 
Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush , as Mrs . Figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street . 
She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again . 
The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son , Dudley . 
They had swallowed all his dim - witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays . 
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere ; he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park , smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children . 
Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging ; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets , scavenging newspapers from bins along the way . 
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o ' clock news reached Harry's ears and his stomach turned over . 
Perhaps tonight - after a month of waiting - would be the night . 
" Give ' em a lifelong siesta , I would , " snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader's sentence , but no matter : outside in the flowerbed , Harry's stomach seemed to unclench . 
If anything had happened , it would surely have been the first item on the news ; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers . 
He let out a long , slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky . 
Every day this summer had been the same : the tension , the expectation , the temporary relief , and then mounting tension again … and always , growing more insistent all the time , the question of why nothing had happened yet . 
He kept listening , just in case there was some small clue , not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles - an unexplained disappearance , perhaps , or some strange accident … but the baggage - handlers'strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast ( " I hope he's listening next door ! " 
bellowed Uncle Vernon . 
" Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning ! " ) , then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey , then a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband ( " As if we ' re interested in their sordid affairs , " sniffed Aunt Petunia , who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on ) . 
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said , " - and finally , Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer . 
Bungy , who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley , has learned to water ski ! Mary Dorkins went to find out more . " 
Harry opened his eyes . 
If they had reached water - skiing budgerigars , there would be nothing else worth hearing . 
He rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows , preparing to crawl out from under the window . 
A loud , echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot ; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight ; a shriek , a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys ' living room , and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet , at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword - but before he could draw himself up to full height , the top of his head collided with the Dursleys ' open window . 
The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder . 
Harry felt as though his head had been split in two . 
Eyes streaming , he swayed , trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise , but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat . 
" Put - it - away ! " Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear . 
For a few seconds they struggled , Harry pulling at his uncles sausage - like fingers with his left hand , his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand ; then , as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb , Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock . 
Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew , making him impossible to hold . 
Panting , Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush , straightened up and stared around . 
There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise , but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows . 
He continued to grin in a horrible , manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows , then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him . 
" What the devil do you mean by it , boy ? " asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury . 
" What do I mean by what ? " said Harry coldly . 
He kept looking left and right up the street , still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise . 
Aunt Petunia's thin , horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon's wide , purple one . 
What were you doing under our window , boy ? " 
" Listening to the news , " said Harry in a resigned voice . 
" Listening to the news ! 
I want to know what you ' re really up to - and don't give me any more of this listening to the news tosh ! 
" Careful , Vernon ! " breathed Aunt Petunia , and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him , " - that your lot don't get on our news ! " 
" That's all you know , " said Harry . 
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds , then Aunt Petunia said , " You ' re a nasty little liar . 
What are all those - " she , too , lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip - read the next word , " - owls doing if they ' re not bringing you news ? " 
" Get out of that one , boy ! 
Harry hesitated for a moment . 
" We're not stupid , you know , " said Uncle Vernon . 
" Well , that's news to me , " said Harry , his temper rising , and before the Dursleys could call him back , he had wheeled about , crossed the front lawn , stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street . 
He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness , but he did not care very much just at the moment ; he had much more pressing matters on his mind . 
Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment ? 
As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive , but it appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible . 
Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder . 
Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia's dying begonias , he was sure of it . 
Why hadn't they spoken to him , why hadn't they made contact , why were they hiding now ? 
And then , as his feeling of frustration peaked , his certainty leaked away . 
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises . 
Could he be sure it hadn't been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor's house ? 
Harry felt a dull , sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again . 
Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o ' clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet - but was there any point continuing to take it ? 
Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days ; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was back it would be headline news , and that was the only kind Harry cared about . 
If he was lucky , there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione , though any expectation he'd had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed . 
We can't say much about you - know - what , obviously … We ' ve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray … We're quite busy but I can't give you details here … There's a fair amount going on , we ' ll tell you everything when we see you … 
But when were they going to see him ? 
As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters , Hermione and Ron were in the same place , presumably at Ron's parents ' house . 
He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive . 
In fact , he was so angry with them he had thrown away , unopened , the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they'd sent him for his birthday . 
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with ? 
Why wasn't he , Harry , busy ? 
Hadn't it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered , and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed ? 
It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares , without dwelling on it in his waking moments too . 
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent ; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather . 
Sirius , at least , seemed to understand how Harry was feeling . 
Admittedly , his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione's , but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints : 
I know this must be frustrating for you … Keep your nose clean and everything will be okay … Be careful and don't do anything rash … 
He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself . 
In fact , Harry thought his behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long , reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing . 
Nevertheless , it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison , Azkaban , escaped , attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place , then gone on the run with a stolen Hippogriff . 
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass . 
The park was as empty as the surrounding streets . 
When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break , coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground . 
He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys ' flowerbed again . 
Tomorrow , he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news . 
In the meantime , he had nothing to look forward to but another restless , disturbed night , because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors , all finishing in dead ends and locked doors , which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake . 
Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably , but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more . 
In the past , his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again , but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected … nothing to worry about … old news … 
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks , completely cut off from the magical world , reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about water - skiing budgerigars ! 
How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily ? 
Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along , too ? 
How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy ; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned ? 
These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry's head , and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry , velvety night fell around him , the air full of the smell of warm , dry grass , and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings . 
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up . 
The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park . 
Harry knew who those people were . 
The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin , Dudley Dursley , wending his way home , accompanied by his faithful gang . 
Dudley was as vast as ever , but a year's hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique . 
As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen , Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter - School Boxing Champion of the Southeast . 
' The noble sport ' , as Uncle Vernon called it , had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley's first punching bag . 
Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn't think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration . 
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight . 
He wouldn't want to lose face in front of the gang , but he'd be terrified of provoking Harry … it would be really fun to watch Dudley's dilemma , to taunt him , watch him , with him powerless to respond … and if any of the others tried hitting Harry , he was ready - he had his wand . 
But they didn't turn around , they didn't see him , they were almost at the railings . 
Kept my nose clean . 
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home , and any time after that was much too late . 
Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley ever again , so , stifling a yawn , and still scowling , Harry set off towards the park gate . 
Harry preferred Little Whinging by night , when the curtained windows made patches of jewel bright color in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his'delinquent ' appearance when he passed the householders . 
He walked quickly , so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley's gang came into view again ; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent . 
Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited . 
" Same time tomorrow ? " said Dudley . 
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again . 
" It's you . " 
" You don't tell her to shut her face . 
What about ' Popkin ' and ' Dinky Diddydums ' , can I use them then ? " 
Dudley said nothing . 
" Yeah ? 
Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs ? 
Cause that's not cheek , Dud , that's true . " 
It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley ; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin , the only outlet he had . 
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk . 
Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other . 
" What thing ? " 
Harry grinned again . 
" Not as stupid as you look , are you , Dud ? 
But I s ' pose , if you were , you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time . " 
Harry pulled out his wand . 
" You ' re not allowed , " Dudley said at once . 
" I know you ' re not . 
Harry laughed softly . 
" You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing , have you ? " 
" Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old . 
" He was sixteen , for your information , " snarled Dudley , " and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I'd finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you . 
You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out – " 
That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this . " 
Harry stopped too , staring at his cousin . 
From the little he could see of Dudley's large face , he was wearing a strangely triumphant look . 
" What d ' you mean , I'm not brave when I'm in bed ? " s aid Harry , completely nonplussed . 
" I heard you last night , " said Dudley breathlessly . 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" ' Don't kill Cedric ! 
Don't kill Cedric ! ' Who's Cedric - your boyfriend ? " 
" I - you ' re lying , " said Harry automatically . 
But his mouth had gone dry . 
" Dad ! Help me , Dad ! He's going to kill me , Dad ! Boo hoo ! " 
" Shut up , Dudley , I'm warning you ! " 
" Come and help me , Dad ! Mum , come and help me ! 
He's killed Cedric ! 
Dad , help me ! 
Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley's heart . 
" I said , do you understand me ? " 
Something had happened to the night . 
The star - strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and lightless - the stars , the moon , the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished . 
The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone . 
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to , despite the fact that he'd been resisting as hard as he could - then his reason caught up with his senses - he didn't have the power to turn off the stars . 
He turned his head this way and that , trying to see something , but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil . 
Dudley's terrified voice broke in Harry's ear . 
" W - what are you d - doing ? 
" I'm not doing anything ! 
I ' ve g - gone blind ! 
I - " 
Harry stood stock still , turning his sightless eyes left and right . 
The cold was so intense he was shivering all over ; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up - he opened his eyes to their fullest extent , staring blankly around , unseeing . 
" I ' ll t - tell Dad ! " Dudley whimpered . 
" W - where are you ? 
What are you d - do — ? " 
" Will you shut up ? " Harry hissed , " I'm trying to lis — " 
He had heard just the thing he had been dreading . 
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves , something that was drawing long , hoarse , rattling breaths . 
I ' ll h - hit you , I swear I will ! " 
A fist made contact with the side of Harry's head , lifting him off his feet . 
For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his head had been cleaved in two ; next moment , he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his hand . 
Harry yelled , his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees , feeling around frantically in the blackness . 
He heard Dudley blundering away , hitting the alley fence , stumbling . 
At the same moment , Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing . 
There was more than one . 
" Where's - wand - come on - lumos ! " 
He said the spell automatically , desperate for light to help him in his search - and to his disbelieving relief , light flared inches from his right hand - the wand tip had ignited . 
Harry snatched it up , scrambled to his feet and turned around . 
A towering , hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him , hovering over the ground , no feet or face visible beneath its robes , sucking on the night as it came . 
Stumbling backwards , Harry raised his wand . 
A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed , but the spell hadn't worked properly ; tripping over his own feet , Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore down upon him , panic fogging his brain - concentrate – 
His voice sounded dim and distant . 
Another wisp of silver smoke , feebler than the last , drifted from the wand - he couldn't do it any more , he couldn't work the spell . 
But there was no happiness in him … the Dementor's icy fingers were closing on his throat - the high - pitched laughter was growing louder and louder , and a voice spoke inside his head : " Bow to death , Harry … it might even be painless … I would no t know … I have never died … " 
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry's wand ; its antlers caught the Dementor in the place where the heart should have been ; it was thrown backwards , weightless as darkness , and as the stag charged , the Dementor swooped away , bat - like and defeated . 
" THIS WAY ! " Harry shouted at the stag . 
Wheeling around , he sprinted down the alleyway , holding the lit wand aloft . 
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them : Dudley was curled up on the ground , his arms clamped over his face . 
The Dementor's eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley's when the silver antlers caught it ; the thing was thrown up into the air and , like its fellow , it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness ; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist . 
A warm breeze swept the alleyway . 
Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again . 
After a moment , he became aware that his T - shirt was sticking to him ; he was drenched in sweat . 
He could not believe what had just happened . 
Dementors here , in Little Whinging . 
Dudley lay curled up on the ground , whimpering and shaking . 
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up , but then he heard loud , running footsteps behind him . 
Instinctively raising his wand again , he span on his heel to face the newcomer . 
Her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet , a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers . 
Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight , but - 
Oh , I'm going to kill Mundungus Fletcher ! " 
" Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom ! 
I told him I'd flay him alive if he went , and now look ! 
Dementors ! 
But we haven't got time to stand around ! 
Hurry , now , we ' ve got to get you back ! 
Oh , the trouble this is going to cause ! 
I will kill him ! " 
He left you completely without cover when I'd warned him - " 
He Disapparated from the front of my house ! " 
" Yes , yes , yes , but luckily I'd stationed Mr . Tibbies under a car just in case , and Mr . Tibbies came and warned me , but by the time I got to your house you'd gone - and now - oh , what's Dumbledore going to say ? You ! " she shrieked at Dudley , still supine on the alley floor . 
" You know Dumbledore ? " said Harry , staring at her . 
" Of course I know Dumbledore , who doesn't know Dumbledore ? 
" Get up , you useless lump , get up ! " 
But Dudley either could not or would not move . 
" I ' ll do it . " 
With an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet . 
Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting . 
His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face ; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously . 
Harry pulled one of Dudley's massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road , sagging slightly under the weight . 
Talk about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery … this was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of - What's that at the end of the street ? 
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul Dudley along at the same time . 
Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs , but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement . 
" Why didn't you tell me you ' re a Squib , Mrs . Figg ? " asked Harry , panting with the effort to keep walking . 
I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything , you were too young . 
I can't Apparate . " 
" But I was getting rid of Dementors , I had to use magic - they ' re going to be more worried about what Dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk , surely ? " 
" Oh , my dear , I wish it were so , but I'm afraid - MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER , I AM GOING TO KILL YOU ! " 
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat , unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them . 
He had short , bandy legs , long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot , baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound . 
" I ' ll give you undercover ! " cried Mrs . Figg . 
" Dementors , ' ere ? " 
" Yes , here , you worthless pile of bat droppings , here ! " 
" Blimey , I - " 
Didn't I tell you not to go ? Didn't I ! " 
Mrs . Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it ; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food . 
" And - it - had - better - be - you - and - you - can - tell - him - why - you - weren't - there - to - help ! " 
" I'm going , I'm going ! " 
" I ' ll take you to the door , " said Mrs . Figg , as they turned into Privet Drive . 
" Just in case there are more of them around … oh my word , what a catastrophe … and you had to fight them off yourself … and Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs … well , it's no good crying over spilt potion , I suppose … but the cat's among the pixies now . " 
" I expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough . " 
" What are you going to do ? " asked Harry quickly . 
Just stay in the house . 
I want to know - " 
Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans , rang the bell and watched Aunt Petunia's outline grow larger and larger , oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door . 
" Diddy ! 
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time . 
Dudley swayed on the spot for a moment , his face pale green … then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat . 
" DIDDY ! Diddy , what's the matter with you ? 
Harry's uncle came galumphing out of the living room , walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated . 
He hurried forwards to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak - kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick . 
" He's ill , Vernon ! " 
" What is it , son ? 
What's happened ? 
Have you been lying on the ground ? " 
" Hang on - you haven't been mugged , have you , son ? " 
Aunt Petunia screamed . 
" Phone the police , Vernon ! 
Phone the police ! 
What did they do to you ? " 
He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and , while the Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen , Harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs . 
" Shh ! He's trying to say something , Vernon ! 
What is it , Diddy ? 
Harry froze , foot on the stair , face screwed up , braced for the explosion . 
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger , Harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys . 
Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair ; he was still very green and clammy - looking . 
" Nothing , " said Harry , knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn't believe him . 
" What did he do to you , Diddy ? " Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice , now sponging sick from the front of Dudley's leather jacket . 
" Was it - was it you - know - what , darling ? 
Did he use – his thing ? " 
" I didn't do anything to him , it wasn't me , it was – " 
Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon's head , it soared across the kitchen , dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry's feet , turned gracefully , the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge , then zoomed outside again and off across the garden . 
" OWLS ! " bellowed Uncle Vernon , the well - worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut . 
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside , his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam's apple . 
We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty - three minutes past nine this evening in a Muggle - inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle . 
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
As you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy , we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a . m . on the twelfth of August . 
Hoping you are well , 
Improper Use of Magic Office 
Ministry of Magic 
Harry read the letter through twice . 
He was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking . 
Inside his head , all was icy and numb . 
It was all over . 
He looked up at the Dursleys . 
Uncle Vernon was purple - faced , shouting , his fists still raised ; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley , who was retching again . 
Harry's temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken . 
There was only one thing for it . 
Where he was going to go , Harry didn't know , but he was certain of one thing : at Hogwarts or outside it , he needed his wand . 
In an almost dream like state , he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen . 
" Where d ' you think you ' re going ? " yelled Uncle Vernon . 
When Harry didn't reply , he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall . 
" Get out of the way , " said Harry quietly . 
" If you don't get out of the way I'm going to jinx you , " said Harry , raising the wand . 
" I know you ' re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school ! " 
" So I can do whatever I like . 
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen . 
Aunt Petunia screamed , ' Hide ! ' Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked , but for the third time that night Harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made . 
He spotted it at once : a dazed and ruffled - looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill , having just collided with the closed window . 
Ignoring Uncle Vernon's anguished yell of ' OWLS ! ' Harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open . 
The owl stuck out its leg , to which a small roll of parchment was tied , shook its leathers , and took off the moment Harry had taken the letter . 
Hands shaking , Harry unfurled the second message , which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink . 
Harry — 
Dumbledore's just arrived at the Ministry and he's trying to sort it all out . 
DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC . 
Arthur Weasley 
A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry's chest , almost immediately strangled by panic - how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic ? 
He'd have to duel with the Ministry representatives , and if he did that , he'd be lucky to escape Azkaban , let alone expulsion . 
" Right , " Harry said , " I ' ve changed my mind , I'm staying . " 
He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and Aunt Petunia . 
" The first one was from the Ministry of Magic , expelling me , " said Harry calmly . 
He was straining his ears to catch any noises outside , in case the Ministry representatives were approaching , and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon's questions than to have him start raging and bellowing . 
" Ministry of Magic ? " bellowed Uncle Vernon . 
Oh , this explains everything , everything , no wonder the country's going to the dogs . " 
" AHA ! " roared Uncle Vernon , slamming his fist down on top of the fridge , which sprang open ; several of Dudley's low - fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor . 
What did you do to Dudley ? " 
" Tell us , darling , " whispered Aunt Petunia . 
" Yeah , I did , but I didn't use - " Harry began angrily , but – 
" All went dark , " Dudley said hoarsely , shuddering . 
And then I h - heard … things . 
If their least favorite thing in the world was magic - closely followed by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban - people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten . 
" What sort of things did you hear , Popkin ? " breathed Aunt Petunia , very white - faced and with tears in her eyes . 
He shuddered again and shook his large blond head , and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl , he felt a certain curiosity . 
" How come you fell over , son ? " said Uncle Vernon , in an unnaturally quiet voice , the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person . 
" And then – " 
Harry understood . 
Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you . 
Really cold . " 
" What happened then , Dudders ? " 
" How many times do I have to tell you ? " said Harry , temper and voice both rising . 
" Two of them . " 
" And what the ruddy hell are Dementors ? " 
Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word . 
Uncle Vernon was goggling at her . Harry's brain reeled . 
Mrs . Figg was one thing - but Aunt Petunia ? 
" How d ' you know that ? " he asked her , astonished . 
Harry was stunned . 
Except for one outburst years ago , in the course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry's mother had been a freak , he had never heard her mention her sister . 
He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long , when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didn't exist . 
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth , closed it again , opened it once more , shut it , then , apparently struggling to remember how to talk , opened it for a third time and croaked , " So - so - they - er - they - er - they actually exist , do they - er - Dementy - whatsits ? " 
Aunt Petunia nodded . 
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout ' April Fool ! ' When nobody did , he opened his mouth yet again , but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening . 
It zoomed through the still - open window like a feathery cannon - ball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table , causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright . 
Harry tore a second official - looking envelope from the owls beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night . 
" Enough - effing - owls , " muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly , stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again . 
Further to our letter of approximately twenty - two minutes ago , the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith . 
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time .

" Well ? " said Uncle Vernon , recalling Harry to his surroundings . 
" What now ? 
Have they sentenced you to anything ? 
" I ' ve got to go to a hearing , " said Harry . 
" I suppose so . " 
" Well , if that's all , " said Harry , getting to his feet . 
He was desperate to be alone , to think , perhaps to send a letter to Ron , Hermione or Sirius . 
" I want to know exactly what happened to my son ! " 
" FINE ! " yelled Harry , and in his temper , red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand , still clutched in his hand . 
" Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk , " said Harry , speaking fast , fighting to control his temper . 
" What do they DO ? " 
" I told you - they suck all the happiness out of you , " said Harry , " and if they get the chance , they kiss you - 
" Kiss you ? " 
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream . 
" Fought ' em off , did you , son ? " said Uncle Vernon loudly , with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood . 
With a clattering , a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust , a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace . 
He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore , explaining everything - the Dementors , Mrs . Figg , what the Ministry was up to , how he , Dumbledore , intended to sort everything out - that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting . 
Ignoring Uncle Vernon's on going rant about owls , and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl look off back up the chimney , Harry read Sirius's message . 
Arthur's just told us what's happened . 
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over , looking for the rest of the letter , but there was nothing else . 
And now his temper was rising again . 
" … A peck , I mean , pack of owls shooting in and out of my house . 
You did you - know - what , you ' ve admitted it ! " 
Harry took a deep , steadying breath . 
He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen , and away from the Dursleys . 
" I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors , " he said , forcing himself to remain calm . 
" No idea . " 
His head was pounding in the glare of the strip - lighting now . 
" It's you , " said Uncle Vernon forcefully . 
You ' ve got to be the only - the only - " Evidently , he couldn't bring himself to say the word ' wizard ' " the only you know - what for miles . " 
But at Uncle Vernon's words , Harry's exhausted brain had ground back into action . 
Why had the Dementors come to Little Whinging ? 
Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the Dementors ? 
Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort , as Dumbledore had predicted they would ? 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
If only his head would stop hurting , if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think … 
" That's it , isn't it , boy ? 
You ' re on the run from the law ! " 
" Of course I'm not , " said Harry , shaking his head as though to scare off a fly , his mind racing now . 
" He must have sent them , " said Harry quietly , more to himself than to Uncle Vernon . 
" What's that ? 
Who must have sent them ? " 
" Lord Voldemort , " said Harry . 
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys , who flinched , winced and squawked if they heard words like ' wizard ' , ' magic ' or ' wand ' , could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor . 
" I ' ve heard that name … that was the one who — " 
" But he's gone , " said Uncle Vernon impatiently , without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic . 
He's gone . " 
" He's back , " said Harry heavily . 
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen , beside the top of - the - range fridge and the wide - screen television , talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon . 
The arrival of the Dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have breached the great , invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non - magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond , Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upsidedown ; the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world , and Mrs . Figg knew Albus Dumbledore ; Dementors were soaring around Little Whinging , and he might never return to Hogwarts . 
" Back ? " whispered Aunt Petunia . 
She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before . 
And all of a sudden , for the very first time in his life , Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother's sister . 
All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean . 
Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before . 
The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry's life - that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon - seemed to have fallen away . 
" Yes , " Harry said , talking directly to Aunt Petunia now . 
I saw him . " 
" Hang on , " said Uncle Vernon , looking from his wife to Harry and back again , apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them . 
" Hang on . 
" Yes . " 
" Yes . " 
" Looks like it , " said Harry . 
" I see , " said Uncle Vernon , looking from his white - faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" You heard me - OUT ! " Uncle Vernon bellowed , and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped . 
You ' re not staying here if some loony's after you , you ' re not endangering my wife and son , you ' re not bringing trouble down on us . 
Harry stood rooted to the spot . 
The letters from the Ministry , Mr . Weasley and Sirius were all crushed in his left hand . 
" You heard me ! " said Uncle Vernon , bending forward now , his massive purple face coming so close to Harry's , he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face . 
You were all keen to leave half an hour ago ! 
I'm right behind you ! 
Why we ever kept you in the first place , I don't know , Marge was right , it should have been the orphanage . 
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech . 
Harry raised his hand to seize the letter , which was in a scarlet envelope , but it soared straight over his head , flying directly at Aunt Petunia , who let out a scream and ducked , her arms over her face . 
The owl dropped the red envelope on her head , turned , and flew straight back up the chimney . 
Harry darted forwards to pick up the letter , but Aunt Petunia beat him to it . 
" You can open it if you like , " said Harry , " but I ' ll hear what it says anyway . 
That's a Howler . " 
" Don't touch it , it could be dangerous ! " 
" It's addressed to me , " said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice . 
" It's addressed to me , Vernon , look ! 
Mrs . Petunia Dursley , The Kitchen , Number Four , Privet Drive – " 
" Open it ! ' 
Harry urged her . 
" No . " 
Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling . 
She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route , but too late - the envelope burst into flames . 
Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it . 
An awful voice filled the kitchen , echoing in the confined space , issuing from the burning letter on the table . 
Remember my last , Petunia . 
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint . 
The remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence . 
" What is this ? " Uncle Vernon said hoarsely . 
Aunt Petunia said nothing . 
Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother , his mouth hanging open . 
The silence spiraled horribly . 
Harry was watching his aunt , utterly bewildered , his head throbbing fit to burst . 
" Petunia , dear ? " said Uncle Vernon timidly . 
She raised her head . 
She was still trembling . 
" The boy - the boy will have to stay , Vernon , " she said weakly . 
" He stays , " she said . 
She was not looking at Harry . 
" He … but Petunia … " 
" If we throw him out , the neighbors will talk , " she said . 
She was rapidly regaining her usual brisk , snappish manner , though she was still very pale . 
Aunt Petunia ignored him . 
She turned to Harry . 
" You ' re to stay in your room , " she said . 
" You ' re not to leave the house . 
Harry didn't move . 
" Are you in touch with wizards ? " 
" I told you to get to bed ! " 
" What did it mean ? 
Remember the last what ? " 
I ' ve just been attacked by Dementors and I might be expelled from Hogwarts . 
I want to know what's going on and when I'm going to get out of here . 
Harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom . 
He addressed the first to Sirius , the second to Ron and the third to Hermione . 
His owl , Hedwig , was off hunting ; her cage stood empty on the desk . 
Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back , his head pounding , his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness . 
His back ached from hauling Dudley home , and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully . 
Up and down he paced , consumed with anger and frustration , grinding his teeth and clenching his fists , casting angry looks out at the empty , star - strewn sky every time he passed the window . 
Dementors sent to get him , Mrs . Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret , then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic - and still no one was telling him what was going on . 
And what , what , had that Howler been about ? 
He kicked his school trunk as he passed it , but far from relieving his anger he felt worse , as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body . 
" Come here , " said Harry , picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg . 
" Take these straight to Sirius , Ron and Hermione and don't come back here without good long replies . 
In addition to every other miserable feeling , he now felt guilty that he'd been irritable with Hedwig ; she was the only friend he had at number four , Privet Drive . 
But he'd make it up to her when she came back with the answers from Sirius , Ron and Hermione . 
He'd probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to The Burrow . 
But Hedwig didn't return next morning . 
Harry spent the day in his bedroom , leaving it only to go to the bathroom . 
Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago . 
Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler , but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got . 
So it went on for three whole days . 
Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything , during which time he paced his bedroom , furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess ; and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time , staring dazedly into space , aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing . 
What if they ruled against him ? 
What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half ? 
What would he do , where would he go ? 
He could not return to living full - time with the Dursleys , not now he knew the other world , the one to which he really belonged . 
Might he be able to move into Sirius's house , as Sirius had suggested a year ago , before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry ? 
Would Harry be allowed to live there alone , given that he was still underage ? 
Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban ? 
On the fourth night after Hedwig's departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases , staring at the ceiling , his exhausted mind quite blank , when his uncle entered his bedroom . 
Harry looked slowly around at him . 
" Fine , " said Harry dully , looking back at the ceiling . 
" You are not to touch the television , the stereo , or any of our possessions . " 
" You are not to steal food from the fridge . " 
" You do that . " 
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry , clearly suspicious of this lack of argument , then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him . 
Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs . 
A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors , the rumble of an engine , and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive . 
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving . 
It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not . 
He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light . 
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time , waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned . 
The empty house creaked around him . 
The pipes gurgled . 
Harry lay there in a kind of stupor , thinking of nothing , suspended in misery . 
There was silence for a few seconds , then voices . 
Burglars , he thought , sliding off the bed on to his feet - but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down , and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so . 
He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door , listening with all his might . 
Next moment , he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open . 
He hesitated for a moment , then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs . 
There were people standing in the shadowy hall below , silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door ; eight or nine of them , all , as far as he could see , looking up at him . 
Harry's heart was thumping uncontrollably . 
He knew that voice , but he did not lower his wand . 
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it , nor did he move . 
He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad - Eye Moody's company only to find out that it wasn't Moody at all , but an impostor ; an impostor , moreover , who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked . 
But before he could make a decision about what to do next , a second , slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs . 
" It's all right , Harry . 
We ' ve come to take you away . " 
Harry's heart leapt . 
He knew that voice , too , though he hadn't heard it for over a year . 
" Is that you ? " 
" Why are we all standing in the dark ? " said a third voice , this one completely unfamiliar , a woman's . 
Harry blinked . 
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him . 
Though still quite young , Lupin looked tired and rather ill ; he had more grey hairs than when Harry had last said goodbye to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever . 
" Oooh , he looks just like I thought he would , " said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft . 
She looked the youngest there ; she had a pale heart - shaped face , dark twinkling eyes , and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet . 
" Wotcher , Harry ! " 
" Yeah , I see what you mean , Remus , " said a bald black wizard standing furthest back - he had a deep , slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear - " he looks exactly like James . " 
" Except the eyes , " said a wheezy - voiced , silver - haired wizard at the back . 
Mad - Eye Moody , who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose , was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes . 
One eye was small , dark and beady , the other large , round and electric blue - the magical eye that could see through walls , doors and the back of Moody's own head . 
We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know . 
Very conscious of everybody still staring at him , Harry descended the stairs , stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came . 
" What if it ignited ? 
Better wizards than you have lost buttocks , you know ! " 
" Who d ' you know who's lost a buttock ? " the violet - haired woman asked Mad - Eye interestedly . 
He stumped off towards the kitchen . 
Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry's . 
" How are you ? " he asked , looking closely at Harry . 
Four weeks with nothing , not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive , and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter - of factly in the house as though this was a long - standing arrangement . 
He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin ; they were still gazing avidly at him . 
He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days . 
" It was me who lured them out of the way . 
They're heading off to the prize - giving right now … or they think they are . " 
The Burrow ? " Harry asked hopefully . 
" Not The Burrow , no , " said Lupin , motioning Harry towards the kitchen ; the little knot of wizards followed , all still eyeing Harry curiously . 
Mad - Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask , his magical eye spinning in all directions , taking in the Dursleys ' many labor - saving appliances . 
" Yeah , I know , " said Harry uncomfortably . 
" And this is Nymphadora - " 
" We ' ve met before , " squeaked the excitable Diggle , dropping his violet - colored top hat . 
" And Hestia Jones . " 
Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced . 
He wished they would look at something other than him ; it was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage . 
" A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you , " said Lupin , as though he had read Harry's mind ; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly . 
" Yeah , well , the more the better , " said Moody darkly . 
" We're just waiting for the signal to tell us it's safe to set off , " said Lupin , glancing out of the kitchen window . 
" Very clean , aren't they , these Muggles ? " said the witch called Tonks , who was looking around the kitchen with great interest . 
I suppose it varies , just as it does with wizards ? " 
" Er - yeah , " said Harry . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" We're not discussing anything here , it's too risky , " said Moody , turning his normal eye on Harry . 
" Damn it , " he added angrily , putting a hand up to the magical eye , " it keeps getting stuck - ever since that scum wore it . " 
Harry crossed to the dishwasher , took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink , still watched eagerly by the band of wizards . 
He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down ; the eye whizzed around , staring at them all in turn . 
Harry asked . 
" Only way . 
You ' re too young to Apparate , they ' ll be watching the Floo Network and it's more than our life's worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey . " 
" Anyway , you'd better go and get packed , Harry , we want to be ready to go when the signal comes . " 
" I ' ll come and help you , " said Tonks brightly . 
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs , looking around with much curiosity and interest . 
" Funny place , " she said . 
" It's a bit too clean , d ' you know what I mean ? 
Oh , this is better , " she added , as they entered Harry's bedroom and he turned on the light . 
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house . 
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood , Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself . 
Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he'd tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside ; Hedwig's cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell ; and his trunk lay open , revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards ' robes that had spilled on to the floor around it . 
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk . 
Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door . 
" Er - " said Harry , looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland . 
She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something . 
" How did you do that ? " said Harry , gaping at her as she opened her eyes again . 
" I'm a Metamorphmagus , " she said , looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions . 
" It means I can change my appearance at will , " she added , spotting Harry's puzzled expression in the mirror behind her . 
" I was born one . 
" You ' re an Auror ? " said Harry , impressed . 
Tonks chuckled . 
He did not like people staring at his scar . 
" Well , you ' ll have to learn the hard way , I'm afraid , " said Tonks . 
Most wizards need to use a wand , or potions , to change their appearance . 
But we ' ve got to get going , Harry , we ' re supposed to be packing , " she added guiltily , looking around at all the mess on the floor . 
Books , clothes , telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pell - mell into the trunk . 
" My mums got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly - she even gets the socks to fold themselves - but I ' ve never mastered how she does it - it's a kind of flick - " She flicked her wand hopefully . 
One of Harry's socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk . 
" Ah , well , " said Tonks , slamming the trunk's lid shut , " at least it's all in . 
She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage . 
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry's right hand it was his pride and joy , a gift from Sirius , an international - standard broomstick . 
Harry's trunk rose a few inches into the air . 
Holding her wand like a conductor's baton , Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them , Hedwig's cage in her left hand . 
Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick . 
Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers . 
We should probably get out into the garden so we ' re ready . 
Harry , I ' ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry – " 
" - that you ' re safe - " 
" Do I have to ? " 
" I need to Disillusion you . " 
" You need to what ? " said Harry nervously . 
He rapped him hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there ; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck . 
Harry looked down at his body , or rather , what had been his body , for it didn't look anything like his any more . 
It was not invisible ; it had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind him . 
He seemed to have become a human chameleon . 
" Come on , " said Moody , unlocking the back door with his wand . 
Tonks ' ll be right in front of you , keep close on her tail . 
Lupin ' ll be covering you from below I'm going to be behind you . 
The rest ' ll be circling us . 
If one of us is killed - 
" Is that likely ? " 
If they take out all of us and you survive , Harry , the rear guard are standing by to take over ; keep flying east and they ' ll join you . " 
" I'm just telling the boy the plan , " growled Moody . 
" Our jobs to deliver him safely to Headquarters and if we die in the attempt – " 
" Mount your brooms , that's the first signal ! " said Lupin sharply pointing into the sky . 
Far , far above them , a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars , Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks . 
Harry kicked off hard from the ground . 
The cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away , shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks , and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head . 
He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure ; he was flying again , flying away from Privet Drive as he'd been fantasizing about all summer , he was going home … for a few glorious moments , all his problems seemed to recede to nothing , insignificant in the vast , starry sky . 
Tonks swerved and Harry followed her , watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom . 
Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon's car … the Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now , full of rage about the non - existent Lawn Competition … and Harry laughed aloud at the thought , though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others , the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage , and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air . 
He wished he had thought to put on a coat ; he was starting to shiver . 
Harry's eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache ; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before , during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year , which had taken place in a storm . 
Harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug , dry interiors of the cars streaming along below , then , even more longingly , of traveling by Floo powder ; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames … Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him , bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight … now Emmeline Vance was on his right , her wand out , her head turning left and right … then she , too , swooped over him , to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore … 
If we keep going off - course we ' re not going to get there until next week ! 
" Follow Tonks , Harry ! " 
Lower and lower they flew , until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps , chimneys and television aerials . 
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square . 
Tonks was already unbuckling Harry's trunk . 
Shivering , Harry looked around . 
The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming ; some of them had broken windows , glimmering dully in the light fro the streetlamps , paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps . 
Moody was rummaging in his cloak , his gnarled hands clumsy with cold . 
" Got it , " he muttered , raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it . 
He clicked the unlighter again ; the next lamp went out ; he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead . 
" That ' ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window , see ? 
Now come on , quick . " 
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass , across the road and on to the pavement ; Lupin and Tonks followed , carrying Harry's trunk between them , the rest of the guard , all with their wands out , flanking them . 
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house . 
A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin - bags just inside the broken gate . 
" Here , " Moody muttered , thrusting a piece of parchment towards Harry's Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it , so as to illuminate the writing . 
" Read quickly and memories . " 
Harry looked down at the piece of paper . 
It said : 
The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve , Grimmauld Place , London . 
" What's the Order of the - ? " Harry began . 
He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry's hand and set fire to it with his wand - tip . 
As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground , Harry looked around at the houses again . 
They were standing outside number eleven ; he looked to the left and saw number ten ; to the right , however , was number thirteen . 
" But where's - ? " 
Harry thought , and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve , Grimmauld Place , than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen , followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows . 
It was as though an extra house had inflated , pushing those on either side out of its way . 
Harry gaped at it . 
Harry walked up the worn stone steps , staring at the newly materialized door . 
Its black paint was shabby and scratched . 
The silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent . 
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once . 
Harry heard many loud , metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain . 
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall . 
He could smell damp , dust and a sweetish , rotting smell ; the place had the feeling of a derelict building . 
He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him , Lupin and Tonks carrying his trunk and Hedwig's cage . 
Moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the Put - Outer had stolen from the streetlamps ; they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front door , so that the darkness in the hall became complete . 
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand ; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted . 
" Now stay still , everyone , while I give us a bit of light in here , " Moody whispered . 
The others ' hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding ; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person . 
He heard a soft hissing noise and then oldfashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls , casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long , gloomy hallway , where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age - blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls . 
Harry heard something scuttling behind the baseboard . 
Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents . 
There were hurried footsteps and Ron's mother , Mrs . Weasley , emerged from a door at the far end of the hall . 
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently , " He's just arrived , the meetings started . " 
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which Mrs . Weasley had just come . 
" No , Harry , the meetings only for members of the Order . 
Ron and Hermione are upstairs , you can wait with them until the meetings over , then we ' ll have dinner . 
" I don't want anything to wake up . " 
" What d ' you - ? " 
" I ' ll explain later , I ' ve got to hurry , I'm supposed to be at the meeting - I ' ll just show you where you ' re sleeping . " 
Pressing her finger to her lips , she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long , moth - eaten curtains , behind which Harry supposed there must be another door , and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll's leg they started up the dark staircase , passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall . 
A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house - elves . 
What on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of wizards ? 
" Mrs . 
Weasley , why - ? " 
" There - " they had reached the second landing , " - you ' re the door on the right . 
I ' ll call you when it's over . " 
Harry crossed the dingy landing , turned the bedroom doorknob , which was shaped like a serpents head , and opened the door . 
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high - ceilinged , twin - bedded room ; then there was a loud twittering noise , followed by an even louder shriek , and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair . 
" HARRY ! Ron , he's here , Harry's here ! 
We didn't hear you arrive ! 
Oh , how are you ? 
Are you all right ? 
Have you been furious with us ? 
I bet you have , I know our letters were useless - but we couldn't tell you anything , Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn't , oh , we ' ve got so much to tell you , and you ' ve got things to tell us - the Dementors ! 
When we heard - and that Ministry hearing - it's just outrageous , I ' ve looked it all up , they can't expel you , they just can't , there's provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life - threatening situations - " 
He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart , making him taller and more gangly looking than ever , though the long nose , bright red hair and freckles were the same . 
Still beaming , Hermione let go of Harry , but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry's shoulder . 
" Oh , yeah , " Harry said . 
" We wanted to give them to you , mate , " said Ron . " Hermione was going spare , she kept saying you'd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news , but Dumbledore made us - " 
" - swear not to tell me , " said Harry . 
The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach . 
All of a sudden - after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone . 
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically , not looking at either of the others . 
" He seemed to think it was best , " said Hermione rather breathlessly . 
" Right , " said Harry . 
He noticed that her hands , too , bore the marks of Hedwigs beak and found that he was not at all sorry . 
" Well , no - but that's why he's had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time - " 
" Dumbledore . 
We saw him . 
When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended . 
" No , " Harry lied defiantly . 
It was dank and dark . 
A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls , and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone , who was lurking out of sight , snigger . 
But he's really busy now , we ' ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn't have much time , he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote , he said the owls might be intercepted . " 
" He could still ' ve kept me informed if he'd wanted to , " Harry said shortly . 
Hermione glanced at Ron and then said , " I thought that , too . 
" Or that I can't take care of myself . " 
" So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys ' while you two get to join in everything that's going on here ? " said Harry , the words tumbling over one another in a rush , his voice growing louder with every word . 
But before he knew it , Harry was shouting . 
Every bitter and resentful thought Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him : his frustration at the lack of news , the hurt that they had all been together without him , his fury at being followed and not told about it - all the feelings he was half - ashamed of finally burst their boundaries . 
Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again ; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads . 
Ron was standing there with his mouth half - open , clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say , while Hermione looked on the verge of tears . 
" Harry , we wanted to tell you , we really did - " Hermione began . 
" Well , he did - " 
" We wanted to - " 
" No , honest - " 
Harry glared at her , still breathing deeply , then turned away from them again , pacing up and down . 
Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe . 
There was a long pause , broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry's feet . 
" Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix , " said Ron at once . 
" Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix - ? " 
" Who's in it ? " said Harry , coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets . 
Harry glared at them . 
" Er , " said Ron . " Well what ? " 
" Voldemort ! " said Harry furiously , and both Ron and Hermione winced . 
" What's happening ? 
Where is he ? 
What are we doing to stop him ? " 
Only we ' ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk . 
Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them . 
But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on . 
We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters , keeping tabs on them , you know - " 
" Some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order - " said Hermione . 
Harry snorted . 
We ' ve managed to clean out the kitchen , most of the bedrooms and I think we ' re doing the drawing room tomo - " 
With two loud cracks , Fred and George , Ron's elder twin brothers , had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room . 
" Hello , Harry , " said George , beaming at him . 
Extendable Ears , " he added in response to Harry's raised eyebrows , and held up the string which Harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing . 
" We're trying to hear what's going on downstairs . " 
" It's worth the risk , that's a major meeting they ' re having , " said Fred . 
" I thought I heard your voice . " 
Turning to Fred and George , she said , " It's no - go with the Extendable Ears , she's gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door . " 
" You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can't make contact the door's been Imperturbed . 
I ' ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it , so there's no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap . " 
" Snape ! " said Harry quickly . 
" Is he here ? " 
" Yeah , " said George , carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds ; Fred and Ginny followed . 
" He's on our side now , " said Hermione reprovingly . 
Ron snorted . 
" Doesn't stop him being a git . 
The way he looks at us when he sees us . " 
" Bill doesn't like him , either , " said Ginny , as though that settled the matter . 
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet ; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting . 
He sank on to the bed opposite the others . 
" He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order , " said Fred . " He says he misses the tombs , but ; " he smirked , " there are compensations . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" Charlie's in the Order , too , " said George , " but he's still in Romania . 
Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible , so Charlie's trying to make contacts on his days off . " 
Harry asked . 
The last he had heard , the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Co - operation at the Ministry of Magic . 
" Why not ? " 
" Because every time Percy's name's mentioned , Dad breaks whatever he's holding and Mum starts crying , " Fred said . 
" I think we ' re well shut of him , " said George , with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face . 
" What's happened ? " 
Harry said . 
" It was the first week back after term ended , " said Ron . " We were about to come and join the Order . 
" You ' re kidding ? " said Harry . 
Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious , Harry's impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic . 
Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort ( not that the Ministry had believed it - they all thought Mr . Crouch had gone mad ) . 
" He came home really pleased with himself - even more pleased than usual , if you can imagine that - and told Dad he'd been offered a position in Fudge's own office . 
A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts : Junior Assistant to the Minister . 
" Why not ? " said Harry . 
" Trouble is , Fudge suspects Dad , he knows he's friendly with Dumbledore , and he's always thought Dad's a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession . " 
" I'm coming to that . 
Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family - and Dumbledore . " 
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way . 
He said - well , he said loads of terrible stuff . 
He said he's been having to struggle against Dad's lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad's got no ambition and that's why we ' ve always been - you know - not had a lot of money , I mean - " 
" And it got worse . 
He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore , that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him , and that he - Percy - knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry . 
And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn't belong to our family any more . 
And he packed his bags the same night and left . 
He's living here in London now . " 
He had always liked Percy least of Ron's brothers , but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr . Weasley . 
She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face . 
I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work - ignores him , I s ' pose . " 
" But Percy must know Voldemort's back , " said Harry s lowly . 
" Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously , " said Hermione tartly , and the others all nodded . 
Harry asked , looking around at them all . 
" Yeah , I have ! " said Harry . 
The others flinched at the sound of the name . 
Hermione hurried on , " Well , you'd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up , but they - um - they mention you a couple of times a week . " 
" I'm not talking about big articles . 
" What d ' you - ? " 
" It's quite nasty , actually , " said Hermione in a voice of forced calm . 
" Which is what ? " said Harry impatiently . 
" Okay , you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that ? " 
" I know , Harry . 
But you see what they ' re doing ? 
They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe . 
Fudge is behind it , I ' ll bet anything . 
Harry spluttered . 
Who wants to be famous for that ? 
" We know , Harry , " said Ginny earnestly . 
" And of course , they didn't report a word about the Dementors attacking you , " said Hermione . 
We think they ' re biding their time until you ' re expelled , then they ' re really going to go to town - I mean , if you ' re expelled , obviously , " she went on hastily . 
They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that . 
He cast around for another change of subject , but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs . 
" Uh oh . " 
" The meeting's over , you can come down and have dinner now . 
Everyone's dying to see you , Harry . 
Now don't forget to keep your voices down in the hall . 
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room , leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione . 
Both of them were watching him apprehensively , as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone . 
" Look … " he muttered , but Ron shook his head , and Hermione said quietly , " We knew you'd be angry , Harry , we really don't blame you , but you ' ve got to understand , we did try to persuade Dumbledore - " 
" Yeah , I know , " said Harry shortly . 
Hermione frowned at Ron . 
" He's not a nutter , Ron . " 
" His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother , " said Ron irritably . 
" Is that normal , Hermione ? " 
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry . 
" It's the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare . 
He led the way out of the door and on to the landing , but before they could descend the stairs - 
" Hold it ! " 
" They're still in the hall , we might be able to hear something . " 
The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards , including all of Harry's guard . 
In the very center of the group Harry saw the dark , greasy - haired head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts , Professor Snape . 
Harry leaned further over the banisters . 
He was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix … 
A thin piece of flesh - colored string descended in front of Harry's eyes . 
Looking up , he saw Fred and George on the landing above , cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear towards the dark knot of people below . 
A moment later , however , they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight . 
They heard the front door open , then close . 
" Snape never eats here , " Ron told Harry quietly . 
" And don't forget to keep your voice down in the hall , Harry , " Hermione whispered . 
As they passed the row of house - elf heads on the wall , they saw Lupin , Mrs . Weasley and Tonks at the front door , magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left . 
" We're eating down in the kitchen , " Mrs . Weasley whispered , meeting them at the bottom of the stairs . 
" It's that stupid umbrella stand , that's the second time I ' ve tripped over - " 
The moth - eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart , but there was no door behind them . 
For a split second , Harry thought he was looking through a window , a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured - then he realized it was simply a life - size portrait , but the most realiztic , and the most unpleasant , he had ever seen in his life . 
The old woman was drooling , her eyes were rolling , the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed ; and all along the hall behind them , the other portraits awoke and began to yell , too , so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears . 
Lupin and Mrs . Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman , but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever , brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces . 
Tonks apologized over and over again , dragging the huge , heavy troll's leg back off the floor ; Mrs . Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall , stunning all the other portraits with her wand ; and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry . 
" Yoooou ! " she howled , her eyes popping at the sight of the man . 
" I said - shut - UP ! " roared the man , and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again . 
The old woman's screeches died and an echoing silence fell . 
Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes , Harry's godfather Sirius turned to face him . 
CHAPTER FIVE : The Order of the Phoenix 
" Your - ? " 
" We ' ve been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas . 
Harry asked , bewildered , as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps , the others just behind them . 
I offered it to Dumbledore for Headquarters - about the only useful thing I ' ve been able to do . " 
He followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen . 
It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above , a cavernous room with rough stone walls . 
Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room . 
A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes , through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling . 
Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them , littered with rolls of parchment , goblets , empty wine bottles , and a heap of what appeared to be rags . 
Mr . Weasley and his eldest son Bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table . 
Mrs . Weasley cleared her throat . 
" Harry ! " 
" Good to see you ! " 
Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill , who still wore his long hair in a ponytail , hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table . 
" He tried , " said Tonks , striding over to help Bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment . 
" Here , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley , sounding exasperated , and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand . 
In the flash of light caused by Mrs . Weasley's charm Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building . 
She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill's already overladen arms . 
Ginny giggled . 
" Harry's arrived . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets , still staring at Harry , and pulled out a grimy black pipe . 
He stuck it in his mouth , ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it . 
" Owe you a ' pology , " grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud . 
" For the last time , Mundungus , " called Mrs . Weasley , " will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen , especially not when we ' re about to eat ! " 
" And if you want dinner before midnight I ' ll need a hand , " Mrs . Weasley said to the room at large . 
" No , you can stay where you are , Harry dear , you ' ve had a long journey . " 
Soon , a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord , supervised by Mr . Weasley , while Mrs . Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates , more goblets and food from the pantry . 
Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus , who was still blinking at him mournfully . 
Harry felt something brush against his knees and started , but it was only Crookshanks , Hermione's bandy - legged ginger cat , who wound himself once around Harry's legs , purring , then jumped on to Sirius's lap and curled up . 
" No , it's been lousy , " said Harry . 
For the first time , something like a grin flitted across Sirius's face . 
" Don't know what you ' re complaining about , myself . " 
" What ? " said Harry incredulously . 
There's not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix … or so Dumbledore feels . " 
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius , too , was not very happy with the Headmaster . 
" At least you ' ve known what's been going on , " he said bracingly . 
" What cleaning ? " 
asked Harry . 
Mrs . Weasley shrieked . 
Harry , Sirius and Mundungus looked round and , a split second later , they had dived away from the table . 
Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew , an iron flagon of Butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard , complete with knife , to hurtle through the air towards them . 
The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end , leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface ; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash , spilling its contents everywhere ; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed , point down and quivering ominously , exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before . 
" FOR HEAVEN ' S SAKE ! " screamed Mrs . Weasley . 
" We were just trying to save a bit of time ! " said Fred , hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table . 
Harry and Sirius were both laughing ; Mundungus , who had toppled backwards off his chair , was swearing as he got to his feet ; Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser , from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness . 
" Boys , " Mr . Weasley said , lifting the stew back into the middle of the table , " your mother's right , you ' re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you ' ve come of age - " 
Mrs . Weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of Butterbeer on to the table , and spilling almost as much again . 
Percy - " 
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food . 
Then Mrs . Weasley turned to Sirius . 
" I ' ve been meaning to tell you , Sirius , there's something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room , it keeps rattling and shaking . 
Of course , it could just be a Boggart , but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out . " 
" I look forward to it , " said Sirius . 
Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice , but he was not sure that anyone else did . 
Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom , her nose swelled to a beak - like protuberance that resembled Snape's , shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril . 
Tonks obliged , and Harry , looking up , had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table . 
Mr . Weasley , Bill and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins . 
" They're not giving anything away yet , " said Bill . " I still can't work out whether or not they believe he's back . 
" And I'm not talking about gold . 
" He's feeling pretty anti - wizard at the moment , " said Bill , " he hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business , he reckons the Ministry did a cover - up , those goblins never got their gold from him , you know - " 
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words . 
" Beg pardon , Molly , " said Mundungus at once , wiping his eyes and winking at Harry . 
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer ; George was hiccoughing . 
Harry looked round at his godfather . 
" How come he's in the Order ? " 
Harry said , very quietly . 
" Knows all the crooks - well , he would , seeing as he's one himself . 
But he's also very loyal to Dumbledore , who helped him out of a tight spot once . 
But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far . 
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight ( which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley's ) . 
As he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation : Mr . Weasley was leaning back in his chair , looking replete and relaxed ; Tonks was yawning widely , her nose now back to normal ; and Ginny who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser , was sitting crosslegged on the floor , rolling Butterbeer corks for him to chase . 
" You know , I'm surprised at you . 
I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort . " 
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of Dementors . 
A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort's name . 
" I did ! " said Harry indignantly . 
" Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions ? " asked Sirius . 
" Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month . 
He's got the right to know what's been happen — " 
" We ' ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven't told us a single stinking thing ! " said George . 
" It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing , " said Sirius calmly , " that's your parents'decision . 
Harry , on the other hand - " 
" It's not down to you to decide what's good for Harry ! " said Mrs . Weasley sharply . 
" Which bit ? " Sirius asked politely , but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight . 
" The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know , " said Mrs . Weasley , placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words . 
" I don't intend to tell him more than he needs to know , Molly , " said Sirius . 
" But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back " ( again , there was a collective shudder around the table at the name ) " he has more right than most to - " 
" He's not a member of the Order of the Phoenix ! " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" No one's denying what he's done ! " said Mrs . Weasley , her voice rising , her fists trembling on the arms of her chair . 
" But he's still - " 
" He's not a child ! " said Sirius impatiently . 
" He's not James , Sirius ! " 
" I'm perfectly clear who he is , thanks , Molly , " said Sirius coldly . 
" I'm not sure you are ! " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Sometimes , the way you talk about him , it's as though you think you ' ve got your best friend back ! " 
" What's wrong with that ? " said Harry . 
" Meaning I'm an irresponsible godfather ? " 
" Arthur ! " said Mrs . Weasley , rounding on her husband . 
Mr . Weasley did not speak at once . 
Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply . 
He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in , to a certain extent , now that he is staying at Headquarters . " 
" Personally , " said Lupin quietly , looking away from Sirius at last , as Mrs . Weasley turned quickly to him , hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally , " I think it better that Harry gets the facts - not all the facts , Molly , but the general picture - from us , rather than a garbled version from … others . " 
I ' ll just say this : Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much , and speaking as someone who has Harry's best interests at heart - " 
" He's not your son , " said Sirius quietly . 
" He's as good as , " said Mrs . Weasley fiercely . 
" He's got me ! " 
Mrs . Weasley's lower lip was trembling . 
" I want to know what's been going on , " Harry said at once . 
He did not look at Mrs . Weasley . 
Sirius was right , he was not a child . 
Mrs . Weasley was now scarlet in the face . 
" Harry ' ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway ! " said Ron hotly . 
For a split second , Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn't tell him a single word , that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it . 
" Course I will , " Harry said . 
Ron and Hermione beamed . 
" Fine ! " shouted Mrs . Weasley . 
Ginny - BED ! " 
Ginny did not go quietly . 
They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs , and when she reached the hall Mrs . Blacks ear - splitting shrieks were added to the din . 
Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm . 
It was only after he had returned , closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again , that Sirius spoke . 
" Okay , Harry … what do you want to know ? " 
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month . 
" Where's Voldemort ? " he said , ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name . 
" What's he doing ? 
Harry asked . 
He messed it up . " 
" How ? " Harry asked , perplexed . 
" And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore , " said Lupin . 
Harry asked . 
" Are you kidding ? " said Bill incredulously . 
" Dumbledore was the only one You - Know - Who was ever scared of ! " 
" Thanks to you , Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned , " said Sirius . 
" How d ' you know what his plans are ? " 
Harry asked quickly . 
You heard him planning to recruit the giants ; well , they ' ll be just one of the groups he's after . 
" How ? " 
" Because of the Ministry's attitude , " said Tonks . 
He's absolutely refusing to believe it's happened . " 
If Dumbledore - " 
" Dumbledore . " 
" Fudge thinks Dumbledore's plotting to overthrow him . 
Fudge came to power instead , but he's never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had , even though Dumbledore never applied for the job . " 
" Deep down , Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than he is - a much more powerful wizard , and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice , " said Lupin . 
" But it seems he's become fond of power , and much more confident . 
He loves being Minister for Magic and he's managed to convince himself that he's the clever one and Dumbledore's simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it . " 
" While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort it's hard to convince people he's back , especially as they really don't want to believe it in the first place . 
What's more , the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they ' re calling Dumbledore's rumor - mongering , so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware any things happened , and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they ' re using the Imperius Curse . " 
" Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off , " said Sirius , " and it's very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry , because you can bet Voldemort will have them . " 
" We ' ve managed to convince a couple of people , though , " said Mr . Weasley , " Tonks here , for one - she's too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time , and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage - Kingsley Shacklebolt's been a real asset , too ; he's in charge of the hunt for Sirius , so he's been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet . " 
" Why d ' you think Dumbledore's in such trouble ? " 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
Harry asked . 
" Didn't you see the Daily Prophet last week ? 
They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip , but it's not true ; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemorts return . 
" If he carries on defying the Ministry like this he could end up in Azkaban , and the last thing we want is to have Dumbledore locked up . 
While You - Know - Who knows Dumbledore's out there and wise to what he's up to he's going to go cautiously . 
" But if Voldemort's trying to recruit more Death Eaters it's bound to get out that he's come back , isn't it ? " 
asked Harry desperately . 
Harry asked swiftly . 
He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius answered . 
" When he was powerful before ? " 
" Yes . " 
" Something worse than the Avada Kedavra - ? " 
" That's enough ! " 
Mrs . Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door . 
Her arms were crossed and she looked furious . 
" I want you in bed , now . 
All of you , " she added , looking around at Fred , George , Ron and Hermione . 
She was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius . 
" Why not ? " said Harry quickly . 
" I ' ll join , I want to join , I want to fight . " 
" No . " 
It was not Mrs . 
Mrs . Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione . 
One by one they stood up and Harry , recognizing defeat , followed suit . 
" I want you all to go straight to bed , no talking , " she said as they reached the first landing , " we ' ve got a busy day tomorrow . 
I expect Ginny's asleep , " she added to Hermione , " so try not to wake her up . " 
" Asleep , yeah , right , " said Fred in an undertone , after Hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor . 
" If Ginny's not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then I'm a Flobberworm … " 
" Night , " Harry and Ron said to the twins . 
Mrs . Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap . 
The bedroom looked , if anything , even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight . 
The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply , as though its invisible occupant was asleep . 
Harry put on his pajamas , took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon , who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly . 
He crossed to the door and bolted it . 
" Kreacher , " said Ron as he turned off the light . 
" First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning . 
Trust me , you don't want to wake up and find him prowling around your room . 
Anyway … " he got into his bed , settled down under the covers then turned to look at Harry in the darkness ; Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window , " what d ' you reckon ? " 
" I mean , all they ' ve really said is that the Order's trying to stop people joining Vol — " 
" — demort , " said Harry firmly . 
Sirius and Lupin do . " 
" Yeah , well , it's harder in the dark . " 
Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ron's bed . 
There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry's mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet . 
" But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra Curse , can there ? " said Ron . " What's worse than death ? " 
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others , like him , were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate . 
" I hope it's our side , " said Ron , sounding slightly nervous . 
" If it is , Dumbledore's probably keeping it , " said Fred . 
" That's where he hid the Sorcerer's Stone . " 
" Listen ! " 
Footsteps were coming up the stairs . 
" Mum , " said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed . 
A few seconds later , they heard the floorboard creak outside their door ; Mrs . Weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking . 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully . 
The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George . 
" She doesn't trust us at all , you know , " said Ron regretfully . 
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep ; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over . 
He wanted to continue talking to Ron , but Mrs . Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again , and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs … in fact , many - legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door , and Hagrid the Care of Magical Creatures teacher was saying , " Beauties , arn'they , eh , Harry ? 
We ' ll be studyin ' weapons this term … " and Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him … he ducked … 
The next thing he knew , he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and Georges loud voice was filling the room . 
" Mum says get up , your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room , there are loads more Doxys than she thought and she's found a nest of dead Puffskeins under the sofa . " 
Half an hour later Harry and Ron , who had dressed and breakfasted quickly , entered the drawing room , a long , high - ceilinged room on the first floor with olive green walls covered in dirty tapestries . 
The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long , moss green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees . 
It was around these that Mrs . Weasley , Hermione , Ginny , Fred and George were grouped , all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth . 
Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with anozzle at the end . 
" Cover your faces and take a spray , " Mrs . Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them , pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle - legged table . 
" It's Doxycide . 
He dropped the bag of rats into an armchair , then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which , Harry now noticed for the first time , was shaking slightly . 
" Well , Molly , I'm pretty sure this is a Boggart , " said Sirius , peering through the keyhole , " but perhaps we ought to let Mad - Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out - knowing my mother , it could be something much worse . " 
" Right you are , Sirius , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
A loud , clanging bell sounded from downstairs , followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand . 
" I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell ! " said Sirius exasperatedly , hurrying out of the room . 
They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs . Black's screeches echoed up through the house once more : 
" Close the door , please , Harry , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing - room door ; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs . 
He heard Sirius walking down the hall , then the clattering of the chain on the front door , and then a deep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt's saying , " Hestia's just relieved me , so she's got Moody's Cloak now , thought I'd leave a report for Dumbledore … " 
Feeling Mrs . Weasley's eyes on the back of his head , Harry regretfully closed the drawing - room door and rejoined the Doxy party . 
Mrs . Weasley was bending over to check the page on Doxys in Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests , which was lying open on the sofa . 
Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide . 
It froze in midair and fell , with a surprisingly loud hunk , on to the worn carpet below . 
Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket . 
" Fred , what are you doing ? " said Mrs . Weasley sharply . 
" Spray that at once and throw it away ! " 
Harry looked round . 
Fred was holding a struggling Doxy between his forefinger and thumb . 
" Right - o , ' Fred said brightly , spraying the Doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted , but the moment Mrs . Weasley's back was turned he pocketed it with a wink . 
If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles , you throw up . 
Moment you ' ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing , you swallow the purple half – " 
" which restores you to full fitness , enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom . 
That's what we ' re putting in the adverts , anyway , " whispered Fred , who had edged over out of Mrs . Weasley's line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray Doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket . 
At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end . " 
George did the Fainting Fancies - we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat - " 
Harry muttered , pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray . 
" Well , we haven't had a chance to get premises yet , " said Fred , dropping his voice even lower as Mrs . Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack , " so we ' re running it as a mail - order service at the moment . 
We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week . " 
She won't read the Daily Prophet any more , ' cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore . " 
Harry grinned . 
He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand Galleons prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop , but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs . Weasley . 
She did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons . 
The de - Doxying of the curtains took most of the morning . 
It was past midday when Mrs . Weasley finally removed her protective scarf , sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust , having sat on the bag of dead rats . 
At the foot of them unconscious Doxys lay crammed in the bucket beside a bowl of their black eggs , at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks . 
Mrs . Weasley pointed at the dusty glass - fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece . 
They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects : a selection of rusty daggers , claws , a coiled snakeskin , a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and , least pleasant of all , an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper , full of what Harry was quite sure was blood . 
The clanging doorbell rang again . 
Everyone looked at Mrs . Weasley . 
She left the room , closing the door carefully behind her . 
At once , everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep . 
They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons . 
" Isn't that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me ? 
" Yeah , you ' re right ! " said Fred , as the front door opened ; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view . 
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it , listening closely . 
All of them could hear exactly what Mrs . Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice . 
" I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else , " said Fred , with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs . Weasley's voice to permeate the room better , " it makes such a nice change . " 
And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you , Harry - and there goes Sirius's mum again . " 
Mrs . Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall . 
George made to shut the door to drown the noise , but before he could do so , a house - elf edged into the room . 
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle , it was completely naked . 
It looked very old . 
Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and , though it was bald like all house - elves , there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large , batlike ears . 
Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike . 
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest . 
Acting as though it could not see them , it shuffled hunchbacked , slowly and doggedly , towards the far end of the room , all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse , deep voice like a bullfrogs . 
" … smells like a drain and a criminal to boot , but she's no better , nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress's house , oh , my poor mistress , if she knew , if she knew the scum they ' ve let into her house , what would she say to old Kreacher , oh , the shame of it , Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves , poor old Kreacher , what can he do … " 
" Kreacher said nothing , " said the elf , with a second bow to George , adding in a clear undertone , " and there's its twin , unnatural little beasts they are . " 
The elf straightened up , eyeing them all malevolently , and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter . 
" … and there's the Mudblood , standing there bold as brass , oh , if my mistress knew , oh , how she'd cry , and there's a new boy , Kreacher doesn't know his name . 
What is he doing here ? 
" Harry Potter . " 
Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever . 
Kreacher was still muttering , his eyes on Harry . 
" Is it true ? 
Is it Harry Potter ? Kreacher can see t he scar , it must be true , that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord , Kreacher wonders how he did it - " 
" What do you want , anyway ? " 
" Kreacher is cleaning , " he said evasively . 
Sirius had come back ; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway . 
The noise in the hall had abated ; perhaps Mrs . Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen . 
At the sight of Sirius , Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor . 
" Kreacher is cleaning , " the elf repeated . 
" Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black - " 
" And it's getting blacker every day , it's filthy , " said Sirius . 
" Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots , oh , my poor mistress , what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him , how she hated him , what a disappointment he was - " 
" I asked you what you were up to , " said Sirius coldly . 
" Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house , " said the elf , then muttered very fast , " Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out , seven centuries it's been in the family , Kreacher must save it , Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it - " 
" She ' ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it , I don't doubt , but if I can get rid of it I certainly will . 
It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order ; nevertheless , the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room . 
" - comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around , oh , my poor mistress , what would she say if she saw the house now , scum living in it , her treasures thrown out , she swore he was no son of hers and he's back , they say he's a murderer too - " 
" Keep muttering and I will be a murderer ! " said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf . 
" Sirius , he's not right in the head , " Hermione pleaded , " I don't think he realizes we can hear him . " 
" He's been alone too long , " said Sirius , " taking mad orders from my mother's portrait and talking to himself , but he was always a foul little - " 
You suggest to him that he leaves this house , see how he takes it . " 
Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall . 
Harry and the others followed . 
The tapestry looked immensely old ; it was faded and looked as though Doxys had gnawed it in places . 
Nevertheless , the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back ( as far as Harry could tell ) to the 
Large words at the very top of the tapestry read : 
" You ' re not on here ! " said Harry , after scanning the bottom of the tree closely . 
" Where did you go ? " asked Harry , staring at him . 
Yeah , I camped out at your dad's in the school holidays , and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own . 
" But … why did you … ? " 
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree , at the name Regulus Black . 
" He was younger than me , " said Sirius , " and a much better son , as I was constantly reminded . " 
" No , no , but believe me , they thought Voldemort had the right idea , they were all for the purification of the wizarding race , getting rid of Muggle - borns and having pure - bloods in charge . 
They weren't alone , either , there were quite a few people , before Voldemort showed his true colors , who thought he had the right idea about things … they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power , though . 
Harry asked tentatively . 
From what I found out after he died , he got in so far , then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out . 
It's a lifetime of service or death . " 
She was holding her wand high in front of her , balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip . 
She was very red in the face and still looked angry . 
There's Phineas Nigellus … my great - great - grandfather , see ? … least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had … and Araminta Mehflua … cousin of my mothers … tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle - hunting legal … and dear Aunt Elladora … she started the family tradition of beheading house - elves when they got too old to carry tea trays … of course , any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned . 
I see Tonks isn't on here . 
Maybe that's why Kreacher won't take orders from her - he's supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him - " 
Harry asked , surprised . 
" No , Andromeda's not on here either , look - " 
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names , Bellatrix and Narcissa . 
" Andromeda's sisters are still here because they made lovely , respectable pure - blood marriages , but Andromeda married a Muggle - born , Ted Tonks , so - " 
Harry , however , did not laugh ; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda's burn mark . 
A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco . 
" You ' re related to the Malfoys ! " 
Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur's something like my second cousin once removed . 
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda's burn : Bellatrix Black , which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange . 
" Lestrange … " Harry said aloud . 
The name had stirred something in his memory ; he knew it from somewhere , but for a moment he couldn't think where , though it gave him an odd , creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach . 
Harry looked at him curiously . 
" Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch junior , " said Sirius , in the same brusque voice . 
Then Harry remembered . 
He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore's Pensieve , the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored : a tall dark woman with heavylidded eyes , who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort , her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty . 
She's certainly not my family . 
D ' you think I'm proud of having a relative like her ? " 
" Sorry , " said Harry quickly , " I didn't mean - I was just surprised , that's all - " 
He turned away from the tapestry , his hands deep in his pockets . 
" I don't like being back here , " he said , staring across the drawing room . 
Harry understood completely . 
He knew how he would feel , when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever , to return and live at number four , Privet Drive . 
It's unplottable , so Muggles could never come and call - as if they'd ever have wanted to - and now Dumbledore's added his protection , you'd be hard put to find a safer house anywhere . 
Dumbledore is Secret Keeper for the Order , you know – nobody can find Headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is - that note Moody showed you last night , that was from Dumbledore … " Sirius gave a short , bark - like laugh . 
I ' ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing - as Snuffles , obviously - so I can give you a bit of moral support , what d ' you think ? " 
He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening ; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best , and hearing everything that was going on , it had completely flown his mind . 
At Sirius's words , however , the crushing sense of dread returned to him . 
He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys , all tucking into their sandwiches , and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him . 
Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him . 
" But if they do expel me , " said Harry quietly , " can I come back here and live with you ? " 
" I'd feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn't have to go back to the Dursleys , " Harry pressed him . 
" Hurry up , you two , or there won't be any food left , " Mrs . Weasley called . 
Sirius heaved another great sigh , cast a dark look at the tapestry , then he and Harry went to join the others . 
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass - fronted cabinets that afternoon . 
Fortunately for him , it was a job that required a lot of concentration , as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves . 
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets ; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already Doxy - filled pocket . 
They found an unpleasant - looking silver instrument , something like a many - legged pair of tweezers , which scuttled up Harry's arm like a spider when he picked it up , and attempted to puncture his skin . 
Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility : A Wizarding Genealogy . 
There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister , tinkling tune when wound , and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy , until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut ; a heavy locket that none of them could open ; a number of ancient seals ; and , in a dusty box , an Order of Merlin , First Class , that had been awarded to Sirius's grandfather for services to the Ministry . 
" It means he gave them a load of gold , " said Sirius contemptuously , throwing the medal into the rubbish sack . 
Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth , muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it . 
" It was my father's , " said Sirius , throwing the ring into the sack . 
The drawing room took three days to decontaminate . 
Finally , the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree , which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall , and the rattling writing desk . 
They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser ( Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half ) . 
The china , which bore the Black crest and motto , was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius , and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames , all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed . 
The house - elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated , his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks . 
Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes , but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said , " Master must do as Master wishes , " before turning away and muttering very loudly , " but Master will not turn Kreacher away , no , because Kreacher knows what they are up to , oh yes , he is plotting against the Dark Lord , yes , with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum … " At which Sirius , ignoring Hermione's protests , seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room . 
The doorbell rang several times a day , which was the cue for Sirius's mother to start shrieking again , and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor , though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs . Weasley recalled them to their tasks . 
Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more , though to Harry's relief they never came face to face ; Harry also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall , looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat , and she also seemed too busy to linger . 
Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet , and Lupin , who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order , helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers - by . 
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs . Weasley's eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe . 
Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly , still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle , Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer . 
As long as he was busy he was happy ; when the action abated , however , whenever he dropped his guard , or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling , the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him . 
Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled . 
The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud , not even to Ron and Hermione , who , though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction , followed his lead in not mentioning it . 
Sometimes , he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys ' … but he would not go . 
He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius . 
He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs . Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly , " I ' ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning , Harry , and I want you to wash your hair tonight , too . 
Ron , Hermione , Fred , George and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him . 
Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops , but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew . 
" How am I getting there ? " he asked Mrs . Weasley , trying to sound unconcerned . 
" Arthurs taking you to work with him , " said Mrs . Weasley gently . 
Mr . Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table . 
" You can wait in my office until it's time for the hearing , " he said . 
Harry looked over at Sirius , but before he could ask the question , Mrs . Weasley had answered it . 
" Professor Dumbledore doesn't think it's a good idea for Sirius to go with you , and I must say I " 
" think he's quite right , " said Sirius through clenched teeth . 
Mrs . Weasley pursed her lips . 
" He came last night , when you were in bed , " said Mr . Weasley . 
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork . 
Harry lowered his own eyes to his plate . 
The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel , if it were possible , even worse . 
CHAPTER SEVEN : The Ministry of Magic 
Harry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear . 
For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain , then , unable to bear it , he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses . 
Mrs . Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T - shirt at the foot of his bed . 
Harry scrambled into them . 
The blank picture on the wall sniggered . 
Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open , fast asleep . 
He did not stir as Harry crossed the room , stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him . 
Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron , when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts , Harry walked quietly down the stairs , past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors , and down into the kitchen . 
He had expected it to be empty , but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side . 
He pushed it open and saw Mr . and Mrs . Weasley , Sirius , Lupin and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him . 
All were fully dressed except Mrs . Weasley , who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown . 
" Breakfast , " she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Come and sit down … " 
She drew out a chair , knocking over the one beside it in the process . 
" What do you want , Harry ? " 
Mrs . Weasley called . 
Bacon and eggs ? 
" Just - just toast , thanks , " said Harry . 
Lupin glanced at Harry , then said to Tonks , " What were you saying about Scrimgeour ? " 
" Oh … yeah … well , we need to be a bit more careful , he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions … " 
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation . 
Mrs . Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him ; he tried to eat , but it was like chewing carpet . 
Mrs . Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T - shirt , tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders . 
He wished she wouldn't . 
" … and I ' ll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow , I'm just too tired , " Tonks finished , yawning hugely again . 
" I ' ll cover for you , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" I'm okay , I ' ve got a report to finish anyway . " 
Mr . Weasley was not wearing wizards ' robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket . 
He turned from Tonks to Harry . 
" How are you feeling ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
Harry said nothing . 
She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , and the one who ' ll be questioning you . " 
Harry nodded , still unable to think of anything to say . 
" Be polite and stick to the facts . " 
Harry nodded again . 
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck ; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him , then he realized that Mrs . Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb . 
She pressed hard on the top of his head . 
Harry shook his head . 
Mr . Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry . 
" I think we ' ll go now , " he said . 
" Okay , " said Harry automatically , dropping his toast and getting to his feet . 
" And if it's not , " said Sirius grimly " I ' ll see to Amelia Bones for you … " 
Harry smiled weakly . 
Mrs . Weasley hugged him . 
" Right , " said Harry . 
He followed Mr . Weasley upstairs and along the hall . 
He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains . 
Mr . Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold , grey dawn . 
Harry asked him , as they set off briskly around the square . 
Mr . Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked . 
Harry knew it was clenched around his wand . 
The run - down streets were almost deserted , but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already full of early - morning commuters . 
" They're out of order , " said Harry , pointing at the sign . 
" Yes , but even so … " said Mr . Weasley , beaming at them fondly 
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy - looking guard ( Harry handled the transaction , as Mr . Weasley was not very good with Muggle money ) and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the center of London . 
Mr . Weasley kept anxiously checking and re - checking the Underground Map above the windows . 
They got off at a station in the very heart of London , and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases . 
Up the escalator they went , through the ticket barrier ( Mr . Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket ) , and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing - looking buildings and already full of traffic . 
" Where are we ? " said Mr . Weasley blankly , and for one heart - stopping moment Harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr . Weasley's continual references to the map ; but a second later he said , " Ah yes … this way , Harry , " and led him down a side road . 
" Sorry , " he said , " but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective . 
The further they walked , the smaller and less imposing the buildings became , until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby - looking offices , a pub and an overflowing dumpster . 
Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic . 
" After you , Harry . " 
He opened the telephone - box door . 
Harry stepped inside , wondering what on earth this was about . 
Mr . Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door . 
It was a tight fit ; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus , which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off . 
Mr . Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver . 
" Mr . 
" No , no , I'm sure it's fine , " said Mr . Weasley , holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial . 
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place , a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box , not from the receiver in Mr . Weasley's hand , but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them . 
" Welcome to the Ministry of Magic . 
He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear , " Arthur Weasley , Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office , here to escort Harry Potter , who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing … " 
" Visitor , please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes . " 
There was a click and a rattle , and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared . 
He picked it up : it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter , Disciplinary Hearing on it . 
He pinned it to the front of his T - shirt as the female voice spoke again . 
" Visitor to the Ministry , you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk , which is located at the far end of the Atrium . " 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered . 
They were sinking slowly into the ground . 
Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads . 
Then he could see nothing at all ; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth . 
After about a minute , though it felt much longer to Harry , a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and , widening , rose up his body , until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering . 
The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr . Weasley stepped out of it , followed by Harry , whose mouth had fallen open . 
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished , dark wood floor . 
Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left - hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh . 
Halfway down the hall was a fountain . 
A group of golden statues , larger than life - size , stood in the middle of a circular pool . 
Tallest of them all was a noble - looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air . 
Grouped around him were a beautiful witch , a centaur , a goblin and a house - elf . 
Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of their wands , the point of the centaur's arrow , the tip of the goblins hat and each of the house - elf's ears , so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards , most of whom were wearing glum , early - morning looks , strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall . 
" This way , " said Mr . Weasley . 
They joined the throng , wending their way between the Ministry workers , some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment , others battered briefcases ; still others were reading the Daily Prophet while they walked . 
As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool . 
" Over here , Harry , " said Mr . Weasley , and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates . 
Seated at a desk to the left , beneath a sign saying Security , a badly shaven wizard in peacock blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet . 
" I'm escorting a visitor , " said Mr . Weasley , gesturing towards Harry . 
" Step over here , " said the wizard in a bored voice . 
Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod , thin and flexible as a car aerial , and passed it up and down Harry's front and back . 
" Wand , " grunted the security wizard at Harry , putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand . 
Harry produced his wand . 
The wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument , which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish . 
It began to vibrate . 
A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base . 
" Yes , " said Harry nervously . 
" I keep this , " said the wizard , impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike . 
His eyes had darted from the silver visitors badge on Harry's chest to his forehead . 
" Thank you , Eric , " said Mr . Weasley firmly , and grasping Harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates . 
Jostled slightly by the crowd , Harry followed Mr . Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond , where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles . 
Harry and Mr . Weasley joined the crowd around one of them . 
" All right , Arthur ? " said the wizard , nodding at Mr . Weasley . 
" What ' ve you got there , Bob ? " asked Mr . Weasley , looking at the box . 
Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me . " 
With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them ; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr . Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall . 
The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly , chains rattling , while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again . 
" Level Seven , Department of Magical Games and Sports , incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters , Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office . " 
One of the wizards in the lift , who was carrying an armful of broomsticks , extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor . 
The doors closed , the lift juddered upwards again and the woman's voice announced : 
Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out ; at the same time , several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift . 
" We used to use owls , but the mess was unbelievable … droppings all over the desks … " 
As they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the lift's ceiling . 
" Level Five , Department of International Magical Co - operation , incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body , the International Magical Office of Law and the International Confederation of Wizards , British Seats . " 
When the doors opened , two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards , but several more memos zoomed in , so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it . 
Beast , Being and Spirit Divisions , Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau . " 
" S ' cuse , " said the wizard carrying the fire - breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos . 
Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr . Weasley , Harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor . 
The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again , then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement . 
" Level Two , Department of Magical Law Enforcement , including the Improper Use of Magic Office , Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services . " 
" This is us , Harry , " said Mr . Weasley , and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors . 
" My office is on the other side o f the floor . " 
" Mr . 
" Yes , we are , " said Mr . Weasley . 
Magical Maintenance decide what weather we ' ll get every day . 
They turned a corner , walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles , which was buzzing with talk and laughter . 
Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed . 
The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families , to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet . 
A scarlet - robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk , dictating a report to his quill . 
A little further along , a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt . 
" I ' ve been wanting a word with you , have you got a second ? " 
" Yes , if it really is a second , " said Mr . Weasley , " I'm in rather a hurry . " 
They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley , Mr . Weasley stood on his foot . 
They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle . 
Newspaper cuttings and old photographs - even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters ' wedding - papered the walls . 
The only Sirius - free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels . 
" I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months . 
He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle , through a second set of oak doors , into another passage , turned left , marched along another corridor , turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor , and finally reached a dead end , where a door on the left stood ajar , revealing a broom cupboard , and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading : Misuse of Muggle Artifacts . 
Mr . Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard . 
Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls , on top of which were tottering piles of files . 
The little wall space available bore witness to Mr . Weasley's obsessions : several posters of cars , including one of a dismantled engine ; two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books ; and a diagram showing how to wire a plug . 
Sitting on top of Mr . Weasley's overflowing in - tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs . 
A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in - tray . 
" We haven't got a window , " said Mr . Weasley apologetically , taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair . 
Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins's desk while Mr . Weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him . 
" Ah , " he said , grinning , as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst , " yes … " He flicked through it . 
A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster . 
Mr . Weasley unfolded it and read it aloud . 
" We had two last week , one in Wimbledon , one in Elephant and Castle . 
Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing - well , you can imagine . 
The poor things keep calling in those - pumbles , I think they ' re called - you know , the ones who mend pipes and things . " 
" I know about the regurgitating toilet , " said Mr . Weasley . 
" No , no , it's not the toilet , it's the Potter boy's hearing - they ' ve changed the time and venue - it starts at eight o ' clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten - " 
Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr . Weasley left the office at a run , Harry close on his heels . 
" Why have they changed the time ? " 
Mr . Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the'down ' button . 
" Come ON ! " 
Every time it stopped Mr . Weasley cursed furiously and pummeled the number nine button . 
" The Atrium , " said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open , showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain . 
" Of course . " 
" Department of Mysteries , " said the cool female voice , and left it at that . 
" Quick , Harry , " said Mr . Weasley as the lift doors rattled open , and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above . 
The walls were bare ; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor . 
Harry expected them to go through it , but instead Mr . Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left , where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps . 
They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor , which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to Snape's dungeon at Hogwarts , with rough stone walls and torches in brackets . 
Mr . Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall , clutching at a stitch in his chest . 
" No , no , I'm not allowed . 
He swallowed hard , turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom . 
Harry gasped ; he could not help himself . 
This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore's Pensieve , the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban . 
The walls were made of dark stone , dimly lit by torches . 
They had been talking in low voices , but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell . 
" Sorry , " said Harry nervously " I — I didn't know the time had been changed . " 
" That is not the Wizengamot's fault , " said the voice . 
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room , the arms of which were covered in chains . 
His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor . 
When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly , but did not bind him . 
Feeling rather sick , he looked up at the people seated at the bench above . 
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge , the Minister for Magic . 
Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime - green bowler hat , though today he had dispensed with it ; he had dispensed , too , with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry . 
A broad , square - jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudge's left ; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding . 
On Fudge's right was another witch , but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow . 
" Yes , sir , " said an eager voice Harry knew . 
Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench . 
Harry looked at Percy , expecting some sign of recognition from him , but none came . 
" Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August , " said Fudge in a ringing voice , and Percy began taking notes at once , " into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter , resident at number four , Privet Drive , Little Whinging , Surrey . 
" Interrogators : Cornelius Oswald Fudge , Minister for Magic ; Amelia Susan Bones , Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement ; Dolores Jane Umbridge , Senior Undersecretary to the Minister . 
" Witness for the defense , Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore , " said a quiet voice from behind Harry , who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck . 
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight - blue robes and a perfectly calm expression . 
His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half - moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose . 
The members of the Wizengamot were muttering . 
All eyes were now on Dumbledore . 
Some looked annoyed , others slightly frightened ; two elderly witches in the back row , however , raised their hands and waved in welcome . 
He wanted to catch Dumbledore's eye , but Dumbledore was not looking his way ; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge . 
" Dumbledore . 
Yes . 
You - er - got our – er - message that the time and - er - place of the hearing had been changed , then ? " " I must have missed it , " said Dumbledore cheerfully … " However , due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early , so no harm done . " 
Dumbledore sat down , put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest . 
Yes . " 
He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him , took a deep breath , and read out , " the charges against the accused are as follows : That he did knowingly , deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions , having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge , produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle - inhabited area , in the presence of a Muggle , on the second of August at twenty - three minutes past nine , which constitutes an offence under Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery , 1875 , and also under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy . 
" You are Harry James Potter , of number four , Privet Drive , Little Whinging , Surrey ? " Fudge said , glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment . 
" Yes , " Harry said . 
" Yes , but - " 
" And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August ? " said Fudge . 
" Yes , " said Harry , " but - " 
" Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen ? " 
" Yes , but - " 
" Yes , but - " 
" Yes , " said Harry , " because - " 
" A - what ? " said Harry . 
" Yes , " said Harry , feeling both impatient and slightly desperate , " it's a stag , it's always a stag . " 
" Yes , and - " 
" It's not a question of how impressive the magic was , " said Fudge in a testy voice , " in fact , the more impressive the worse it is , I would have thought , given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle ! " 
" What do you mean , boy ? " 
" I mean there were two Dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin ! " 
" Yes . 
Muggles can't see Dementors , can they , boy ? 
" There were two of them , coming from opposite ends of the alley , everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it - " 
He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two , then , with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together , said , " We haven't got time to listen to more tarradiddles , I'm afraid , Dumbledore . 
" I may be wrong , " said Dumbledore pleasantly , " but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights , the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case ? 
Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , Madam Bones ? " he continued , addressing the witch in the monocle . 
" I brought her with me , " said Dumbledore . " She's just outside the door . 
" No — Weasley , you go , " Fudge barked at Percy , who got up at once , ran down the stone steps from the judge's balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them . 
A moment later , Percy returned , followed by Mrs . Figg . 
She looked scared and more batty than ever . 
Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers . 
" Arabella Doreen Figg , " said Mrs . Figg in her quavery voice . 
" And who exactly are you ? " said Fudge , in a bored and lofty voice . 
" I'm a resident of Little Whinging , close to where Harry Potter lives , " said Mrs . Figg . 
" I'm a Squib , " said Mrs . Figg . 
Incidentally , can Squibs see Dementors ? " he added , looking left and right along the bench . 
Fudge looked back down at her , his eyebrows raised . 
" What is your story ? " 
" I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk , around about nine o ' clock , on the evening of the second of August , " gabbled Mrs . Figg at once , as though she had learned what she was saying by heart , " when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk . 
On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running - " 
" What did they look like ? " said Madam Bones , narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh . 
" Well , one was very large and the other one rather skinny - " 
" Oh , " said Mrs . Figg , the pink flush creeping up her neck now . 
Big and wearing cloaks . " 
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach . 
Whatever Mrs . Figg might say , it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor , and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like : the eerie way they moved , hovering inches over the ground ; or the rotting smell of them ; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air … 
In the second row , a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbor , a frizzy - haired witch . 
She smirked and nodded . 
" I see . 
Anything else ? " 
" Yes , " said Mrs . Figg . 
Everything went cold , and this was a very warm summer's night , mark you . 
And I felt … as though all happiness had gone from the world … and I remembered … dreadful things … " 
Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly . 
" What did the Dementors do ? " she asked , and Harry felt a rush of hope . 
" They went for the boys , " said Mrs . Figg , her voice stronger and more confident now , the pink flush ebbing away from her face . 
The other was backing away , trying to repel the Dementor . 
That was Harry . 
On the third attempt , he produced a Patronus , which charged down the first Dementor and then , with his encouragement , chased the second one away from his cousin . 
And that that is what happened , " Mrs . Figg finished , somewhat lamely . 
Madam Bones looked down at Mrs . Figg in silence . 
Fudge was not looking at her at all , but fidgeting with his papers . 
Finally , he raised his eyes and said , rather aggressively , " that's what you saw , is it ? " 
" That is what happened , " Mrs . Figg repeated . 
" Oh , I don't know , " said Madam Bones , in her booming voice . 
snorted Fudge . 
" Oh , I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence , " said Dumbledore lightly . 
" I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling through Little Whanging ! " barked Fudge . 
" Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" I have already given you my views on this matter , Cornelius . " 
" Yes , you have "'said Fudge forcefully , " and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge , Dumbledore . 
" Then , " said Dumbledore , quietly but clearly , " we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of Dementors into that alleyway on the second of August . " 
In the complete silence that greeted these words , the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards so that Harry saw her for the first time . 
He thought she looked just like a large , pale toad . 
She was rather squat with a broad , flabby face , as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide , slack mouth . 
Her eyes were large , round and slightly bulging . 
Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue . 
" I'm sure I must have misunderstood you , Professor Dumbledore , " she said , with a simper that left her big , round eyes as cold as ever . 
But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy ! " 
She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up . 
A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her . 
" If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic , and it is also true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago , then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks , " said Dumbledore politely . 
" I would remind everybody that the behavior of these Dementors , if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination , is not the subject of this hearing ! " said Fudge . 
" We are here to examine Harry Potter's offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery ! " 
" Of course we are , " said Dumbledore , " but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant . 
Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances , and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch him - or herself , or any witches , wizards or Muggles present at the time of the - " 
" Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes ? " 
" Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock - and - bull stories this boy has come out with , Dumbledore , while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school ? 
In a Muggle house ! 
" I - not - I haven't got time to listen to house - elves ! 
Anyway , that's not the only - he blew up his aunt , for God's sake ! " Fudge shouted , banging his fist on the judge's bench and upsetting a bottle of ink . 
" And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion , accepting , I presume , that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions , " said Dumbledore calmly , as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes . 
" But , as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school , Harry's behavior there is not relevant to this hearing , " said Dumbledore , as politely as ever , but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words . 
" The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students , Cornelius , as I reminded you on the night of the second of August , " said Dumbledore . " Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven ; again , as I reminded you on the night of the second of August . 
Why , in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot , it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic ! " 
A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats . 
" As far as I am aware , " Dumbledore continued , " there is no law yet in place that says this court's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed . 
He has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defense . 
All he and I can do now is to await your verdict . " 
Fudge glared at him , evidently incensed . 
Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore , seeking reassurance ; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot , in effect , that it was about time they made a decision . 
Again , however , Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry's attempt to catch his eye . 
He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent , whispered conversations . 
Harry looked at his feet . 
He had expected the hearing to last longer than this . 
He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression . 
He had not really said very much . 
He ought to have explained more fully about the Dementors , about how he had fallen over , about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed … 
Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak , but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes . 
Then the whispering stopped . 
Harry wanted to look up at the judges , but found that it was really much , much easier to keep examining his laces . 
There were hands in the air , many of them … more than half ! 
Fudge raised his hand ; so did half a dozen others , including the witch on his right and the heavily - moustached wizard and the frizzy - haired witch in the second row . 
Fudge glanced around at them all , looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat , then lowered his own hand . 
He took two deep breaths and said , in a voice distorted by suppressed rage , " Very well , very well … cleared of all charges . " 
" Excellent , " said Dumbledore briskly , springing to his feet , pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish . 
And without looking once at Harry , he swept from the dungeon . 
Harry stood up . 
Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention , except the toadlike witch on Fudge's right , who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore . 
Ignoring her , he tried to catch Fudge's eye , or Madam Bones's , wanting to ask whether he was free to go , but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry , and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase , so he took a few tentative steps towards the exit and , when nobody called him back , broke into a very fast walk . 
He took the last few steps at a run , wrenched open the door and almost collided with Mr . Weasley , who was standing right outside , looking pale and apprehensive . 
" Cleared , " Harry said , pulling the door closed behind him , " of all charges ! " 
Beaming , Mr . Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders . 
" Harry , that's wonderful ! 
" I think so , " said Harry quietly . 
Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon . 
Fudge acted as though Mr . Weasley and Harry were part of the wall , but again , the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed . 
Like Fudge , he completely ignored his father and Harry ; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills , his back rigid and his nose in the air . 
" I'm going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news , " he said , beckoning Harry forwards as Percy's heels disappeared up the steps to Level Nine . 
" I ' ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green . 
Come on … " 
Harry asked , grinning . 
It was starting to sink in : he was cleared , he was going back to Hogwarts . 
" Oh , it's a simple enough anti - jinx , " said Mr . Weasley as they mounted the stairs , " but it's not so much having to repair the damage , it's more the attitude behind the vandalism , Harry . 
They had just reached the ninth - level corridor and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from them , talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed , pale face . 
" Well , well , well … Patronus Potter , " said Lucius Malfoy coolly . 
Harry could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face ; he could not believe that he was here , in the Ministry of Magic , or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him , when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater . 
Mr . Weasley gripped Harry's shoulder in warning . 
" And Arthur Weasley too ! 
What are you doing here , Arthur ? " 
" Not here , surely ? " said Mr . Malfoy , raising his eye brows and glancing towards the door over Mr . Weasley's shoulder . 
" What are you doing here , anyway ? " 
Harry asked Lucius Malfoy . 
" I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours , Potter , " said Malfoy , smoothing the front of his robes . 
Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold . 
" Really , just because you are Dumbledore's favorite boy , you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us … shall we go up to your office , then , Minister ? " 
" Certainly " said Fudge , turning his back on Harry and Mr . Weasley . 
Mr . Weasley did not let go of Harry's shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift . 
Harry burst out furiously . 
I ' ll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off , he ought to know Malfoys been talking to Fudge again . " 
The lift arrived ; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr . Weasley's head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut . 
" Mr . 
" But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment - which , as Dumbledore says , is not a lot of comfort . 
Best not talk about it any more just now , Harry . " 
They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered . 
He looked up into the handsome wizard's face , but up close Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish . 
With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf , Harry turned his moneybag upside - down and emptied not just ten Galleons , but the whole contents into the pool . 
" That's enough ! 
" What ? " said Sirius sharply . 
Dumbledore ought to know . " 
Molly , I ' ll be late , I'm covering for Tonks , but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner - " 
" That's enough - Fred - George - Ginny ! " said Mrs . Weasley , as Mr . Weasley left the kitchen . 
The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden ; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise . 
He felt it would sound highly ungrateful , not to mention childish , to say , " I wish he'd talked to me , though . 
" Scar , " Harry mumbled . 
" But it's nothing … it happens all the time now … " 
" I don't think he ' ll be able to , Ron , " said Mrs . Weasley , setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry . 
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve , Grimmauld Place , who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts . 
Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news , wringing Harry's hand and beaming just like the rest of them . 
" It's Headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix , isn't it ? 
But I sometimes think Ron's mums right and Sirius gets confused about whether you ' re you or your father , Harry . " 
" I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break " said Ron bitterly . 
" You were so keen to help the Order , " said Mrs . Weasley , " you can do your bit by making Headquarters fit to live in . " 
" I feel like a house - elf , " grumbled Ron . 
Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached ; he could not wait to see Hagrid again , to play Quidditch , even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses ; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty , musty house , where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed , though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius . 
The fact was that living at the Headquarters of the anti - Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he'd experienced it . 
Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly , sometimes staying for meals , sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation , Mrs . Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot ( whether Extendable or normal ) and nobody , not even Sirius , seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival . 
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwigs owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes . 
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron's head into the wastepaper basket in the corner , which swallowed it and belched loudly . 
It contained two pieces of parchment : one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September ; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year . 
" Only two new ones , " he said , reading the list , " The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 5 , by Miranda Goshawk , and Defensive Magical Theory , by Wilbert Slinkhard . " 
Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry . 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" One sacked , one dead , one's memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months , " said Harry , counting them off on his fingers . 
Ron did not answer . 
Harry looked round . 
Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open , gaping at his letter from Hogwarts . 
" What's the matter ? " said Fred impatiently , moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment . 
" Prefect ? " he said , staring incredulously at the letter . 
" There's been a mistake , " said Fred , snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark . 
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a scathing look . 
Ron , who still had not said a word , took the badge , stared at it for a moment , then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine . 
Harry took it . 
Hermione came tearing into the room , her cheeks flushed and her hair flying . 
She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek . 
" Me too , Harry , me too ! " 
" No , " said Harry quickly , pushing the badge back into Ron's hand . 
" It's Ron , not me . " 
" Ron's prefect , not me , " Harry said . 
" But … are you sure ? 
" I … " said Hermione , looking thoroughly bewildered . 
" No , " said Hermione , blushing harder than ever , " no it's not … Ron's done loads of … he's really … " 
" Ginny said the booklists had come at last , " she said , glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles . 
" His badge , " said Fred , with the air of getting the worst over quickly . 
Fred's words took a moment to penetrate Mrs . Weasley's preoccupation with pajamas . 
" His … but … Ron , you ' re not … ? " 
Oh , Ron , how wonderful ! 
Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back but Mrs . Weasley did not notice ; arms tight around Ron's neck , she was kissing him all over his face , which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge . 
We gave Percy an owl , but you ' ve already got one , of course . " 
" W - what do you mean ? " said Ron , looking as though he did not dare believe his ears . 
" Or a new cauldron , Charlie's old one's rusting through , or a new rat , you always liked Scabbers " 
" Mum , " said Ron hopefully , " can I have a new broom ? " 
" Just - just a new one for a change … " 
Mrs . Weasley hesitated , then smiled . 
She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek , sniffed loudly , and bustled from the room . 
Fred and George exchanged looks . 
Fred and George burst out laughing , and Ron muttered , " Drop it , Hermione . " 
" Those two ! " said Hermione furiously , staring up at the ceiling , through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs . 
I wish I could go with Mum and choose … she ' ll never be able to afford a Nimbus , but there's the new Cleansweep out , that'd be great … yeah , I think I ' ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep , just so she knows . " 
He dashed from the room , leaving Harry and Hermione alone . 
He turned to his bed , picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs . Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk . 
" Harry ? " said Hermione tentatively . 
Great . " 
He leaned over his trunk , laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down . 
A few moments passed ; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double , listening ; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings . 
He straightened up and looked behind him . 
Harry hurried across the room , closed the door , then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it , gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe . 
He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people . 
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands . 
He could not lie to himself ; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way , he would have expected it to come to him , not Ron . 
Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy ? 
Was that true ? 
But what about outside lessons ? 
Well , Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time , said the voice in Harry's head . 
They weren't in that graveyard with me , the night Voldemort returned … 
Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge . 
This was not Ron's fault . 
Was he , Harry , Ron's best friend in the world , going to sulk because he didn't have a badge , laugh with the twins behind Ron's back , ruin this for Ron when , for the first time , he had beaten Harry at something ? 
At this point Harry heard Ron's footsteps on the stairs again . 
It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks . 
Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefects badge around , first placing it on his bedside table , then putting it into his jeans pocket , then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes , as though to see the effect of the red on the black . 
Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk . 
Mrs . Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o ' clock , laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing . 
" Never mind unwrapping it now , people are arriving for dinner , I want you all downstairs , " she said , but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom , an ecstatic expression on his face . 
" I thought we'd have a little party , not a sit - down dinner , " she told Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred , George and Ginny as they entered the room . 
Fred rolled his eyes . 
" We ' ve been wanting to ask you for ages - could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what's inside it ? 
" Desk in the corner ? 
Yeah , I see it … yeah , it's a Boggart … want me to go up and get rid of it , Molly ? " 
" Prefect , eh ? " growled Moody , his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head . 
Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother . 
Mrs . Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them ; he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody's traveling cloak . 
" To Ron and Hermione , the new Gryffindor prefects ! " 
Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them , and then applauded . 
Ginny laughed ; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it . 
Lupin was the good boy , he got the badge . " 
" I need scarcely say that I failed dismally . " 
" … nought to seventy in ten seconds , not bad , is it ? 
" Oh - I dunno - " said Harry , slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion ; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George , who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus . 
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry , but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer . 
" It's okay , " he told Mundungus , " we can trust Harry , he's our financial backer . " 
" Look what Dung's got us , " said George , holding out his hand to Harry . 
" I'm sorry , lads , but I'm not taking a Knut under twenty . " 
" Dung likes his little joke , " Fred said to Harry . 
It had just occurred to him that Mr . and Mrs . Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when , as was inevitable , they finally found out about it . 
Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time , but what if it led to another family row and a Percylike estrangement ? 
Would Mrs . Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable ? 
Standing where the twins had left him , with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company , Harry caught the sound of his own name . 
Harry did not look round ; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he had heard . 
Though not remotely hungry , he followed Mundungus back towards the table . 
Mad - Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken - leg with what remained of his nose ; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison , because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth . 
" … the handles made of Spanish oak with anti - jinx varnish and in - built vibration control - " Ron was saying to Tonks . 
Mrs . Weasley yawned widely . 
" Well , I think I ' ll sort out that Boggart before I turn in … Arthur , I don't want this lot up too late , all right ? 
Night , Harry , dear . " 
Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention . 
" Yeah , fine , " lied Harry . 
Moody took a swig from his hipflask , his electric - blue eye staring sideways at Harry . 
Harry took the photograph . 
A small crowd of people , some waving at him , others lifting their glasses , looked back up at him . 
The Moody in the picture was unmistakable , though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact . 
" And there's Dumbledore beside me , Dedalus Diggle on the other side … that's Marlene McKinnon , she was killed two weeks after this was taken , they got her whole family . 
" That's Edgar Bones … brother of Amelia Bones , they got him and his family , too , he was a great wizard … Sturgis Podmore , blimey , he looks young … Caradoc Dearborn , vanished six months after this , we never found his body … Hagrid , of course , looks exactly the same as ever … Elphias Doge , you ' ve met him , I'd forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat … Gideon Prewett , it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian , they fought like heroes … budge along , budge along … " 
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture . 
His mother and father were beaming up at him , sitting on either side of a small , watery - eyed man whom Harry recognized at once as Wormtail , the one who had betrayed his parents ' whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths . 
Harry looked up into Moody's heavily scarred and pitted face . 
Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat . 
Harry crossed the kitchen , slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back . 
And then , to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces … Benjy Fenwick , who had been found in bits , and Gideon Prewett , who had died like a hero , and the Longbottoms , who had been tortured into madness … all waving happily out of the photograph forever more , not knowing that they were doomed … well , Moody might find that interesting … he , Harry , found it disturbing … 
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf - heads , glad to be on his own again , but as he approached the first landing he heard noises . 
Someone was sobbing in the drawing room . 
Harry said . 
He climbed the remaining stairs two at a time , walked across the landing and opened the drawing - room door . 
Someone was cowering against the dark wall , her wand in her hand , her whole body shaking with sobs . 
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry's lungs ; he felt as though he were falling through the floor ; his brain turned icy cold - Ron dead , no , it couldn't be - 
Weasley ? " 
Harry croaked . 
Mrs . Weasley sobbed , pointing her shaking wand at Ron's body . 
Ron's body turned into Bill's , spread - eagled on his back , his eyes wide open and empty . 
" No ! " Mrs . Weasley moaned . 
" No … riddikulus ! 
Riddikulus ! 
Dead twins . 
Dead Harry … 
shouted Harry , staring down at his own dead body on the floor . 
" What's going on ? " 
Lupin looked from Mrs . Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant . 
Pulling out his own wand , he said , very firmly and clearly : 
" Riddikulus ! " 
Harry's body vanished . 
A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain . 
Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke . 
" Oh - oh - oh ! " gulped Mrs . Weasley , and she broke into a storm of crying , her face in her hands . 
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the Boggart , pretending to be Harry's body , had lain . 
He had a funny feeling Moody's magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen . 
" Half the f - f - family's in the Order , it ' ll b - b - be a miracle if we all come through this … and P - P - Percy's not talking to us … what if something d - d - dreadful happens and we ' ve never m - m - made it up with him ? 
And what's going to happen if Arthur and I get killed , who's g - g - going to look after Ron and Ginny ? " 
" Molly that's enough " said Lupin firmly . 
Mrs . Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name . 
" Oh , Molly , come on , it's about time you got used to hearing his name - look , I can't promise no one's going to get hurt , nobody can promise that , but we ' re much better off than we were last time . 
Last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one … " 
Harry thought of the photograph again , of his parents ' beaming faces . 
It's only a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open ; once he does , the whole Ministry's going to be begging us to forgive them . 
And I'm not sure I ' ll be accepting their apology , " he added bitterly . 
" And as for who's going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died , " said Lupin , smiling slightly , " what do you think we'd do , let them starve ? " 
But Harry , closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later , could not think Mrs . Weasley silly . 
He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph , unaware that their lives , like so many of those around them , were drawing to a close . 
The image of the Boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs . Weasley's family in turn kept flashing before his eyes . 
" First sign of madness , talking to your own head , " said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall . 
Harry ignored it . 
He felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefects badge . 
CHAPTER TEN : Luna Lovegood 
Harry had a troubled nights sleep . 
His parents wove in and out of his dreams , never speaking ; Mrs . Weasley sobbed over Kreachers dead body , watched by Ron and Hermione who were wearing crowns , and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door . 
There was a lot of commotion in the house . 
From what he heard as he dressed at top speed , Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them , with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall ; Mrs . Black and Mrs . Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices . 
Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder , and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms . 
The owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage . 
" Guard ? " said Harry . 
" Why ? " said Harry irritably . 
Mrs . Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room . 
Mrs . Black's portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her ; all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again , anyway . 
She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak September sunlight . 
Harry and the dog followed her . 
Harry said , looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve , which vanished the moment they reached the pavement . 
" She's waiting for us just up here , " said Mrs . Weasley stiffly , averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry . 
An old woman greeted them on the corner . 
Harry couldn't help laughing . 
Mrs . Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia - ish way . 
It took them twenty minutes to reach King's Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry's entertainment . 
Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear , then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and three - quarters , where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families . 
" I hope the others make it in time , " said Mrs . Weasley anxiously , staring behind her at the wrought - iron arch spanning the platform , through which new arrivals would come . 
Seconds later , Mr . Weasley emerged on to the platform with Ron and Hermione . 
" I ' ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore , " said Moody , " that's the second time he's not turned up in a week . 
He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder . 
" You too Harry . 
" And don't forget , all of you - careful what you put in writing . 
A warning whistle sounded ; the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train . 
For one brief moment , the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on Harry's shoulders , but Mrs . Weasley shoved Harry away towards the train door , hissing , " For heaven's sake , act more like a dog , Sirius ! " 
" See you ! " Harry called out of the open window as the train began to move , while Ron , Hermione and Ginny waved beside him . 
The figures of Tonks , Lupin , Moody and Mr . and Mrs . Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window , wagging its tail ; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train , then they rounded a bend , and Sirius was gone . 
See you later , " and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right . 
Harry asked . 
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks . 
" Er , " said Ron . 
" We're - well - Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage , " Hermione said awkwardly . 
" Oh , " said Harry . 
" Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time . " 
" Fine , " said Harry again . 
" It's a pain having to go down there , I'd rather - but we have to - I mean , I'm not enjoying it , I'm not Percy , " he finished defiantly . 
" I know you ' re not , " said Harry and he grinned . 
But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks , Crookshanks and a caged Pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train , Harry felt an odd sense of loss . 
He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron . 
" Right , " said Harry , picking up Hedwig's cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other . 
They struggled off down the corridor , peering through the glass - paneled doors into the compartments they passed , which were already full . 
Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbors and pointed him out . 
After he had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show - off he was . 
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom , Harry's fellow fifth - year Gryffindor , his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one - handed grip on his struggling toad , Trevor . 
" Hi , Harry " he panted . 
She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside . 
Harry and Neville followed . 
The girl beside the window looked up . 
She had straggly , waist - length , dirty blonde hair , very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look . 
Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping , or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks , or that she was reading a magazine upside - down . 
Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry . 
" Thanks , " said Ginny , smiling at her . 
Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig's cage in the luggage rack and sat down . 
Luna watched them over her upside - down magazine , which was called The Quibbler . 
She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans . 
She stared and stared at Harry , who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadn't . 
You ' re Harry Potter , " she added . 
" I know I am , " said Harry . 
Neville chuckled . 
" I'm nobody , " said Neville hurriedly . 
" No you ' re not , " said Ginny sharply . 
" Neville Longbottom - Luna Lovegood . 
" Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure , " said Luna in a singsong voice . 
She raised her upside - down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent . 
Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised . 
He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot , except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines . 
Harry stared at the thing . 
I can't wait to show it to Professor Sprout . 
My Great Uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria . 
I'm going to see if I can breed from it . " 
Harry knew that Neville's favorite subject was Herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant . 
He dumped the toad into Harry's lap and took a quill from his schoolbag . 
Luna Lovegood's popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside - down magazine again , to watch what Neville was doing . 
Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up t o his eyes , his tongue between his teeth , chose his spot , and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill . 
They hit the ceiling , the windows , and spattered Luna Lovegood's magazine ; Ginny , who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time , merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat , but Harry , whose hands had been busy preventing Trevor's escape , received a faceful . 
Neville , whose face and torso were also drenched , shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes . 
A very pretty girl with long , shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him : Cho Chang , the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team . 
Rather pink in the face , she closed the door and departed . 
Harry , Ginny and Neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog Cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in , accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage . 
" I'm starving , " said Ron , stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig , grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him . 
He ripped open the wrapper , bit off the frog's head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning . 
" Course , " said Ron bitterly , stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another . 
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood , who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler . 
I don't think I'd have minded , " she added thoughtfully , " I don't like dancing very much . " 
Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds , then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation , but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling . 
" We're supposed to patrol the corridors every so often , " he told Harry and Neville , " and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving . 
" You ' re not supposed to abuse your position , Ron ! " said Hermione sharply . 
" I ' ll make Goyle do lines , it ' ll kill him , he hates writing , " said Ron happily . 
He lowered his voice to Goyle's low grunt and , screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration , mimed writing in midair . 
" I … must … not … look … like … a … baboon's … backside . " 
She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack , hissing . 
Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp , slid down her legs and on to the floor . 
Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath , staring at Ron . Utterly nonplussed , he looked around at the others , who were now laughing at the expression on Ron's face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood , who was rocking backwards and forwards , clutching her sides . 
" Are you taking the mickey ? " said Ron , frowning at her . 
Everyone else was watching Luna laughing , but Harry glancing at the magazine on the floor , noticed something that made him dive for it . 
Upside - down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was , but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius Fudge ; Harry only recognized him because of the lime - green bowler hat . 
One of Fudge's hands was clenched around a bag of gold ; the other hand was throttling a goblin . 
Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine . 
She nodded , still gazing at Ron , breathless with laughter . 
Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index . 
Until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr . Weasley to give to Sirius , but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler . 
He found the page , and turned excitedly to the article . 
This , too , was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon ; in fact , Harry would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn't been captioned . 
Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out . 
Harry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it . 
Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation ? 
Black's audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic . 
None of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the Dementors . 
Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azkaban .
Harry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were having the same hallucination , if that was what it was , so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him . 
Nevertheless , he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window . 
" What's she doing back here ? 
" I ' ll be quite glad if he has , " said Luna , " he isn't a very good teacher , is he ? " 
" Yes , he is ! " said Harry , Ron and Ginny angrily . 
Harry glared at Hermione . 
She cleared her throat and quickly said , " Erm … yes … he's very good . " 
" Well , we in Ravenclaw think he's a bit of a joke , " said Luna , unfazed . 
Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron's rudeness ; on the contrary , she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television program . 
Rattling and swaying , the carriages moved in convoy up the road . 
When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds , Harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid's cabin by the Forbidden Forest , but the grounds were in complete darkness . 
The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first . 
He turned again to look for lit windows down by the Forest , but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrids cabin . 
Unwillingly , because he had half - hoped they would have vanished , he turned his eyes instead upon the strange , skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air , their blank white eyes gleaming . 
Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that Ron could not , but that had been a reflection in a mirror , something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages . 
If Luna was to be believed , the beasts had always been there but invisible . 
Why , then , could Harry suddenly see them , and why could Ron not ? 
" Are you coming or what " said Ron beside him . 
" Oh … yeah , " said Harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle . 
The Entrance Hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right , leading to the Great Hall and the start - ofterm feast . 
The four long house tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling , which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows . 
Candles floated in midair all along the tables , illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly , exchanging summer news , shouting greetings at friends from other houses , eyeing one another's new haircuts and robes . 
Again , Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed ; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared . 
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table . 
The moment they reached Gryffindors , Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth - years and left to sit with them ; Harry , Ron , Hermione and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick , the Gryffindor house ghost , and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown , the last two of whom gave Harry airy , overly - friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before . 
He had more important things to worry about , however : he was looking over the students ' heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall . 
" Of course he hasn't , " said Harry firmly . 
" No , " said Harry at once . 
" But where is he , then ? " 
There was a pause , then Harry said very quietly , so that Neville , Parvati and Lavender could not hear , " Maybe he's not back yet . 
You know - from his mission - the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore . ' 
" Yeah … yeah , that ' ll be it , " said Ron , sounding reassured , but Hermione bit her lip , looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid's absence . 
" Who's that ? " she said sharply , pointing towards the middle of the staff table . 
Harry's eyes followed hers . 
They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore , sitting in his high - backed golden chair at the center of the long staff table , wearing deep - purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat . 
Dumbledore's head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him , who was talking into his ear . 
She looked , Harry thought , like somebody's maiden aunt : squat , with short , curly , mouse - brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes . 
Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw , with a shock of recognition , a pallid , toadlike face and a pair of prominent , pouchy eyes . 
" Who ? " said Hermione . 
Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask ; his attention had been caught by Professor Grubbly - Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table ; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrids . 
That meant the first - years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle , and sure enough , a few seconds later , the doors from the Entrance Hall opened . 
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away . 
The first - years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students , and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them , then stood back . 
A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling . 
Harry recalled , fleetingly , how terrified he had felt when he had stood there , waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged . 
Then the rip near the hat's brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song : 
Unless it was the second pair 
Said Hufflepuff , " I ' ll teach the lot , And treat them just the same . " 
For each of the four founders had 
While the bravest and the boldest 
Now turned upon each other and , 
What with dueling and with fighting 
And now the Sorting Hat is here 
Though condemned I am to split you 
Still I worry that it's wrong , 
Oh , know the perils , read the signs , 
I have told you , I have warned you … 
All across the Great Hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbors , and Harry , clapping along with everyone else , knew exactly what they were talking about . 
The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts houses and its own role in Sorting them . 
Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before . 
" The Hat feels itself honor - bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels – " 
But Professor McGonagall , who was waiting to read out the list of first - years ' names , was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches . 
Nearly Headless Nick placed a seethrough finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end . 
With a last frowning look that swept the four house tables , Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first name . 
The terrified - looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the Hat on his head ; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears . 
The Hat considered for a moment , then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted : 
Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor house as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down , looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again . 
In the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat's decisions , Harry could hear Ron's stomach rumbling loudly . 
Finally , " Zeller , Rose " was Sorted into Hufflepuff , and Professor McGonagall picked up the Hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet . 
Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses , he had felt that his return to Hogwarts , so long anticipated , was full of unexpected surprises , like jarring notes in a familiar song . 
" To our newcomers , " said Dumbledore in a ringing voice , his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips , " welcome ! 
There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate - for food had appeared out of nowhere , so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables , bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice . 
" Excellent , " said Ron , with a kind of groan of longing , and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate , watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick . 
" What were you saying before the Sorting ? " Hermione asked the ghost . 
" Yes , I have heard the Hat give several warnings before , always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school . 
And always , of course , its advice is the same : stand together , be strong from within . " 
Ron gave an enormous swallow and said , " How can it know if the school's in danger if it's a Hat ? " 
" And it wants all the houses to be friends ? " said Harry , looking over at the Slytherin table , where Draco Malfoy was holding court . 
We ghosts , though we belong to separate houses , maintain links of friendship . 
In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin , I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron . " 
I hope I , Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington , have never been guilty of cowardice in my life ! 
" What blood ? " asked Ron . 
" I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like , even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me ! 
But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death , I assure you ! " 
" Nick , he wasn't really laughing at you ! " said Hermione , throwing a furious look at Ron . 
Unfortunately , Ron's mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was " Node iddum eentup sechew , " which Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology . 
Rising into the air , he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table , coming to rest between the Creevey brothers , Colin and Dennis . 
" Oh , forget it , " said Hermione irritably , and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence . 
Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them ; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie , then a large plateful of his favorite treacle tart . 
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the Hall was starting to creep upwards again , Dumbledore got to his feet once more . 
Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now . 
" Well , now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast , I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start - of - term notices , " said Dumbledore . " First - years ought to know that the Forest in the grounds is out - of - bounds to students - and a few of our older students ought to know by now , too . " 
( Harry , Ron and Hermione exchanged smirks . ) 
Filch , the caretaker , has asked me , for what he tells me is the four - hundred - and - sixty second time , to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes , nor are a number of other things , all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr . Filch's office door . 
We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly - Plank , who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons ; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge , our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . " 
Dumbledore continued , " Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the - " 
He broke off , looking enquiringly at Professor Umbridge . 
As she was not much taller standing than sitting , there was a moment when nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking , but then Professor Umbridge cleared her throat , " Hem , hem , " and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech . 
Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment , then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk . 
No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before . 
Her voice was high - pitched , breathy and little - girlish and , again , Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself ; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her , from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan . 
( " hem , hem " ) and continued . 
She smiled , revealing very pointed teeth . 
Harry glanced around . 
None of the faces he could see looked happy . 
On the contrary , they all looked rather taken - aback at being addressed as though they were five years old . 
" I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and I'm sure we ' ll be very good friends ! " 
" I ' ll be her friend as long as I don't have to borrow that cardigan , " Parvati whispered to Lavender , and both of them lapsed into silent giggles . 
Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again ( " hem , hem " ) , but when she continued , some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice . 
" The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance . 
The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever . 
Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members , none of whom bowed back to her . 
Professor McGonagall's dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike , and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little " hem , hem " and went on with her speech . 
" Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school , and that is as it should be , for without progress there will be stagnation and decay . 
A balance , then , between old and new , between permanence and change , between tradition and innovation … " 
Harry found his attentiveness ebbing , as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune . 
The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together , whispering and giggling . 
Over on the Ravenclaw table Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends . 
Meanwhile , at the Hufflepuff table Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor Umbridge , but he was glassy - eyed and Harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect's badge gleaming on his chest . 
Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience . 
Harry had the impression that a full - scale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech . 
The teachers , however , were still listening very attentively , and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke , though , judging by her expression , they were not at all to her taste . 
" … because some changes will be for the better , while others will come , in the fullness of time , to be recognized as errors of judgment . 
Meanwhile , some old habits will be retained , and rightly so , whereas others , outmoded and outworn , must be abandoned . 
Let us move forward , then , into a new era of openness , effectiveness and accountability , intent on preserving what ought to be preserved , perfecting what needs to be perfected , and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited . " 
She sat down . 
Dumbledore clapped . 
The staff followed his lead , though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping . 
A few students joined in , but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech , not having listened to more than a few words of it , and before they could start applauding properly , Dumbledore had stood up again . 
" Thank you very much , Professor Umbridge , that was most illuminating , " he said , bowing to her . " Now , as I was saying , Quidditch tryouts will be held … " 
" I said illuminating , not enjoyable , " said Hermione . 
" It explained a lot . ' 
" Did it " said Harry in surprise . 
" Ron , we ' re supposed to show the first - years where to go ! " 
" Ron ! " 
" Well , they are , they ' re titchy … " 
A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables , all of them trying hard not to lead the group . 
They did indeed seem very small ; Harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here . 
He grinned at them . 
A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified ; he nudged Euan and whispered something in his ear . 
" See you later , " he said dully to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone , doing everything he could to ignore more whispering , staring and pointing as he passed . 
He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall , then he hurried up the marble staircase , took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind . 
He had been stupid not to expect this , he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors . 
Of course everyone was staring at him ; he had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power . 
There had not been time last term to explain himself before they'd all had to go home - even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard . 
Harry had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he realized that he did not know the new password . 
" Er … " he said glumly , staring up at the Fat Lady , who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him . 
" Harry , I know it ! " 
" Guess what it is ? 
I'm actually going to be able to remember it for once - " He waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train . 
" Correct , " said the Fat Lady , and her portrait swung open towards them like a door , revealing a circular hole in the wall behind , through which Harry and Neville now climbed . 
The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever , a cozy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables . 
A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories ; on the other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard . 
Harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys'dormitories ; he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment . 
Neville followed him . 
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs . 
They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him . 
" Good holiday ? " 
" Not bad , " muttered Harry , as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it . 
" You ? " 
" Why , what happened , Seamus ? " Neville asked as he placed his Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet . 
Seamus did not answer immediately ; he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight . 
Then he said , with his back still turned to Harry , " Me mam didn't want me to come back . " 
" She didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts . " 
Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas out of his trunk , still not looking at Harry . 
" But - why ? " said Harry , astonished . 
He knew that Seamus's mother was a witch and could not understand , therefore , why she should have come over so Dursleyish . 
" What d ' you mean ? " said Harry quickly . 
His heart was beating rather fast . 
" Well , " said Seamus again , still avoiding Harry's eye , " she … er … well , it's not just you , it's Dumbledore , too … " 
Seamus looked up at him . 
" Yeah , something like that . " 
Harry said nothing . 
He threw his wand down on to his bedside table , pulled off his robes , stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pajamas . 
He was sick of it ; sick of being the person who was stared at and talked about all the time . 
If any of them knew , if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to … Mrs . Finnigan had no idea , the stupid woman , he thought savagely . 
He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him , but before he could do so , Seamus said , " Look … what did happen that night when … you know , when … with Cedric Diggory and all ? " 
Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time . 
" What are you asking me for ? " 
Harry retorted . 
That ' ll tell you all you need to know . " 
" What's going on ? " 
Ron had appeared in the doorway . 
His wide eyes traveled from Harry , who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus , to Seamus , who was standing there with his fists raised . 
" That's before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me ! " said Harry at the top of his voice . 
" He's right , I don't want to share a dormitory with him any more , he's a madman . " 
" Yeah , I do ! " said Ron angrily . 
" Then you ' re mad , too , " said Seamus in disgust . 
Well , unfortunately for you , pal , I'm also a prefect ! " said Ron , jabbing himself in the chest with a finger . 
Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind ; but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel , vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor . 
Ron glared at Seamus , then looked at Dean and Neville . 
Seamus snapped at him . 
They don't know our Headmaster's been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he's losing his marbles - " 
" She says it's the Daily Prophet that's going downhill , not Dumbledore . 
We believe Harry " said Neville simply . 
He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin , looking owlishly over them at Seamus . 
She says if Dumbledore says he's back , he's back . " 
Harry felt a rush of gratitude towards Neville . 
Nobody else said anything . 
Seamus got out his wand , repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them . 
Dean got into bed , rolled over and fell silent . 
Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed , putting his things away . 
Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer , as first the Wizengamot , then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks ? 
Was it anger at Harry , perhaps , that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months ? 
The two of them were in this together , after all ; Dumbledore had believed Harry , announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community . 
Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was , too , or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked … 
They ' ll know we ' re right in the end , thought Harry miserably , as Ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory . 
But he wondered how many more attacks like Seamus's he would have to endure before that time came . 
asked Harry loudly , as the hem of Seamus's robes whipped out of sight . 
" Don't worry about it , Harry , " Dean muttered , hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder , " he's just … " 
Neville and Ron both gave Harry an it's - his - problem - not - yours look , but Harry was not much consoled . 
" What's the matter ? " 
asked Hermione five minutes later , catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast . 
Like to earn a little extra gold ? 
Contact Fred and George Weasley , Gryffindor common room , for simple , part - time , virtually painless jobs . 
" They are the limit , " said Hermione grimly , taking d own the sign , which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend in October . 
" We ' ll have to talk to them , Ron . " 
Ron looked positively alarmed . 
Ron said nothing ; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting . 
" Seamus reckons Harry's lying about You - Know - Who , " said Ron succinctly , when Harry did not respond . 
" Been having a nice little chat with her about whet her or not I'm a lying , attention - seeking prat , have you ? " 
Harry said loudly . 
" No , " said Hermione calmly . 
" I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you , actually . 
" Sorry , " said Harry in a low voice . 
Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly and Hermione sighed again . 
" About You - Know - Who . 
" I listen , Ron , " said Hermione , with a touch of asperity . 
" So do I , but I still couldn't tell you exactly what - " 
You - Know - Who's only been back two months and we ' ve already started fighting among ourselves . 
And the Sorting Hats warning was the same : stand together , be united — " 
" If that means we ' re supposed to get matey with the Slytherins - fat chance . " 
" Well , I think it's a pity we ' re not trying for a bit of inter - house unity , " said Hermione crossly . 
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase . 
" Yeah , we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that , " said Harry sarcastically . 
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall , all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered . 
Professor Grubbly - Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra , the Astronomy teacher , and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence . 
" What ? " said both Harry and Ron together . 
" Well … maybe he didn't want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here . " 
Tryouts are on Friday at five o ' clock and I want the whole team there , all right ? 
Then we can see how the new personnel fit in . " 
" Okay , " said Harry . 
" I'd forgotten Wood had left , " said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her . 
" I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team ? " 
" I s ' pose , " said Harry , taking the bench opposite . 
" He was a good Keeper … " 
said Ron . 
With a whoosh and a clatter , hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows . 
They descended all over the Hall , bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water ; it was clearly raining hard outside . 
Hedwig was nowhere to be seen , but Harry was hardly surprised ; his only correspondent was Sirius , and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty - four hours apart . 
" What are you still getting that for ? " said Harry irritably , thinking of Seamus as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl's leg and it took off again . 
" I'm not bothering … load of rubbish . " 
" It's best to know what the enemy is saying , " said Hermione darkly , and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it , not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating . 
" Nothing , " she said simply , rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate . 
I wish Fred and George'd hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted … " 
" Cheers , " said Ron moodily , pocketing his timetable , " but I think I ' ll take the lessons . " 
" And Ron . " 
Hermione glared at him . 
Fred and George sniggered . 
asked Hermione . 
" So ? " 
" Anyway , it's a nightmare of a year , the fifth , " said George . 
" We're going to use it to do a bit of market research , find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from a joke shop , carefully evaluate the results of our research , then produce products to fit the demand . " 
" You ' re going to need all the ingredients and materials - and premises too , I suppose … " 
Harry did not look at the twins . 
His face felt hot ; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it . 
Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away , each carrying a stack of toast . 
" What did that mean ? " said Hermione , looking from Harry to Ron . " ' Ask us no questions … ' Does that mean they ' ve already got some gold to start a joke shop ? " 
Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters . 
Because of the exams ? " 
So you can choose what NEWTs you want to do next year . " 
" D ' you know what you want to do after Hogwarts ? " 
Harry asked the other two , as they left the Great Hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their History of Magic classroom . 
He looked slightly sheepish . 
" What ? " Harry urged him . 
What about you , Hermione ? " 
" I don't know , " she said . 
" I think I'd like to do something really worthwhile . " 
" An Auror's worthwhile ! " said Harry . 
" Yes , it is , but it's not the only worthwhile thing , " said Hermione thoughtfully , " I mean , if I could take SPEW further … " 
Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other . 
History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind . 
Professor Binns , their ghost teacher , had a wheezy , droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes , five in warm weather . 
Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione's notes before exams ; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns's voice . 
Today , they suffered an hour and a half's droning on the subject of giant wars . 
Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting , but then his brain disengaged , and he spent the remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron , while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye . 
" How would it be , " she asked them coldly , as they left the classroom for break ( Binns drifting away through the blackboard ) , " if I refused to lend you my notes this year ? " 
A fine misty drizzle was falling , so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony , turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year . 
They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult , just to catch them off guard after a two - month holiday , when someone walked around the corner towards them . 
" Hello , Harry ! " 
It was Cho Chang and , what was more , she was on her own again . 
This was most unusual : Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls ; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball . 
At least you ' re not covered in Stinksap this time , he told himself . 
The moment he had said this he wished he hadn't - Cedric had been Cho's boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harrys . 
Something seemed to tauten in her face , but she said , " Oh , it was all right , you know … " 
Ron demanded suddenly , pointing to the front of Cho's robes , where a sky - blue badge emblazoned with a double gold ' T ' was pinned . 
" Yeah , I do , " said Cho . 
" Anyway … see you , Harry . " 
She walked away . 
" What ? 
" Couldn't you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own ? " 
" So ? 
" But what does it matter ! " 
" It means they ' re not real fans , they ' re just jumping on the bandwagon - " 
" That's the bell , " said Harry dully , because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it . 
They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snape's dungeon , which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country . 
And yet , he thought , as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape's classroom door , she had chosen to come and talk to him , hadn't she ? 
She had been Cedric's girlfriend ; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died , yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way , not as though she thought him mad , or a liar , or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric's death … yes , she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him , and that made the second time in two days … and at this thought , Harry's spirits rose . 
Even the ominous sound of Snape's dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small , hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest . 
He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back , where he sat down between Ron and Hermione and ignored the huffy , irritable noises now issuing from both of them . 
" Settle down , " said Snape coldly , shutting the door behind him . 
There was no real need for the call to order ; the moment the class had heard the door close , quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped . 
" Before we begin today's lesson , " said Snape , sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all , " I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination , during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions . 
His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled . 
" But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell , " said Snape softly , " so , whether or not you are intending to attempt NEWT , I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level I have come to expect from my OWL students . 
" Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level : the Draught of Peace , a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation . 
Be warned : if you are too heavy - handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep , so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing . " 
" The ingredients and method - " Snape flicked his wand " - are on the blackboard - " ( they appeared there ) " - you will find everything you need — " he flicked his wand again " - in the store cupboard — " ( the door of the said cupboard sprang open ) " - you have an hour and a half … start . " 
Just as Harry , Ron and Hermione had predicted , Snape could hardly have set them a more difficult , fiddly potion . 
The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities ; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times , firstly in clockwise , then in anti - clockwise directions ; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added . 
Harry , who was sweating profusely , looked desperately around the dungeon . 
Seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand , as they seemed to be going out . 
The surface of Hermione's potion , however , was a shimmering mist of silver vapour , and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment , which meant he could find nothing to criticize . 
" Potter , what is this supposed to be ? " 
The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly ; they loved hearing Snape taunt Harry . 
Draco Malfoy laughed . 
" Yes , I can , " said Harry , his fingers clenched tightly around his wand . 
" Read the third line of the instructions for me , Potter . " 
Harry squinted at the blackboard ; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multi - colored steam now filling the dungeon . 
His heart sank . 
He had not added syrup of hellebore , but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes . 
" Did you do everything on the third line , Potter ? " 
" No , " said Harry very quietly . 
" I beg your pardon ? " 
" No , " said Harry , more loudly . 
" I forgot the hellebore . " 
" Homework : twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion making , to be handed in on Thursday . " 
His potion had been no worse than Ron's , which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs ; or Neville's , which had achieved the consistency of just - mixed cement and which Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron ; yet it was he , Harry , who would be receiving zero marks for the day's work . 
He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat , watching everyone else march up to Snape's desk with filled and corked flagons . 
When at long last the bell rang , Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall . 
The ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning . 
" That was really unfair , " said Hermione consolingly , sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd's pie . 
Neither of the others answered ; all three of them knew that Snape and Harry's mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts . 
" I did think he might be a bit better this year , " said Hermione in a disappointed voice . 
" I mean … you know … " she looked around carefully ; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table " … now he's in the Order and everything . " 
" Oh , shut up , the pair of you , " said Harry heavily , as Ron opened his mouth to argue back . 
Hermione and Ron both froze , looking angry and offended . 
" Can't you give it a rest ? " said Harry . 
" You ' re always having a go at each other , it's driving me mad . " 
And abandoning his shepherd's pie , he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there . 
He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time , past the many students hurrying towards lunch . 
Serve them right , he thought , why can't they give it a rest … bickering all the time … it's enough to drive anyone upthe wall … 
He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing ; Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry , who ignored him . 
" Come back , you scurvy dog ! Stand fast and fight ! " yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor , but Harry merely walked on and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighboring picture , he was rebuffed by its inhabitant , a large and angry - looking wolfhound . 
Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower . 
Consequently , he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney's classroom when the bell rang . 
After Potions , Divination was Harrys least favorite class , which was due mainly to Professor Trelawney's habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons . 
A thin woman , heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads , she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect , with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes . 
She was busy putting copies of battered leather - bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room , but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low - burning , sickly - scented fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows . 
The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes . 
" Good , " grunted Harry . 
" I'm not - " 
" But I reckon she's right . 
It's not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you . " 
" I never said it - " 
I have , of course , been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays , and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely - as , of course , I knew you would . 
Not , of course , that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination . 
If you have the Seeing Eye , certificates and grades matter very little . 
However , the Headmaster likes you to sit the examination , so … " 
" Turn , please , to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation . 
Then , divide into pairs . 
Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each others most recent dreams . 
Carry on . " 
The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period . 
By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book , they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation . 
At the table next to Harry and Ron , Dean had paired up with Neville , who immediately embarked on a long - winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother's best hat ; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly . 
He was not going to share his dreams with anyone . 
He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant , he did not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him . 
It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework . 
When the bell went , he and Ron led the way back down the ladder , Ron grumbling loudly . 
Binns set us a foot - and - a - half - long essay on giant wars , Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones , and now we ' ve got a month's dream diary from Trelawney ! 
Fred and George weren't wrong about OWL year , were they ? 
When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher's desk , wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head . 
The class was quiet as it entered the room ; Professor Umbridge was , as yet , an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be . 
" Tut , tut , " said Professor Umbridge . 
I should like you , please , to reply ' Good afternoon , Professor Umbridge ' . 
" There , now , " said Professor Umbridge sweetly . 
" That wasn't too difficult , was it ? 
Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill , ink and parchment . 
stated Professor Umbridge , turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her . 
" The constant changing of teachers , many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry approved curriculum , has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your OWL year . 
" You will be pleased to know , however , that these problems are now to be rectified . 
She rapped the blackboard again ; the first message vanished and was replaced by : Course Aims : 
2 . Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can legally be used . 
3 . Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use . 
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment . 
" I think we ' ll try that again , " said Professor Umbridge . 
" When I ask you a question , I should like you to reply , ' Yes , Professor Umbridge ' , or ' No , Professor Umbridge ' . 
" Yes , Professor Umbridge , " rang through the room . 
" Good , " said Professor Umbridge . 
There will be no need to talk . " 
Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher's desk , observing them all closely with those pouchy toad's eyes . 
Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read . 
It was desperately dull , quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns . 
Several silent minutes passed . 
Next to him , Ron was absent - mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers , staring at the same spot on the page . 
Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor . 
Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory . 
She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air . 
Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to , or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose . 
He looked at her enquiringly , but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions , and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge , who was looking just as resolutely in another direction . 
The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye rather than struggle on with ' Basics for Beginners ' . 
When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books , Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer . 
" Not about the chapter , no , " said Hermione . 
" Hermione Granger , " said Hermione . 
" Well , Miss Granger , I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully " said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness . 
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard . 
" We're not going to use magic ? " 
Professor Umbridge , smiling still more widely , turned her back on him . 
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too . 
Professor Umbridge's pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione . 
" Yes , Miss Granger ? 
" Yes , " said Hermione . 
" Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells ? " 
" Are you a Ministry - trained educational expert , Miss Granger ? " asked Professor Umbridge , in her falsely sweet voice . 
" No , but - " 
" Well then , I'm afraid you are not qualified to decide what the ' whole point ' of any class is . 
" What use is that ? " said Harry loudly . 
sang Professor Umbridge . 
Harry thrust his fist in the air . 
" And your name is ? " Professor Umbridge said to Dean . 
" No , but - " 
Professor Umbridge talked over him . 
As I was saying - you have been introduced to spells that have been complex , inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal . 
Hermione put up her hand . 
Professor Umbridge turned away from her . 
trilled Professor Umbridge . 
" Now , it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination , which , after all , is what school is all about . 
" Parvati Patil , and isn't there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL ? Aren't we supposed to show that we can actually do the counter - curses and things ? " 
" Are you telling us that the first time we ' ll get to do the spells will be during our exam ? " 
" And what good's theory going to be in the real world ? " said Harry loudly , his fist in the air again . 
Professor Umbridge looked up . 
" So we ' re not supposed to be prepared for what's waiting for us out there ? " 
" There is nothing waiting out there , Mr . Potter . " 
" Oh , yeah ? " said Harry . 
" Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves ? " enquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice . 
Professor Umbridge , however , did not flinch . 
The classroom was silent and still . 
Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry . 
" He wasn't dead , " said Harry angrily , " but yeah , he's returned ! " 
" I saw him , I fought him ! " 
" Detention , Mr . Potter ! " said Professor Umbridge triumphantly . 
" Tomorrow evening . 
I repeat , this is a lie . 
The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard . 
If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards , I would like to hear about it . 
I am here to help . 
I am your friend . 
And now , you will kindly continue your reading . 
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk . 
Harry , however , stood up . 
Everyone was staring at him ; Seamus looked half - scared , half - fascinated . 
" Harry , no ! " Hermione whispered in a warning voice , tugging at his sleeve , but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach . 
Harry asked , his voice shaking . 
There was a collective intake of breath from the class , for none of them , apart from Ron and Hermione , had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night Cedric had died . 
They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge , who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face . 
" Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident , " she said coldly . 
" It was murder , " said Harry . 
He could feel himself shaking . 
He had hardly spoken to anyone about this , least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates . 
For a moment , Harry thought she was going to scream at him . 
Then she said , in her softest , most sweetly girlish voice , " Come here , Mr . Potter , dear . " 
He kicked his chair aside , strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher's desk . 
He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath . 
He felt so angry he did not care what happened next . 
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag , stretched it out on the desk , dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling , hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing . 
After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand ; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it . 
" Take this to Professor McGonagall , dear , " said Professor Umbridge , holding out the note to him . 
He took it from her without saying a word , turned on his heel and left the room , not even looking back at Ron and Hermione , slamming the classroom door shut behind him . 
He walked very fast along the corridor , the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand , and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the poltergeist , a wide - mouthed little man floating on his back in midair , juggling several inkwells . 
" Why it's Potty Wee Potter ! " cackled Peeves , allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink ; Harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl . 
" Get out of it , Peeves . " 
Harry shouted , running down the nearest flight of stairs , but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him . 
" Oh , most think he's barking , the potty wee lad , But some are more kindly and think he's just sad , but Peevesy knows better and says that he's mad — " 
Professor McGonagall took it from him , frowning , slit it open with a tap of her wand , stretched it out and began to read . 
" Come in here , Potter . " 
He followed her inside her study . 
The door closed automatically behind him . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Yes . " 
" Yes . " 
Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk , watching Harry closely . 
Then she said , " Have a biscuit , Potter . " 
" Have - what ? " 
" Have a biscuit , " she repeated impatiently , indicating a tartan tin of cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk . 
He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt , feeling just as confused and wrong footed as he had done on that occasion . 
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge's note and looked very seriously at Harry . 
" Potter , you need to be careful . " 
Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her . 
Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to ; it was not brisk , crisp and stern ; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual . 
" What do you - ? " 
The bell rang for the end of the lesson . 
Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move . 
" It says here she's given you detention every evening this week , starting tomorrow , " Professor McGonagall said , looking down at Umbridge's note again . 
Harry repeated , horrified . 
" But - " 
" She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention . 
You will go to her room at five o ' clock tomorrow for the first one . 
" But I was telling the truth ! " said Harry , outraged . 
" Voldemort is back , you know he is ; Professor Dumbledore knows he is - " 
She stood up , nostrils wide and mouth very thin , and Harry stood up , too . 
" No , thanks , " said Harry coldly . 
" Thanks , " he said grudgingly . 
" Didn't you listen to Dolores Umbridge's speech at the start - of - term feast , Potter ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" Yeah … she said … progress will be prohibited or … well , it meant that … that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts . " 
Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry . 
He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione . 
" Come off it … " 
" Who does he think he's kidding ? " 
" The thing is , Harry , I'm not sure they did , " said Hermione grimly . 
People stared at them all the way out of the Hall . 
" What d ' you mean , you ' re not sure they believed Dumbledore ? " 
" You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric's dead body … none of us saw what happened in the maze … we just had Dumbledore's word for it that You - Know - Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you . " 
" It's just that before the truth could sink in , everyone went home for the summer , where they spent two months reading about how you ' re a nutcase and Dumbledore's going senile ! " 
Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor 
Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week , but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed . 
A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye . 
He glanced out of a rain - washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady's corridor . 
There was still no light in Hagrid's cabin . 
The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it . 
Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them , purring loudly , and when Harry , Ron and Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to Hermione's lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion . 
Harry gazed into the flames , feeling drained and exhausted . 
She pounded the arms of her chair in fury , so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes . 
" And she's trying to get people to spy for her , " said Ron darkly . 
" Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You - Know - Who's back ? " 
They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire . 
Harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole , but could still sense the stares he was attracting . 
" The properties … of moonstone … and its uses … in potion - making … " he muttered , writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them . 
He underlined the title , then looked up expectantly at Hermione . 
" So , what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion - making ? " 
But Hermione was not listening ; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room , where 
Fred , George and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent - looking first years , all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding . 
" Come on , Ron . " 
Harry suggested quietly . 
One by one , as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet , the first - years were slumping unconscious in their seats ; some slid right on to the floor , others merely hung over the arms of their chairs , their tongues lolling out . 
Most of the people watching were laughing ; Hermione , however , squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards , closely observing the unconscious first - years . 
" I told you this morning , you can't test your rubbish on students ! " 
" Yeah , look , they ' re coming round now , " said George . 
Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor , or dangling off their chairs , that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going to do . 
" Feel all right ? " said George kindly to a small dark - haired girl lying at his feet . 
" I - I think so , " she said shakily . 
" Excellent , " said Fred happily , but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands . 
" We're not going to make them ill , we ' ve already tested them all on ourselves , this is just to see if everyone reacts the same - " 
" Put us in detention ? " said Fred , in an I'd - like - to - see - you - try - it voice . 
Hermione drew herself up to her full height ; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity . 
" No , " she said , her voice quivering with anger , " but I will write to your mother . " 
" Oh , yes , I would , " said Hermione grimly . 
" I can't stop you eating the stupid things yourselves , but you ' re not to give them to the first - years . " 
Fred and George looked thunderstruck . 
It was clear that as far as they were concerned , Hermione's threat was way below the belt . 
With a last threatening look at them , she thrust Fred's clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms , and stalked back to her chair by the fire . 
Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees . 
" Thank you for your support , Ron , " Hermione said acidly . 
I'm going to bed . " 
She wrenched her bag open ; Harry thought she was about to put her books away , but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects , placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace , covered them with a few screwed - up bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect . 
I'm a really slow knitter without magic but now I'm back at school I should be able to make lots more . " 
" Yes , " said Hermione defiantly , swinging her bag on to her back . 
" You ' re trying to trick them into picking up the hats . 
You ' re setting them free when they might not want to be free . " 
" Of course they want to be free ! " said Hermione at once , though her face was turning pink . 
She turned on her heel and left . 
Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls'dormitories , then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats . 
" Anyway … " he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape's essay , " there's no point trying to finish this now , I can't do it without Hermione , I haven't got a clue what you ' re supposed to do with moonstones , have you ? " 
Harry shook his head , noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse . 
He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply . 
Knowing perfectly well that when the morning came , he would regret not finishing his homework that night , he piled his books back into his bag . 
He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories , but did not look at him . 
Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak , but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation . 
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee . 
She looked mildly pleased about something , and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy about , she simply said , " The hats have gone . 
Hermione did not speak to him all morning . 
Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of OWLs . 
" What you must remember , " said little Professor Flitwick squeakily perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk , " is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come ! 
If you have not already given serious thought to your careers , now is the time to do so . 
And in the meantime , I'm afraid , we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice ! " 
It was the same , if not worse , in Transfiguration . 
By the end of a double period neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing , though Ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler . 
Hermione , on the other hand , successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt , earning her a ten - point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall . 
She was the only person not given homework ; everybody else was told to practice the spell overnight , ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon . 
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do , Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion - making . 
Still angry about Ron's slur on her woolly hats , Hermione did not join them . 
By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon , Harry's head was aching again . 
The day had become cool and breezy , and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest , they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces . 
Professor Grubbly - Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid's front door , a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs . 
He had clearly just said something highly amusing , because Crabbe , Goyle , Pansy Parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and , judging by the way they all kept looking over at Harry , he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty . 
Who can tell me what these things are called ? " 
She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her . 
Behind her back , Malfoy did a buck - toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question . 
Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream , as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood , each with knobbly brown arms and legs , two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat , barklike face in which a pair of beetle - brown eyes glittered . 
Anyone would have thought Hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures ; admittedly , the Flobberworms had been a bit dull , but the Salamanders and Hippogriffs had been interesting enough , and the Blast - Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so . 
" So - anyone know the names of these creatures ? 
" Bowtruckles , " said Hermione . 
" Five points for Gryffindor , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank . 
" Yes , these are Bowtruckles , and as Miss Granger rightly says , they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality . 
So , whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a Bowtruckle lodges , it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it . 
They may not look dangerous , but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers , which , as you can see , are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs . 
So if you'd like to gather closer , take a few woodlice and a Bowtruckle - I have enough here for one between three - you can study them more closely . 
I want a sketch from each of you with all body - parts labeled by the end of the lesson . " 
Harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly - Plank . 
" Maybe you will if you don't shut up , " said Harry out of the side of his mouth . 
Did Malfoy know something ? 
His father was a Death Eater after all ; what if he had information about Hagrid's fate that had not yet reached the ears of the Order ? 
He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a Bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it . 
Harry pulled out parchment and quill , crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said . 
" Dumbledore would know if some thing had happened to Hagrid , " said Hermione at once . 
We ' ve got to ignore him , Harry . 
" Yes , " came Malfoy's clear drawl from the group nearest them , " Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago , you know , and it sounds as though the Ministry's really determined to crack down on sub - standard teaching in this place . 
" OUCH ! " 
Harry dropped it . 
Crabbe and Goyle , who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked , laughed still harder as the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the Forest , a little moving stick - man soon swallowed up among the tree roots . 
When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds , Harry rolled up his blood - stained Bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in Hermione's handkerchief , and Malfoy's derisive laughter still ringing in his ears . 
Ron laughed , but Hermione frowned . 
" Because she ' ll never be as good as Hagrid , " said Harry firmly , fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it . 
The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth - years spilled out of it , including Ginny . 
" Hi , " she said brightly as she passed . 
A few seconds later , Luna Lovegood emerged , trailing behind the rest of the class , a smudge of earth on her nose , and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head . 
When she saw Harry , her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him . 
Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch . 
Luna took a great breath and then said , without so much as a preliminary hello , " I believe He - Who - Must - Not - BeNamed is back and I believe you fought him and escaped from him . " 
Luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings , a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed , as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes . 
" You can laugh , " Luna said , her voice rising , apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing , " but people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple - Horned Snorkack ! " 
" Oh , for heaven's sake , Harry , you can do better than her , " said Hermione . 
Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too . 
His spirits sank slightly . 
But before he could devote much more thought to the matter , Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him . 
" I want you to know , Potter , " he said in a loud , carrying voice , " that it's not only weirdos who support you . 
I personally believe you one hundred percent . 
My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore , and so do I . " 
Ernie's words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown's face and as he turned to talk to Ron and Hermione , Harry caught Seamus's expression , which looked both confused and defiant . 
To nobody's surprise , Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of OWLs . 
Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this ; he was starting to get an anxious , twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do , a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class . 
Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung , Professor Sprout's preferred type of fertilizer , the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later , none of them talking very much ; it had been another long day . 
As Harry was starving , and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o ' clock , he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him . 
He had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall , however , when a loud and angry voice yelled , " Oy , Potter ! " 
" What ? " said Harry . 
Didn't I tell you I'd booked the Quidditch pitch specially ? 
" I didn't decide not to be there ! " said Harry , stun g by the injustice of these words . 
" I got detention from that Umbridge woman , just because I told her the truth about You - Know - Who . " 
" Well , you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on Friday , " said Angelina fiercely , " and I don't care how you do it . 
She turned on her heel and stormed away . 
" You know what ? " 
Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall . 
You realize we ' ve got to write three essays , practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall , work out a counter - charm for Flitwick , finish the Bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney ? " 
Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling . 
" And it looks like it's going to rain . " 
" What's that got to do with our homework ? " said Hermione , her eyebrows raised . 
At five to five Harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for Umbridge's office on the third floor . 
When he knocked on the door she called , " Come in , " in a sugary voice . 
He entered cautiously , looking around . 
In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself . 
In the impostor Moody's days it had been packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of wrong doing and concealment . 
There were several vases full of dried flowers , each one residing on its own doily , and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates , each decorated with a large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck . 
These were so foul that Harry stared at them , transfixed , until Professor Umbridge spoke again . 
Harry started and looked around . 
He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her . 
" Evening , Professor Umbridge , " Harry said stiffly . 
" Well , sit down , " she said , pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight - backed chair . 
A piece of blank parchment lay on the table , apparently waiting for him . 
" Professor Umbridge . 
Er - before we start , I - I wanted to ask you a … a favor . " 
" Well , I'm … I'm in the Gryffindor Quidditch team . 
And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o ' clock on Friday and I was - was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it - do it another night … instead … " 
He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good . 
" Oh , no , no , no . 
This is your punishment for spreading evil , nasty , attention - seeking stories , Mr . Potter , and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one's convenience . 
No , you will come here at five o ' clock tomorrow , and the next day , and on Friday too , and you will do your detentions as planned . 
I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do . 
It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you . " 
Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears . 
She was watching him with her head slightly to one side , still smiling widely , as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again . 
With a massive effort , Harry looked away from her , dropped his schoolbag beside the straight - backed chair and sat down . 
Now , you are going to be doing some lines for me , Mr . Potter . 
No , not with your quill , " she added , as Harry bent down to open his bag . 
Here you are . " 
" I want you to write , I must not tell lies , " she told him softly . 
" Off you go . " 
" Oh , you won't need ink , " said Professor Umbridge , with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice . 
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote : I must not tell lies . 
The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink . 
At the same time , the words had appeared on the back of Harrys right hand , cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel - yet even as he stared at the shining cut , the skin healed over again , leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth . 
Harry looked round at Umbridge . 
She was watching him , her wide , toadlike mouth stretched in a smile . 
" Yes ? " 
" Nothing , " said Harry quietly . 
He looked back at the parchment , placed the quill on it once more , wrote I must not tell lies , and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time ; once again , the words had been cut into his skin ; once again , they healed over seconds later . 
And on it went . 
Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink , but his own blood . 
And , again and again , the words were cut into the back of his hand , healed , and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment . 
Darkness fell outside Umbridge's window . 
Harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop . 
He knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any , not even if he had to sit there all night , cutting open his own hand with this quill … 
He stood up . 
When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed , but that the skin there was red raw . 
" Hand , " she said . 
He extended it . 
She took it in her own . 
Harry left her office without a word . 
The school was quite deserted ; it was surely past midnight . 
He walked slowly up the corridor , then , when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him , broke into a run . 
He had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells , had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle , nor had he written his essays . 
What did she make you do ? " 
Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second , then said , " Lines . " 
" Nope , " said Harry . 
" No , " said Harry . 
Ron groaned sympathetically . 
It was another bad day for Harry ; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration , not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all . 
He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and , meanwhile , Professors McGonagall , Grubbly - Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework , which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge . 
To cap it all , Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and , on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday's Keeper tryouts , told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments . 
" I'm in detention ! " 
" It's not as if it's a dreadful punishment , really … " 
Harry opened his mouth , closed it again and nodded . 
He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge's room : he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror ; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face . 
He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge , a private battle of wills , and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it . 
Hermione asked him . 
" I was … I fancied a walk , " said Ron shiftily . 
Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment . 
The second detention was just as bad as the previous one . 
The skin on the back of Harry's hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed . 
He let no gasp of pain escape him , however , and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal , again past midnight , he said nothing but " good evening " and " goodnight . " 
His homework situation , however , was now desperate , and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not , though exhausted , go to bed , but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay . 
He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them , cobbled together something on the proper handling of Bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly - Plank , and staggered up to bed , where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately . 
Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness . 
Ron seemed very sleepy too , though Harry could not see why he should be . 
Harry's third detention passed in the same way as the previous two , except that after two hours the words I must not tell lies did not fade from the back of Harrys hand , but remained scratched there , oozing droplets of blood . 
" Ah , " she said softly , moving around her desk to examine his hand herself . 
" Good . 
That ought to serve as a reminder to you , oughtn't it ? 
" Do I still have to come back tomorrow ? " said Harry picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one . 
" Oh yes , " said Professor Umbridge , smiling as widely as before . 
Harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape , but as he walked back towards Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender . 
She's evil , he thought , as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor , she's an evil , twisted , mad old - 
" Ron ? " 
He had reached the top of the stairs , turned right and almost walked into Ron , who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky , clutching his broomstick . 
" What are you doing ? " 
What are you doing ? " 
Harry frowned at him . 
" Come on , you can tell me ! 
What are you hiding here for ? " 
" I'm - I'm hiding from Fred and George , if you must know , " said Ron . " They just went past with a bunch of first - years , I bet they ' re testing stuff on them again . 
I mean , they can't do it in the common room now , can they , not with Hermione there . " 
He was talking in a very fast , feverish way . 
" But what have you got your broom for , you haven't been flying , have you ? " 
Harry asked . 
" I - well - well , okay , I ' ll tell you , but don't laugh , all right ? " 
" I - I thought I'd try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I ' ve got a decent broom . 
Go on . 
" I'm not laughing , " said Harry . 
Ron blinked . 
" It's a brilliant idea ! 
I ' ve never seen you play Keeper , are you good ? " " I'm not bad , " said Ron , who looked immensely relieved at Harry's reaction . 
I ' ve been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me , but it hasn't been easy and I don't know how much use it ' ll be . " 
Ron looked nervous and anxious . 
" Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts . 
" I wish I was going to be there , " said Harry bitterly , as they set off together towards the common room . 
" Yeah , so do - Harry , what's that on the back of your hand ? " 
Harry , who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand , tried to hide it , but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep . 
" It's just a cut - it's nothing - it's - " 
But Ron had grabbed Harry's forearm and pulled the back of Harry's hand up level with his eyes . 
There was a pause , during which he stared at the words carved into the skin , then , looking sick , he released Harry . 
Harry hesitated , but after all , Ron had been honest with him , so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge's office . 
" No , " said Harry at once . 
" Got to you ? 
" Dumbledore , then , tell Dumbledore ! " 
" No , " said Harry flatly . 
" Why not ? " 
" He's got enough on his mind , " said Harry , but that was not the true reason . 
He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since June . 
" Well , I reckon you should - " Ron began , but he was interrupted by the Fat Lady , who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out , " Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation ? " 
Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week . 
Though Harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the Great Hall , it was without any real hope of seeing Hagrid , and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems , such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge . 
One was the thought that it was almost the weekend ; the other was that , dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be , he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might , with luck , be able to see something of Ron's tryout . 
At five o ' clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge's office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time , and was told to enter . 
" You know what to do , Mr . Potter , " said Umbridge , smiling sweetly at him . 
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window . 
If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right … on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table , he managed it . 
He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch , while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts , apparently awaiting their turn to Keep . 
It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance . 
I must not tell lies , Harry wrote . 
The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh . 
I must not tell lies . 
I must not tell lies . 
Blood trickled down his wrist . 
He chanced another glance out of the window . 
Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed . 
Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared to watch . 
Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn't Ron , he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood . 
I must not tell lies . 
I must not tell lies . 
He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it ; when he could hear the scratching of Umbridges quill or the opening of a desk drawer . 
The third person to try out was pretty good , the fourth was terrible , the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save . 
The sky was darkening , and Harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all . 
I must not tell lies . 
I must not tell lies . 
The parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand , which was searing with pain . 
" Let's see if you ' ve gotten the message yet , shall we ? " said Umbridges soft voice half an hour later . 
And then , as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin , pain seared , not across the back of his hand , but across the scar on his forehead . 
At the same time , he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff . 
He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet , staring at her . 
She looked back at him , a smile stretching her wide , slack mouth . 
" Yes , it hurts , doesn't it ? " 
she said softly . 
He did not answer . 
His heart was thumping very hard and fast . 
He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could . 
Stay calm , he told himself , as he sprinted up the stairs . 
" Harry , I did it , I'm in , I'm Keeper ! " 
" What ? 
Oh - brilliant ! " said Harry , trying to smile naturally , while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled . 
" I can't believe it - where's Hermione gone ? " " She's there , " said Fred , who was also swigging Butterbeer , and pointed to an armchair by the fire . 
" Well , she said she was pleased when I told her , " said Ron , looking slightly put out . 
" Let her sleep , " said George hastily . 
" Come here , Ron , and see if Oliver's old robes fit you , " called Katie Bell , " we can take off his name and put yours on instead … " 
" Look , I know he's your best mate , but he's not fabulous , " she said bluntly . 
He comes from a family of good Quidditch players . 
Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening , but Hoopers a real whiner , he's always moaning about something or other , and Vicky's involved in all sorts of societies . 
And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can , okay ? " 
He nodded , and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet . 
" Oh , Harry , it's you … good about Ron , isn't it ? " 
she said blearily . 
" I'm just so - so - so tired , " she yawned . 
" Great , " said Harry distractedly ; if he did not tell somebody soon , he would burst . 
When Harry had finished , she said slowly " You ' re worried You - Know - Who's controlling her like he controlled Quirrell ? " 
" But I don't think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell , I mean , he's properly alive again now , isn't he , he's got his own body , he wouldn't need to share someone else's . 
Harry watched Fred , George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment . 
Then Hermione said , " But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you , and didn't Dumbledore say it had to do with what You - Know - Who was feeling at the time ? 
I mean , maybe this hasn't got anything to do with Umbridge at all , maybe it's just coincidence it happened while you were with her ? " 
" She's evil , " said Harry flatly . 
" She's horrible , yes , but … Harry , I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt . " 
It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron . 
" I'm not bothering him with this . 
" Harry , I'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this - " 
" Harry , you can't put something like that in a letter ! " said Hermione , looking alarmed . 
He got to his feet . 
" I'm going to bed . 
Tell Ron for me , will you ? " 
" Oh no , " said Hermione , looking relieved , " if you ' re going that means I can go too , without being rude . 
I'm absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow . 
Listen , you can help me if you like , it's quite fun , I'm getting better , I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now . " 
" Er … no , I don't think I will , thanks , " he said . 
I ' ve got loads of homework to do … " 
And he traipsed off to the boys'stairs , leaving her looking slightly disappointed . 
Harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning . 
He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight coming through the gap in his four - posters hangings , and savored the thought that it was Saturday . 
Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight , it was just after daybreak . 
He pulled open the curtains around his bed , got up and started to dress . 
The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow , deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors . 
He opened his schoolbag carefully , pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room . 
Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire , Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room . 
The detritus of crumpled - up bits of parchment , old Gobstones , empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone , as were all Hermione's elf hats . 
Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not , Harry uncorked his ink bottle , dipped his quill into it , then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment , thinking hard … but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate , at a complete loss for what to say . 
He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer . 
How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter - thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have ? 
He sat quite motionless for a while , gazing into the fireplace , then , finally coming to a decision , he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment . 
Hope you ' re okay , the first week back here's been terrible , I'm really glad it's the weekend . 
We ' ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , Professor Umbridge . 
She's nearly as nice as your mum . 
I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge . 
We're all missing our biggest friend , we hope he ' ll be back soon . 
Harry 
Harry reread the letter several times , trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider . 
He could not see how they would know what he was talking about - or who he was talking to - just from reading this letter . 
He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back . 
Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts . 
Considering it was a very short letter , it had taken a long time to write ; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above . 
Sealing the parchment carefully , he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery . 
" Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor . " 
I'm off to try and find the Bloody Baron … he might be able to put a stop to it … see you , Harry " 
" Yeah , bye , " said Harry and instead of turning right , he turned left , taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery . 
His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky ; he had training later , he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last . 
Something brushed his ankles . 
He looked down and saw the caretaker's skeletal grey cat , Mrs . Norris , slinking past him . 
She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful . 
" I'm not doing anything wrong , " Harry called after her . 
She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss , yet Harry could not see why ; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning . 
The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes ; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters , a little restless in the early - morning light , some clearly just returned from hunting . 
" There you are , " he said , spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling . 
" Right , I know this says Snuffles on the outside , " he told her , giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and , without knowing exactly why , whispering , " but it's for Sirius , okay ? " 
" Safe flight , then , " said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows ; with a moment's pressure on his arm , Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky . 
He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished , then switched his gaze to Hagrid's hut , clearly visible from this window , and just as clearly uninhabited , the chimney smokeless , the curtains drawn . 
The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze . 
Harry watched them , savoring the fresh air on his face , thinking about Quidditch later … then he saw it . 
A great , reptilian winged horse , just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages , with leathery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's , rose up out of the trees like a grotesque , giant bird . 
The whole thing had happened so quickly , Harry could hardly believe what he had seen , except that his heart was hammering madly . 
The Owlery door opened behind him . 
He leapt in shock and , turning quickly , saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands . 
" Hi , " said Harry automatically . 
She held up the parcel . 
" Right , " said Harry . 
He wanted to say something funny and interesting , but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind . 
" Nice day , " he said , gesturing to the windows . 
He was talking about the weather … 
I haven't been out all week , have you ? " 
" No , " said Harry . 
She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" It's my friend Ron Weasley , d ' you know him ? " 
" Is he any good ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry , " I think so . 
Cho looked up , the parcel only half - attached to the owl's legs . 
Everyone heard about it , it was all over the school . 
Who cared about a stupid flying horse ; Cho thought he had been really brave . 
For a moment , he considered accidentally - on - purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl … but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred , the Owlery door opened again . 
Filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room . 
Mrs . Norris came trotting at his heels , gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily . 
There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion . 
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker . 
" Now hand over whatever it is you ' re sending . " 
Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter , Harry said , " I can't , it's gone . " 
" Gone , " said Harry calmly . 
Filch opened his mouth furiously , mouthed for a few seconds , then raked Harrys robes with his eyes . 
" How do I know you haven't got it in your pocket ? " 
" I saw him send it , " said Cho angrily . 
" You saw him - ? " 
" That's right , I saw him , " she said fiercely . 
There was a moments pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back , then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door . 
He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry . 
" If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . " 
Mrs . Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him . 
Harry and Cho looked at each other . 
" Thanks , " Harry said . 
" No problem , " said Cho , finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl's other leg , her face slightly pink . 
" No , " said Harry . 
" I wonder why he thought you were , then ? " she said as she carried the owl to the window . 
Harry shrugged . 
He was quite as mystified by that as she was , though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment . 
They left the Owlery together . 
At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle , Cho said , " I'm going this way . 
Well , I ' ll … I ' ll see you around , Harry . " 
" Yeah … see you . " 
He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once … you were really brave standing up to her like that … Cho had called him brave … she did not hate him for being alive … Of course , she had preferred Cedric , he knew that … though if he'd only asked her to the Ball before Cedric had , things might have turned out differently … she had seemed sincerely sorry that she'd had to refuse when Harry asked her … 
" Morning , " Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he joined them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall . 
" Oh … yeah … " said Ron . 
He put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice . 
Then he said , " Listen … you don't fancy going out a bit earlier with me , do you ? 
" Yeah , okay , " said Harry . 
" Look , I don't think you should , " said Hermione seriously . 
But she broke off ; the morning post was arriving and , as usual , the Daily Prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl , which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg . 
Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch , took the newspaper , and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off . 
Harry grinned , knowing Ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework . 
" No , " she sighed , " just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married . " 
Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it . 
Ron was staring up at the high windows , looking slightly preoccupied . 
" Wait a moment , " said Hermione suddenly . 
" Oh no … Sirius ! " 
" What's happened ? " said Harry , snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle , with him and Hermione each holding one half . 
" ' The Ministry of Magic has received a tip - off from a reliable source that Sirius Black , notorious mass murderer … blah blah blah … is currently hiding in London ! ' " Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper . 
" He did recognize Sirius on the platform … " 
" What ? " said Ron , looking alarmed . 
" … ' warns wizarding community that Black is very dangerous … killed thirteen people … broke out of Azkaban … ' the usual rubbish , " Hermione concluded , laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron . 
" Dumbledore did warn him not to . " 
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off . 
" Hey ! " he said , flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could see it . 
" I ' ve got all the robes I want , " said Ron . 
" No , " said Harry . 
Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it ; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column . 
It was headlined : 
Sturgis Podmore , 38 , of number two , Laburnum Garden s , Clapham , has appeared in front of the Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31 st August . 
Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch , who found him attempting to force his way through a top - security door at one o ' clock in the morning . 
He's one of the Ord — " 
" Just for trying to get through a door ! " 
What on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o ' clock in the morning ? " breathed Hermione . 
" Wait a moment … " said Harry slowly . 
The other two looked at him . 
" It could be a frame - up ! " 
" The Ministry suspects he's one of Dumbledore's lot so - I dunno - they lured him to the Ministry , and he wasn't trying to get through a door at all ! 
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this . 
Harry thought it seemed farfetched . 
Hermione , on the other hand , looked rather impressed . 
She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully . 
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs , but the sky was a clear , exhilarating blue , and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week … 
She gets too worked up about work , that's her trouble … " There was a pause and he added , in a slightly more anxious tone , " D ' you think she meant it when she said we weren't copying from her ? " 
" Yeah , I do , " said Harry . 
" Still , this is important , too , we ' ve got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team … " 
As they approached the Quidditch pitch , Harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly . 
Nothing flew out of them ; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery tower . 
He had enough to worry about ; the flying horse wasn't doing him any harm ; he pushed it out of his mind . 
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work , Ron guarding the three tall goalposts , Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron . 
Harry thought Ron was pretty good ; he blocked three - quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced . 
After a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunch - during which Hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsible — then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session . 
" Yeah , " said Ron , who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch . 
" Okay , everyone , " said Angelina , entering from the Captain's office , already changed . 
Something in her would - be casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were , and sure enough , when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers - on , who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium . 
" What's that Weasley's riding ? ' " 
Crabbe , Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter . 
" Ignore them , " he said , accelerating to catch up with Ron , " we ' ll see who's laughing after we play them … " 
" Exactly the attitude I want , Harry , " said Angelina approvingly , soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team . 
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch . 
Ron fell back towards the opposite goal . 
Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred , who passed to George , who passed to Harry , who passed to Ron , who dropped it . 
The Slytherins , led by Malfoy , roared and screamed with laughter . 
Ron , who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed , pulled out of the dive untidily , so that he slipped sideways on his broom , and returned to playing height , blushing . 
Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks , but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything , for which he was grateful . 
" Pass it on , Ron , " called Angelina , as though nothing had happened . 
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia , who passed back to Harry , who passed to George … 
George passed to Angelina ; she reverse - passed to Harry , who had not been expecting it , but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron , who lunged for it and missed by inches . 
" Come on now , Ron , " said Angelina crossly , as he dived for the ground again , chasing the Quaffle . 
It would have been hard to say whether Ron's face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height . 
Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter . 
On his third attempt , Ron caught the Quaffle ; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie's outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face . 
" But as you ' re passing to a teammate , do try not to knock her off her broom , won't you ? 
Fred and George converged on Katie . 
" Here , take this , " Fred told her , handing her something small and purple from out of his pocket , " it ' ll clear it up in no time . " 
" All right , " called Angelina , " Fred , George , go and get your bats and a Bludger . 
Ron , get up to the goalposts . 
Harry , release the Snitch when I say so . 
Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch . 
" Ron's making a right pig's ear of things , isn't he ? " muttered George , as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch . 
" He's just nervous , " said Harry , " he was fine when I was practicing with him this morning . " 
They returned to the air . 
When Angelina blew her whistle , Harry released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger . 
From that moment on , Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing . 
It was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker's team and doing so required enormous speed and skill . 
He accelerated , rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers , the warm autumn air whipping his face , and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears … but too soon , the whistle brought him to a halt again . 
Harry looked round at Ron , who was hovering in front of the left - hand hoop , leaving the other two completely unprotected . 
" Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop , or else circle the hoops , but don't drift vaguely off to one side , that's how you let in the last three goals ! " 
Harry glanced round at Fred , who was looking anxious and checking his pockets . 
He saw Fred pull out something purple , examine it for a second and then look round at Katie , evidently horror - struck . 
She was ignoring the Slytherins , who had now set up a chant of " Gryffindor are losers , Gryffindor are losers , " but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless . 
This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelina's whistle sounded . 
" Katie , " she said shortly . 
Harry turned and saw Angelina , Fred and George all flying as fast as they could towards Katie . 
Harry and Alicia sped towards her , too . 
It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time ; Katie was now chalk white and covered in blood . 
" Well , there's no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone , " said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them . 
" Come on , let's go and get changed . " 
asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later , as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room . 
" It was - " Harry began . 
She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to melt . 
" Well , it was only your first one , " she said consolingly , " it's bound to take time to - " 
" Who said it was me who made it lousy ? " 
snapped Ron . 
" No one , " said Hermione , looking taken aback , " I thought - " 
Look , you said it was lousy so I just - " 
" I'm going to get started on some homework , " said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys'dormitories and vanished from sight . 
Hermione turned to Harry . 
" No , " said Harry loyally . 
" Well , I suppose he could ' ve played better , " Harry muttered , " but it was only the first training session , like you said … " 
Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the " Gryffindor are losers " chant out of his head . 
They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room , buried in their books while the room around them filled up , then emptied . 
It was another clear , fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds , enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year . 
By the evening , Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull . 
" You know , we probably should try and get more homework done during the week , " Harry muttered to Ron , as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall's long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra's equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter's many moons . 
Harry glanced over at her ; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her , now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks . 
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker . 
Slowly , the crowd in the common room began to thin again . 
" No , " said Ron shortly . 
" Jupiter's biggest moon is Ganymede , not Callisto , " she said , pointing over Ron's shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay , " and it's lo that's got the volcanoes . " 
" Ron - " 
" I haven't got time to listen to a sermon , all right , Hermione , I'm up to my neck in it here - " 
" No - look ! " 
Hermione was pointing to the nearest window . 
Harry and Ron both looked over . 
A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill , gazing into the room at Ron . 
" Isn't that Hermes ? " said Hermione , sounding amazed . 
" Blimey , it is ! " said Ron quietly , throwing down his quill and getting to his feet . 
He crossed to the window and opened it ; Hermes flew inside , landed on Ron's essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached . 
Ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once , leaving inky footprints across Ron's drawing of the moon lo . 
" That's definitely Percy's handwriting , " said Ron , s inking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll : Ronald Weasley , Gryffindor House , Hogwarts . 
He looked up at the other two . 
" What d ' you reckon ? " 
" Open it ! " said Hermione eagerly , and Harry nodded . 
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read . 
The further down the parchment his eyes traveled , the more pronounced became his scowl . 
When he had finished reading , he looked disgusted . 
He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione , who leaned towards each other to read it together : 
Dear Ron , 
I have only just heard ( from no less a person than the Minister for Magic himself , who has it from your new teacher , Professor Umbridge ) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect . 
I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the ' Fred and George ' route , rather than following in my footsteps , so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility . 
But I want to give you more than congratulations , Ron , I want to give you some advice , which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post . 
Hopefully , you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions . 
Yes , I am sure you are surprised to hear this - no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore's favorite — but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different - and probably more accurate - view of Potter's behavior . 
I shall say no more here , but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing — and see if you can spot yours truly ! 
Seriously , Ron , you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter , it could be very damaging to your future prospects , and I am talking here about life after school , too . 
As you must be aware , given that our father escorted him to court , Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good . 
He got off on a mere technicality , if you ask me , and many of the people I ' ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt . 
It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter - I know that he can be unbalanced and , for all I know , violent - but if you have any worries about this , or have spotted anything else in Potter's behavior that is troubling you , I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge , a truly delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you . 
Your loyalty , Ron , should be not to him , but to the school and the Ministry . 
I am very sorry to hear that , so far , Professor Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires ( although she should find this easier from next week — again , see the Daily Prophet tomorrow ! ) . 
I shall say only this - a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well - placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years ! 
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer . 
It pains me to criticize our parents , but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore . ( If you are writing to Mother at any point , you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore , who is a great friend of Dumbledore's , has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry . 
I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people - the Minister really could not be more gracious to me — and I do hope , Ron , that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents ' beliefs and actions , either . 
I sincerely hope that , in time , they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall , of course , be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes . 
Please think over what I have said most carefully , particularly the bit about Harry Potter , and congratulations again on becoming prefect . 
Percy 
Harry looked up at Ron . 
" Well , " he said , trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke , " if you want to - er - what is it ? " 
" He is - " Ron said jerkily , tearing Percy's letter in half " the world's - " he tore it into quarters " biggest - " he tore it into eighths " git . " 
He threw the pieces into the fire . 
" What ? " said Ron . 
" Give them to me , I ' ll look through them and correct them , " she said . 
" Are you serious ? 
Ah , Hermione , you ' re a life - saver , " said Ron , " what can I - ? " 
" What you can say is , promise we ' ll never leave our homework this late again , " she said , holding out both hands for their essays , but she looked slightly amused all the same . 
" Thanks a million , Hermione , " said Harry weakly , passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair , rubbing his eyes . 
It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks . 
The only sound was that of Hermione's quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table . 
Harry was exhausted . 
He also felt an odd , sick , empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire . 
He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange , even mad ; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months , but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percys writing , about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to Umbridge , that made his situation real to him as nothing else had . 
He had known Percy for four years , had stayed in his house during the summer holidays , shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup , had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year , yet now , Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent . 
And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather , Harry thought Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment , because Sirius was in the same situation . 
Nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years … 
Harry blinked . 
He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there . 
" Okay , write that down , " Hermione said to Ron , pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron , " then add this conclusion I ' ve written for you . " 
" Hermione , you are honestly the most wonderful person I ' ve ever met , " said Ron weakly , " and if I'm ever rude to you again - " 
" - I ' ll know you ' re back to normal , " said Hermione . 
" Harry , yours is okay except for this bit at the end , I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra , Europa's covered in ice , not mice - Harry ? " 
Harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug , gazing into the flames . 
" Er - Harry ? " said Ron uncertainly . 
" Because I ' ve just seen Sirius's head in the fire , " said Harry . 
He spoke quite calmly ; after all , he had seen Sirius's head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it , too ; nevertheless , he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time … it had vanished so quickly … 
Hermione repeated . 
" You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament ? 
She gasped , gazing at the fire ; Ron dropped his quill . 
There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius's head , long dark hair falling around his grinning face . 
Harry said , half - laughing . 
" Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear . " 
" Well , I think a girl - first - year , by the look of her - might ' ve got a glimpse of me earlier , but don't worry " Sirius said hastily , as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth , " I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I ' ll bet she just thought I was an oddly - shaped log or something . " 
At the mention of Harry's letter , Hermione and Ron both turned to stare at him . 
" What about - ? " Ron began , but Hermione interrupted him . 
" Well , I know it can't be fun when it hurts , but we don't think it's anything to really worry about . 
" Yeah , and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion , " said Harry , ignoring , as usual , Ron and Hermione's winces . 
" Well , now he's back it's bound to hurt more often , " said Sirius . 
" I doubt it , " said Sirius . 
" She's foul enough to be one , " said Harry darkly , and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement . 
Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset . 
After all , you are the only member of his family he's got left , and Professor Dumbledore said - " 
" So , what are Umbridge's lessons like ? " Sirius interrupted . 
" That's exactly what he thinks you ' re doing , " said Sirius , " or , rather , that's exactly what he's afraid Dumbledore's doing - forming his own private army , with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic . " 
He's getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day . 
It's a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped - up charge . " 
" D ' you know if there's going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow ? 
" Ah … " said Sirius , " well , he was supposed to be back by now , no one's sure what's happened to him . " 
" But if he was supposed to be back by now … " said Hermione in a small , anxious voice . 
" Madame Maxime was with him , we ' ve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home - but there's nothing to suggest he's hurt or - well , nothing to suggest he's not perfectly okay . " 
Unconvinced , Harry , Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks . 
I was thinking , we got away with the dog disguise at the station , didn't we ? 
I thought I could — " 
" NO ! " said Harry and Hermione together , very loudly . 
" Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you , and his father was on the platform , Sirius - you know , Lucius Malfoy - so don't come up here , whatever you do . 
If Malfoy recognizes you again - " 
He looked most displeased . 
" I would , I just don't want you chucked back in Azkaban ! " said Harry . 
There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry , a crease between his sunken eyes . 
" Well , I'd better get going , I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs , " said Sirius , but Harry was sure he was lying . 
" I ' ll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire , then , shall I ? If you can stand to risk it ? " 
They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter . 
However , the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge , smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline . 
" Umbridge – Inquisitor ? " said Harry darkly , his half - eaten piece of toast slipping from his fingers . 
" What does that maen ? " Hermione rad aloud : 
" In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
" This is not the first time in recent weeks that the Minister , Cornelius Fudge , has used new laws to effect improvements at the wizarding school . 
As recently as August 30 th , Educational Decree Number Twenty - two was passed , to ensure that , in the event of the current Headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post , the Ministry should select an appropriate person . 
' That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts ,'said Weasley last night . 
" She's been a WHAT ? " said Harry loudly . 
" ' — an immediate success , totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on - the - ground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts . ' 
" It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Number Twenty - three , which creates the new position of Hogwarts High Inquisitor . 
" ' This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at Hogwarts ,'said Weasley . 
Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted . ' 
' Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation . ' 
" Among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper , which have included the employment of werewolf Remus Lupin , half - giant Rubeus Hagrid and delusional ex - Auror , ' Mad - Eye ' Moody . 
" Rumors abound , of course , that Albus Dumbledore , once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot , is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts 
" ' I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence ,'said a Ministry insider last night . 
" Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts . 
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two . 
Fudge passed this Decree and forced her on us ! 
And now he's given her the power to inspect the other teachers ! " 
It's outrageous ! " 
" I know it is , " said Harry . 
He looked down at his right hand , clenched on the table - top , and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin . 
" What ? " said Harry and Hermione together , staring at him . 
" Oh , I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected , " said Ron happily . 
But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson , which was just as dull as the previous Monday , nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions , where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large , spiky black ' D'scrawled in an upper corner . 
Snape reached the front of the class and turned on his heel to face them . 
I expect to see a great deal more effort for this weeks essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes , or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a D . " 
Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received ; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible , feeling that he would rather keep that information private . 
Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson , Harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them . 
His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink , like Neville's , and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief . 
" Well , that wasn't as bad as last week , was it ? " said Hermione , as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the Entrance Hall towards lunch . 
" Of course , a lot can happen between now and the exam , we ' ve got plenty of time to improve , but the grades we ' re getting now are a sort of baseline , aren't they ? 
" I don't - I didn't mean - well , if you want to tell me - " 
" Well , that's nothing to be ashamed of , " said Fred , who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right . 
Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll . 
When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about OWL grades . 
They all laughed except Hermione , who ploughed on , " So , after E it's A for ' Acceptable ' , and that's the last pass grade , isn't it ? " 
Harry laughed again , though he was not sure whether or not George was joking . 
He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his OWLs and immediately resolved to work harder from now on . 
" Have you ? " 
" What was it like ? " 
Harry and Hermione asked together . 
Fred shrugged . 
Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard . 
" Who ' ve you got this afternoon ? " 
Fred asked Harry . 
But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge . 
He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and , looking round , he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor . 
The class , which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once . 
Giving the time and date of your inspection ? " 
Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and , looking very disgruntled , turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books . 
Still smiling , Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind 
She then sat down , took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly , waiting for the class to begin . 
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses . 
" Divide into pairs , please , and interpret each other's latest night - time visions with the aid of the Oracle . " 
Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle , watching Umbridge covertly . 
After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake , listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there . 
Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book . 
" Think of a dream , quick , " he told Ron , " in case the old toad comes our way . " 
" Lets say I dreamed I was … drowning Snape in my cauldron . 
Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle . 
" Okay , we ' ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream , the number of letters in the subject … would that be'drowning ' or ' cauldron ' or ' Snape ' ? " 
Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawneys shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary . 
Ron said , immersed in calculations . 
" I dunno , last night , whenever you like , " Harry told him , trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney . 
They were only a table away from him and Ron now . 
Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out . 
Professor Trelawney scowled at her , arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection . 
After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it , she said in a deeply resentful tone , " Nearly sixteen years . " 
" So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you ? " 
" But I think - correct me if I am mistaken - that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of Second Sight ? " 
Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened . 
Professor Trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears . 
" I'd like you to make a prediction for me , " said Professor Umbridge very clearly . 
Harry and Ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their books . 
Most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height , her beads and bangles clinking . 
" I - but - but … wait ! " said Professor Trelawney suddenly , in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice , though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger . 
" I … I think I do see something … something that concerns you … why , I sense something … something dark … some grave peril … " 
Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her , eyebrows raised . 
" I am afraid … I am afraid that you are in grave danger ! " 
There was a pause . 
Professor Umbridge surveyed Professor Trelawney . 
" Well , if that's really the best you can do … " 
She turned away , leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot , her chest heaving . 
Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was : they both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud , but on the other hand , they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawneys side - until she swooped down on them a few seconds later , that is . 
And by the time she had interpreted Harrys dreams at the top of her voice ( all of which , even the ones that involved eating porridge , apparently foretold a gruesome and early death ) , he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her . 
All the while , Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away , making notes on that clipboard , and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first and was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later . 
She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room . 
Harry and Ron told Hermione , who had been in Arithmancy , exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory , but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell . 
" Wands away " she instructed them all with a smile , and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out , sadly returned them to their bags . 
Still smiling her wide , self - satisfied smile , she sat down at her desk . 
The class gave an audible sigh as it turned , as one , to page nineteen . 
Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again . 
Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face , then she bent down and whispered , so that the rest of the class could not hear , " What is it this time , Miss Granger ? " 
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed , against her will . 
" You disagree ? " 
" Yes , I do , " said Hermione , who , unlike Umbridge , was not whispering , but speaking in a clear , carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class . 
" Oh , you do , do you ? " said Professor Umbridge , forgetting to whisper and straightening up . 
" That is enough , " said Professor Umbridge . 
She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them , all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone . 
" What for ? " said Harry angrily . 
" I am here to teach you using a Ministry - approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little . 
Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license , but as none of them - with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell , who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age appropriate subjects - would have passed a Ministry inspection - " " Yeah , Quirrell was a great teacher , " said Harry loudly , " there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head . " 
This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard . 
Then - 
" I think another week's detentions would do you some good , Mr . Potter , " said Umbridge sleekly . 
The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and , by the following morning , it was bleeding again . 
He did not complain during the evening's detention ; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction ; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips , though the cut deepened with every letter . 
The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was , just as George had predicted , Angelinas reaction . 
She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table . 
From whom ? " 
" Are you telling me , " she said , lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear , " that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again ? " 
" Yes , " Harry muttered , speaking to the floor . 
You are heading for serious trouble ! 
" But - what - ? Professor , no ! " Harry said , furious at this injustice , " I'm already being punished by her , why do you have to take points as well ? " 
Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away , upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside Ron , fuming . 
" I know , mate , " said Ron sympathetically , tipping bacon on to Harry's plate , " she's bang out of order . " 
" You think McGonagall was right , do you ? " said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face . 
" I wish she hadn't taken points from you , but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge , " said Hermione's voice , while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page , clearly giving some kind of speech . 
Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms , but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her . 
Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head . 
Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there . 
" Hem , hem , " said Professor Umbridge , employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term . 
Professor McGonagall ignored her . 
" Right then , everyone , listen closely - Dean Thomas , if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention - most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell . 
" Yes ? " said Professor McGonagall , turning round , her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long , severe line . 
" I was just wondering , Professor , whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec — " 
" Obviously I received it , or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom , " said Professor McGonagall , turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge . 
Many of the students exchanged looks of glee . 
" Hem , hem . " 
" I wonder , " said Professor McGonagall in cold fury , turning on Professor Umbridge , " how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me ? 
You see , I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking . " 
Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face . 
She did not speak , but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously . 
" As I was saying : the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished . 
So - you know the incantation , let me see what you can do … " 
Harry muttered to Ron under his breath , but he was grinning - his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated . 
Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney ; perhaps she realized Professor McGonagall would not permit it . 
" Well , it's a start , " said Ron , holding up a long wriggling mouse - tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around . 
As they filed out of the classroom , Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher's desk ; he nudged Ron , who nudged Hermione in turn , and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop . 
" How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts ? " Professor Umbridge asked . 
" Very well , " she said , " you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days ' time . " 
" I can hardly wait , " said Professor McGonagall , in a coldly indifferent voice , and she strode off towards the door . 
" Hurry up , you three , " she added , sweeping Harry , Ron and Hermione before her . 
Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return . 
He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening , but he was wrong . 
When they walked down the lawns towards the Forest for Care of Magical Creatures , they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly - Plank . 
" Quite correct , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank , hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet . 
" I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid . " 
Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione . 
Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle ; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry . 
Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly and watch Umbridge and Grubbly - Plank closely . 
I accepted . 
That's as much as I know . 
" Yes , please do , " said Professor Umbridge , scribbling on her clipboard . 
" Overall , " said Professor Umbridge , returning to Professor Grubbly - Plank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas , " how do you , as a temporary member of staff - an objective outsider , I suppose you might say — how do you find Hogwarts ? 
" Oh , yes , Dumbledore's excellent , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank heartily . 
Harry did not like the emphasis she put on ' you ' and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle . 
Malfoy hastened to answer the question . 
" That was me , " he said . 
" Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do , " said Harry angrily . 
Both Ron and Hermione groaned . 
" Another nights detention , I think , " she said softly . 
" Well , thank you very much , Professor Grubbly - Plank , I think that's all I need here . 
" Jolly good , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank , and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle . 
It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night , his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it . 
He expected the common room to be empty when he returned , but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him . 
Harry placed his bleeding , aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief . 
" Thanks , " he said gratefully , scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand . 
" No , " said Harry flatly . 
" McGonagall would go nuts if she knew — " 
" Yeah , she probably would , " said Harry dully . 
Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and , after a moment , he closed it again , defeated . 
You know , I was just saying to Ron when you came in … we ' ve got to do something about her . " 
" No … I mean , something about what a dreadful teacher she is , and how we ' re not going to learn any Defense from her at all , " said Hermione . 
" Well , what can we do about that ? " said Ron , yawning . 
She's got the job , she's here to stay . 
" You know , I was thinking today … " she shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on , " I was thinking that - maybe the time's come when we should just - just do it ourselves . " 
D ' you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week ? " 
" But this is much more important than homework ! " said Hermione . 
Harry and Ron goggled at her . 
" I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework ! " said Ron . 
" Don't be silly , of course there is , " said Hermione , and Harry saw , with an ominous feeling , that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her . 
" It's about preparing ourselves , like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson , for what's waiting for us out there . 
" We need a teacher , a proper one , who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we ' re going wrong . " 
" No , no , I'm not talking about Lupin , " said Hermione . 
she said . 
" I'm talking about you , Harry . " 
A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron , and the fire guttered . 
" I'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts . " 
Harry stared at her . 
Then he turned to Ron , ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far - fetched schemes like SPEW to Harrys consternation , however , Ron did not look exasperated . 
He was frowning slightly , apparently thinking . 
" What's an idea ? " said Harry . 
" You , " said Ron . " Teaching us to do it . " 
" But … " 
" But I'm not a teacher , I can't - " 
" Harry , you ' re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts , " said Hermione . 
" You beat me in our third year - the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject . 
But I'm not talking about test results , Harry . 
" You know what , I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me , " Ron said to Hermione , smirking slightly . 
He turned to Harry . 
It sounds great when you say it like that , but all that stuff was luck - I didn't know what I was doing half the time , I didn't plan any of it , I just did whatever I could think of , and I nearly always had help - " 
" Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do , I was there , wasn't I ? " he said heatedly . 
And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts , I got through it all because - because help came at the right time , or because I guessed right - but I just blundered through it all , I didn't have a clue what I was doing - STOP LAUGHING ! " 
The bowl of Murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed . 
He became aware that he was on his feet , though he couldn't remember standing up . 
Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished . 
You - neither of you - you ' ve never had to face him , have you ? 
You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him , like you ' re in class or something ? 
The whole time you ' re sure you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own - your own brain or guts or whatever - like you can think straight when you know you ' re about a second from being murdered , or tortured , or watching your friends die - they ' ve never taught us that in their classes , what it's like to deal with things like that - and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here , alive , like Diggory was stupid , like he messed up — you just don't get it , that could just as easily have been me , it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me - " 
" Harry , " she said timidly , " don't you see ? This … this is exactly why we need you … we need to know what it's r - really like … facing him … facing V - Voldemort . " 
Harry could not think of anything to say . 
He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already . 
He nodded , hardly aware of what he was agreeing to . 
Hermione stood up . 
" Well , I'm off to bed , " she said , in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it . 
" Coming ? " he said awkwardly to Harry . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor . 
Ron nodded and left . 
" Reparo , " Harry muttered , pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china . 
They flew back together , good as new , but there was no returning the Murtlap essence to the bowl . 
He was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there , but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed Ron upstairs . 
His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again . 
Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion . 
Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over ( he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely ) ; Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two ; and all three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration ( Hermione had actually progressed to Vanishing kittens ) , before the subject was broached again , on a wild , blustery evening at the end of September , when the three of them were sitting in the library , looking up potion ingredients for Snape . 
Harry did not answer at once . 
He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti - Venoms , because he did not want to say what was in his mind . 
He had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight . 
Sometimes it seemed an insane idea , just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it , but at others , he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters - found himself , in fact , subconsciously planning lessons … 
He looked up at Ron . 
" I thought it was a good idea from the start , " said Ron , who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again . 
" You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck , didn't you ? " 
" Yes , Harry , " said Hermione gently , " but all the same , there's no point pretending that you ' re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts , because you are . 
You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely , you can produce a Patronus , you can do all sorts of stuff that full - grown wizards can't , Viktor always said - " 
" He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't , and he was in the final year at Durmstrang . " 
Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously . 
" I can have a pen - pal if I - " 
Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and , ignoring Ron , who was continuing to watch her , said to Harry , " Well , what do you think ? 
" Just you and Ron , yeah ? " 
" Well … now , don't fly off the handle again , Harry , please … but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn . 
I mean , we ' re talking about defending ourselves against V - Voldemort . 
Oh , don't be pathetic , Ron . 
I'm a nutter , remember ? " 
" Well , I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you ' ve got to say " said Hermione seriously . 
" Look , " she leaned towards him - Ron , who was still watching her with a frown on his face , leaned forwards to listen too - " you know the first weekend in October's a Hogsmeade weekend ? 
" Why do we have to do it outside school ? " said Ron . 
" Because , " said Hermione , returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying , " I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to . " 
Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September ; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying they didn't want him to come - but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway . 
What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in Hogsmeade , perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy ? 
" Well , you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about , " said Ron , when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione . 
" I mean , he's been on the run for over two years , hasn't he , and I know that can't have been a laugh , but at least he was free , wasn't he ? 
Hermione scowled at Ron , but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher . 
" The trouble is , " she said to Harry , " until V - Voldemort - oh , for heaven's sake , Ron - comes out into the open , Sirius is going to have to stay hidden , isn't he ? 
I mean , the stupid Ministry isn't going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore's been telling the truth about him all along . 
" Dumbledore'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn't like what he hears . " 
When Harry continued to look worried , Hermione said , " Listen , Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts , and there are a couple who seem interested . 
" Don't worry , Harry " Hermione said quietly . 
She was quite right , of course , he was barely keeping up with his homework , though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge . 
Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry , because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week , Ron also had his prefect duties . 
However , Hermione , who was taking more subjects than either of them , had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes . 
Harry had to admit that she was getting better ; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks . 
The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy . 
After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch , who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village . 
With a slight pang , Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius , he would not have been going at all . 
Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on , out on to the stone steps and the cold , sunlit day . 
" Er - why was Filch sniffing you ? " asked Ron , as he , Harry and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates . 
" I forgot to tell you … " 
And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later , demanding to see the letter . 
" I dunno , " said Harry , shrugging . 
They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village , the wind whipping their hair into their eyes . 
And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade . 
Harry asked . 
" Oh - no , " said Hermione , coming out of her reverie , " no , it's always packed and really noisy . 
I ' ve told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head , that other pub , you know the one , it's not on the main road . 
They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop , where they were not surprised to see Fred , George and Lee Jordan , past the post office , from which owls issued at regular intervals , and turned up a side - street at the top of which stood a small inn . 
A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door , with a picture on it of a wild boar's severed head , leaking blood on to the white cloth around it . 
The sign creaked in the wind as they approached . 
Harry led the way inside . 
The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room , which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables . 
The floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth , though as Harry stepped on to it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries . 
Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year : " Yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hogs Head " he had said , explaining how he had won a dragon's egg from a hooded stranger there . 
At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter ; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head . 
There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages , though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking , fiery substance through a slit over his mouth ; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows ; Harry might have thought them Dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents , and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick , black veil that fell to her toes . 
They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly . 
" I don't know about this , Hermione , " Harry muttered , as they crossed to the bar . 
" And anyway , even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing she can do to stop us , Harry , because I ' ve double - and triplechecked the school rules . 
We're not out of bounds ; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head , and he said yes , but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses . 
And I ' ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they ' re definitely allowed . 
He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry . 
The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty , very dirty bottles , which he slammed on the bar . 
" Six Sickles , " he said . 
The barman's eyes traveled over Harry , resting for a fraction of a second on his scar . 
Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down , looking around . 
The man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman . 
I bet that bloke would sell us anything , he wouldn't care . 
" Oh , " said Ron , the smile fading from his face . 
The door of the pub had opened . 
A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished , blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people . 
First came Neville with Dean and Lavender , who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with ( Harry's stomach did a back - flip ) Cho and one of her usually - giggling girlfriends , then ( on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident ) Luna Lovegood ; then Katie Bell , Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson , Colin and Dennis Creevey , Ernie Macmillan , Justin Finch - Fletchley , Hannah Abbott , a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know ; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein , Michael Corner and Terry Boot , Ginny , closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and , bringing up the rear , Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan , all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise . 
" What are they expecting ? " 
" I ' ve told you , they just want to hear what you ' ve got to say , " said Hermione soothingly ; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly , " you don't have to do anything yet , I ' ll speak to them first . " 
Harry tried to smile back , but did not speak ; his mouth was exceptionally dry . 
Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right . 
Her friend , who had curly reddish - blonde hair , did not smile , but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that , given her way , she would not be here at all . 
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry , Ron and Hermione , some looking rather excited , others curious , Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space . 
Every eye was upon Harry . 
" Er , " said Hermione , her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves . 
Erm … well , Harry here had the idea - I mean " ( Harry had thrown her a sharp look ) " I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts - and I mean , really study it , you know , not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - " ( Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident ) " - because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts - " ( " Hear , hear , " said Anthony Goldstein , and Hermione looked heartened ) " - Well , I thought it would be good if we , well , took matters into our own hands . " 
She paused , looked sideways at Harry , and went on , " And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly , not just in theory but doing the real spells - " 
" Of course I do , " said Hermione at once . 
" But more than that , I want to be properly trained in defense because … because … " she took a great breath and finished , " because Lord Voldemort is back . " 
Cho's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself ; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch ; Padma Patil shuddered , and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough . 
All of them , however , looked fixedly , even eagerly , at Harry . 
" Well … that's the plan , anyway " said Hermione . 
" Where's the proof You - Know - Who's back ? " said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice . 
" Zacharias Smith , " said the boy , " and I think we ' ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say You - Know - Who's back . " 
" Look , " said Hermione , intervening swiftly , " that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - " 
" It's okay , Hermione , " said Harry . 
Some of these people - maybe even most of them - had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry's story firsthand . 
" I saw him . 
But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year , and if you didn't believe him , you won't believe me , and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone . " 
Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening . 
He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag , making it steadily dirtier . 
Zacharias said dismissively , " All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You - Know - Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts . 
He didn't give us details , he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered , I think we'd all like to know - " 
He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face , and was determined not to look at Cho . " I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory , all right ? 
" So … like I was saying … if you want to learn some defense , then we need to work out how we ' re going to do it , how often we ' re going to meet and where we ' re going to - " 
" Is it true , " interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back , looking at Harry , " that you can produce a Patronus ? " 
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this . 
" She's my auntie , " she said . 
" I'm Susan Bones . 
She told me about your hearing . 
So - is it really true ? 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" That's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year … " 
" Er - yeah , I did , yeah , " said Harry . 
Justin Finch - Fletchley whistled ; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said " Wow ! " softly . 
" And in our first year , " said Neville to the group at large , " he saved that Sorcerous Stone - " " Sorcerer's , " hissed Hermione . 
" Yes , that - from You - Know - Who , " finished Neville . 
Hannah Abbott's eyes were as round as Galleons . 
" And that's not to mention , " said Cho ( Harry's eyes snapped across to her ; she was looking at him , smiling ; his stomach did another somersault ) " all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year - getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things … " 
He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself . 
" Look , " he said , and everyone fell silent at once , " I … I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything , but … I had a lot of help with all that stuff … " 
" No , " said Harry , " no , okay , I know I did bits of it without help , but the point I'm trying to make is - " " Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff ? " said Zacharias Smith . 
In any case , he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him . 
" Well , we ' ve all turned up to learn from him and now he's telling us he can't really do any of it , " he said . 
" That's not what he said , " snarled Fred . 
Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing , though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred's hand . 
I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week - " 
" I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone , " aid Hermione , slightly impatiently , " but you know , this is rather important , we ' re talking about learning to defend ourselves against VVoldemort's Death Eaters - " " Well said ! " barked Ernie Macmillan , who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this . 
" Personally I think this is really important , possibly more important than anything else we ' ll do this year , even with our OWLs coming up ! " 
Obviously , they are in denial about the return of You - Know - Who , but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells - " 
" We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts , " said Hermione , " is that she's got some … some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army . 
" Yes , he's got an army of Heliopaths , " said Luna so lemnly . 
" Yes , he has , " said Luna . 
Just because you ' re so narrow - minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you - " 
" Yes , " said Hermione at once , " yes , we were , you ' re right , Ginny . " 
" Well , the other thing to decide is where we ' re going to meet … " 
But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time . 
" We ' ll send a message round to everybody when we ' ve got a time and a place for the first meeting . " 
She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill , then hesitated , rather as though she was steeling herself to say something . 
" I - I think everybody should write their name down , just so we know who was here . 
But I also think , " she took a deep breath , " that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we ' re doing . 
So if you sign , you ' re agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we ' re up to . " 
Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature , but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list . 
" Er … " said Zacharias slowly , not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him , " well … I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is . " 
" And if this list was found … well , I mean to say … you said yourself , if Umbridge finds out - " 
" You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year , " Harry reminded him . 
" I - yes , " said Ernie , " yes , I do believe that , it's just - " 
" Ernie , do you really think I'd leave that list lying around ? " said Hermione testily . 
" No . 
No , of course not , " said Ernie , looking slightly less anxious . 
" I - yes , of course I ' ll sign . " 
Nobody raised objections after Ernie , though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name . 
When the last person - Zacharias - had signed , Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag . 
" George , Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase , we ' ll be seeing you all later . " 
In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave , too . 
Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving , her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face , but her friend stood beside her , arms folded , clicking her tongue , so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her . 
As her friend ushered her through the door , Cho looked back and waved at Harry . 
" Well , I think that went quite well , " said Hermione happily , as she , Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later . 
" I don't like him much , either , " admitted Hermione , " but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming , so what could I say ? 
But the more people the better really - I mean , Michael Corner and his friends wouldn't have come if he hadn't been going out with Ginny - " 
" They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year , " said Hermione composedly . 
She turned into the shop . 
Harry and Ron followed her . 
" But , " said Ron , following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots , " I thought Ginny fancied Harry ! " 
Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head . 
Not that she doesn't like you , of course , " she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black and gold quill . 
Harry , whose head was still full of Cho's parting wave , did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron , who was positively quivering with indignation , but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered . 
" Exactly , " said Hermione . 
" Yes , I think I ' ll have this one … " 
" What d ' you mean ? 
I'm not going to harp on about anything … " Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street . 
Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone , while Ron was still muttering imprecations about Michael Corner , " And talking about Michael and Ginny … what about Cho and you ? " 
It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him ; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold - had he been that obvious ? 
Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term . 
He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again , and although this could hardly be called fun , the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted , so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake . 
Hermione , who of course was up to date with all her work , brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her , producing more hats and scarves . 
Knowing they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry , and that he was a key part of the rebellion , gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction . 
He kept reliving Saturdays meeting in his mind : all those people , coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts … and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done … and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament – The knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo , but someone to be admired , buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning , despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes . 
He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory , discussing Angelinas idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night's Quidditch practice , and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people . 
A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor noticeboard ; so large it covered everything else on it - the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale , the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch , the Quidditch team training timetable , the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog Cards for others , the Weasleys ' latest advertisement for testers , the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends and the lost and found notices . 
The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official - looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature . 
An organization , society , team , group or club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students . 
Permission to re - form may be sought from the High Inquisitor ( Professor Umbridge ) . 
No student organization , society , team , group or club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor . 
Any student found to have formed , or to belong to , an organization , society , team , group or club that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , High Inquisitor 
Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious - looking second - years . 
Harry was reading the notice through again . 
" She knows . " 
Harry said , looking round at the door to the girls'dormitories . 
" Let's go and tell her , " said Ron . 
He bounded forwards , pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase . 
He was on the sixth stair when there was a loud , wailing , klaxon - like sound and the steps melted together to make a long , smooth stone slid . 
There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running , arms working madly like windmills , then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide , coming to rest on his back at Harry's feet . 
" Er - I don't think we ' re allowed in the girls'dormitories , " said Harry , pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh . 
they giggled happily , leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron . 
" Well , it's an old - fashioned rule , " said Hermione , who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet , " but it says in Hogwarts A History , that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls . 
" To see you - look at this ! " said Ron , dragging her over to the noticeboard . 
Hermione's eyes slid rapidly down the notice . 
" Someone must have blabbed to her ! " Ron said angrily . 
" You ' re so naive , " said Ron , " you think just because you ' re all honorable and trustworthy - " 
It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge's sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower . 
There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville , Dean , Fred , George and Ginny descended upon them . 
" Did you see it ? " 
He glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them . 
" The prefects as well ? " said Fred , looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione . 
" Of course , " said Hermione coolly . 
" Here come Ernie and Hannah Abbott , " said Ron , looking over his shoulder . 
Hermione looked alarmed . 
" Nevermind spots , the idiots can't come over here now , it ' ll look really suspicious - sit down ! " she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah , gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table . 
She hurried off towards the Ravenclaw table ; Harry watched her go . 
Cho was sitting not far away , talking to the curly - haired friend she had brought along to the Hog's Head . 
But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic . 
" Harry ! Ron ! " 
It was Angelina and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate . 
" We have to go and ask permission to re - form the Gryffindor team ! " 
" What ? " said Harry . 
But he was wrong ; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns , floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars . 
Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today ; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione's frequent glares and nudges , until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily . 
" What ? " 
She pointed at the window . 
Harry looked round . 
Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge , gazing through the thick glass at him , a letter tied to her leg . 
Harry could not understand it ; they had just had breakfast , why on earth hadn't she delivered the letter then , as usual ? 
" Oh , I ' ve always loved that owl , she's so beautiful , " Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati . 
He glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes , serenely unaware that the class's attention was even less focused upon him than usual . 
Harry slipped quietly off his chair , crouched down and hurried along the row to the window , where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly . 
He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside , hooting dolefully . 
He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns , crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder . 
He regained his seat , transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg . 
Harry whispered , bending his head low over her . 
Hermione and Ron leaned in closer ; Hermione even put down her quill . 
" Look - there's something wrong with her wing - " 
" Professor Binns , " said Harry loudly , and everyone in the class turned to look at him . 
" I'm not feeling well . " 
Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes , looking amazed , as always , to find the room in front of him full of people . 
" Not at all well , " said Harry firmly getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back . 
" I 
think I need to go to the hospital wing . " 
Once outside the room , Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor , pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns's door . 
His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid , of course , but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly - Plank and hope she would help . 
He peered out of a window at the blustery , overcast grounds . 
There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid's cabin ; if she was not teaching , she was probably in the staff room . 
" Ooooh , urgent , is it ? " said the other gargoyle in a high - pitched voice . 
Harry knocked . 
He heard footsteps , then the door opened and he found himself face to face with Professor McGonagall . 
" I'm looking for Professor Grubbly - Plank , " Harry explained . 
" It's my owl , she's injured . " 
Professor Grubbly - Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall's shoulder , smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet . 
Professor Grubbly - Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched . 
" Hmm , " said Professor Grubbly - Plank , her pipe waggling slightly as she talked . 
" Er , " said Harry . 
He met her eyes briefly and knew , by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle , that she understood ' London'to mean ' number twelve , Grimmauld Place ' . 
Professor Grubbly - Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye , to examine Hedwig's wing closely . 
" Just a moment , Wilhelmina ! " said Professor McGonagall . 
Professor Grubbly - Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying Hedwig , who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this . 
" Potter ! " 
" Yes , Professor ? " 
" Bear in mind , " she said quickly and quietly , her eyes on the scroll in his hand , " that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched , won't you ? " 
" I - " said Harry , but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him . 
Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room , leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd . 
He spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner , their cloak collars turned up against the wind . 
" What ? " said Harry , looking from Ron to Hermione and back again . 
" Well , I was just saying to Ron … what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig ? 
asked Ron , taking the note from Harry . 
" Snuffles "'said Harry quietly . 
Does he mean the fire in the common room ? " 
" I don't know , " said Hermione anxiously , hitching h er bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again , " it wouldn't be exactly difficult to re - seal the scroll by magic … and if anyone's watching the Floo Network … but I don't really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted , too ! " 
They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions , all three of them lost in thought , but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy who was standing just outside Snape's classroom door , waving around an official looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word . 
" Yeah , Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway , I went to ask her first thing this morning . 
" I mean , " said Malfoy , raising his voice a little more , his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction , " if it's a question of influence with the Ministry , I don't think they ' ve got much chance … from what my father says , they ' ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years … and as for Potter … my father says it's a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St . Mungo's … apparently they ' ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic . " 
Malfoy made a grotesque face , his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling . 
" Neville , no ! " 
Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville's robes ; Neville struggled frantically , his fists flailing , trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked , for a moment , extremely shocked . 
" Help me ! " Harry flung at Ron , managing to get an arm around Neville's neck and dragging him backwards , away from the Slytherins . 
Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy , ready for the fight . 
Ron seized Neville's arms , and together he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line . 
The dungeon door opened . 
His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville . 
" Fighting , Potter , Weasley , Longbottom ? " Snape said in his cold , sneering voice . 
Harry did not answer . 
He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St . Mungo's because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville , but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville's secret . 
Even Neville did not know Harry knew . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class , pulled out parchment , quills and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herb s and Fungi . 
" You will notice , " said Snape , in his low , sneering voice , " that we have a guest with us today . " 
He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there , clipboard on her knee . 
He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione , his eyebrows raised . 
Snape and Umbridge , the two teachers he hated most . 
It was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other . 
You will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson ; if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend - instructions - " he waved his wand again " - on the board . 
Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner . 
" Right , " said Harry vaguely , putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner . 
I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus . " 
Harry , watching him closely , added a few drops to his potion ; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange . 
Professor Umbridge asked Snape . 
" Yes , " said Snape quietly . 
" But you were unsuccessful ? " 
" And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school , I believe ? " 
" Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you ? " asked Umbridge . 
" I suggest you ask him , " said Snape jerkily . 
" Oh , I shall , " said Professor Umbridge , with a sweet smile . 
" Oh yes , " said Professor Umbridge , " yes , the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers - er - backgrounds . " 
She turned away , walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons . 
Snape looked round at Harry and their eyes met for a second . 
" You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion , indicating how and why you went wrong , to be handed in next lesson , do you understand ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry furiously . 
Snape had already given them homework and he had Quidditch practice this evening ; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights . 
" Maybe I ' ll skive off Divination , " he said glumly , as they stood in the courtyard after lunch , the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats . 
" I ' ll pretend to be ill and do Snape's essay instead , then I won't have to stay up half the night . " 
" Hark who's talking , you walked out of Divination , you hate Trelawney ! " said Ron indignantly . 
" I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud . 
There was too much truth in this to ignore , so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot , overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom , feeling angry at everybody . 
It seemed , however , that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper . 
Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away , her lips pursed ; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean , narrowly avoiding Seamus's head , and thrust the final one into Neville's chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe . 
" Well , carry on ! " said Professor Trelawney loudly , her voice high - pitched and somewhat hysterical , " you know what to do ! 
Or am I such a sub - standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book ? " 
Harry , however , thought he knew what was the matter . 
As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high - backed teacher's chair , her magnified eyes full of angry tears , he leaned his head closer to Ron's and muttered , " I think she's got the results of her inspection back . " 
" Professor ? " said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice ( she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney ) . 
She gulped , dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl , then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve , and blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry . 
Ron sniggered . 
" Do not speak to me about that woman ! " cried Professor Trelawney , leaping to her feet , her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing . 
" You and Umbridge have got something in common , " Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts . 
" No Quidditch practice , " said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry , Ron and Hermione entered the common room after dinner that night . 
" I didn't say anything to her , Angelina , I swear , I - " 
" I know , I know , " said Angelina miserably . 
" Consider what ? " said Ron angrily . 
But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon . 
" Well , " said Hermione , " look on the bright side - at least now you ' ll have time to do Snape's essay ! " 
snapped Harry , while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione . 
There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room : Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox , which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd . 
First , Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew , at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them . 
Then he would force down the purple end of the chew , at which the vomiting would immediately cease . 
Lee Jordan , who was assisting the demonstration , was lazily Vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harrys potions . 
What with the regular sounds of retching , cheering and the sound of Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd , Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solution . 
Hermione was not helping matters ; the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George's bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs , which Harry found , if anything , more distracting . 
" Just go and stop them , then ! " he said irritably , after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time . 
" They're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy them , not unless they ' re proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn't look as though they are . " 
She , Harry and Ron watched George projectile - vomit into the bucket , gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up , beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause . 
" You know , I don't get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each , " said Harry , watching as Fred , George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd . 
It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed , then Fred , Lee and George sat up counting their takings even longer , so it was well past midnight when Harry , Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves . 
Harry , who was making very little progress with his Potions essay , decided to give it up for the night . 
As he put his books away , Ron , who was dozing lightly in an armchair , gave a muffled grunt , awoke , and looked blearily into the fire . 
" Sirius ! " he said . 
Harry whipped round . 
Siriuss untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again . 
" Hi , " he said , grinning . 
" Hi , " chorused Harry , Ron and Hermione , all three kneeling down on the hearthrug . 
Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire , trying , despite the heat , to put his face close to Sirius's . 
" Not that good , " said Harry , as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers . 
Harry demanded . 
" Who overheard us ? " 
Harry demanded . 
" He was the witch under the veil . " 
Harry said , stunned . 
" I'm still being followed ? " 
asked Harry angrily . 
On the contrary , he was looking at Harry with distinct pride . 
We lost Moody's spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested , so Dung's been dressing as a witch a lot lately … anyway … first of all , Ron - I ' ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother . " 
She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now . 
She also " ( Sirius's eyes turned to the other two ) " advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group , though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart . 
" So it's fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on , because I don't think she trusts me to . " 
There was another pause in which Crookshanks , mewing , attempted to paw Sirius's head , and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug . 
" So , you want me to say I'm not going to take part in the Defense group ? " he muttered finally . 
" I think it's an excellent idea ! " 
" You do ? " said Harry , his heart lifting . 
" Last year , all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you , Harry ! " said Sirius impatiently . 
" This year , we know there's someone outside Hogwarts who'd like to kill us all , so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea ! " 
" Hermione , this whole thing was your idea ! " said Harry , staring at her . 
" I know it was . 
" Well , better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue , " said Sirius . 
" Hear , hear , " said Harry and Ron enthusiastically . 
" So , " said Sirius , " how are you organizing this group ? 
Where are you meeting ? " 
" Hey , that's an idea ! " said Ron excitedly , but Hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at her , Sirius's head turning in the flames . 
" Well , Sirius , it's just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school , " said Hermione , " and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you'd wanted to . 
His face was suddenly tense , alarmed . 
He turned sideways , apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace . 
" Sirius ? " said Harry anxiously . 
But he had vanished . 
Harry gaped at the flames for a moment , then turned to look at Ron and 
Hermione . 
" Why did he - ? " 
A hand had appeared amongst the flames , groping as though to catch hold of something ; a stubby , short - fingered hand covered in ugly old - fashioned rings . 
At the door of the boys'dormitory Harry looked back . 
" Umbridge has been reading your mail , Harry . 
There's no other explanation . " 
" Watch your frog , it's escaping . " 
Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table - " Accio ! " - and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand . 
Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat ; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight . 
Today , with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens , and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows , Harry , Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed . 
Well then , it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch , let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter , then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - I don't think Filch would object , when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights ? 
Harry , you ' re squashing your frog . " 
Silencio . " 
" If she'd caught Snuffles - " 
Harry finished the sentence for her . 
He waved his wand without really concentrating ; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high - pitched whistle . 
" Silencio ! " said Hermione hastily , pointing her wand at Harry's frog , which deflated silently before them . 
" Well , he mustn't do it again , that's all . 
I just don't know how we ' re going to let him know . 
We can't send him an owl . " 
" I don't reckon he ' ll risk it again , " said Ron . " He's not stupid , he knows she nearly got him . 
Silencio . " 
The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw . 
" Silencio . 
SILENCIO ! " 
" Its the way you ' re moving your wand , " said Hermione , watching Ron critically , " you don't want to wave it , it's more a sharp jab . " " Ravens are harder than frogs , " said Ron through clenched teeth . 
" Silencio ! " 
" Very good , Miss Granger ! " said Professor Flitwick's squeaky little voice , making Harry , Ron and Hermione all jump . 
Oh - oh , right , " said Ron , very flustered . 
He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye : the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk . 
They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier , occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody's head . 
They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students . 
" I ' ve got permission ! " she said . 
" Excellent ! " said Ron and Harry together . 
" I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore . 
So I want you down at the pitch at seven o ' clock tonight , all right , because we ' ve got to make up time . 
Ron's smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window , which was now opaque with hammering rain . 
What's up with you , Hermione ? " 
She , too , was gazing at the window , but not as though she really saw it . 
Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face . 
" Just thinking … " she said , still frowning at the rain - washed window . 
" About Siri — Snuffles ? " said Harry . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other . 
Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he was there . 
" I was just wondering , " she said , her voice stronger now , " whether we ' re doing the right thing , starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group . " 
" What ? " said Harry and Ron together . 
" Hermione , it was your idea in the first place ! " said Ron indignantly . 
" I know , " said Hermione , twisting her fingers together . 
" But after talking to Snuffles … " 
" Yes , that's what made me think maybe it wasn't a good idea after all … " 
Peeves floated over them on his stomach , peashooter at the ready ; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed . 
" Let's get this straight , " said Harry angrily , as t hey put their bags back on the floor , " Sirius agrees with us , so you don't think we should do it any more ? " 
Hermione looked tense and rather miserable . 
Now staring at her own hands , she said , " Do you honestly trust his judgment ? " 
" He's always given us great advice ! " 
Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves ; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully . 
You don't think he's … kind of … living through us ? " 
" What d ' you mean , ' through us ' ? " Harry retorted . 
" I mean … well , I think he'd love to be forming secret Defense societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry … I think he's really frustrated at how little he can do where he is … so I think he's keen to kind of … egg us on . " 
Ron looked utterly perplexed . 
" Sirius is right , " he said , " you do sound just like my mother . " 
Hermione bit her lip and did not answer . 
The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down on Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head . 
The weather did not improve as the day wore on , so that at seven o ' clock that evening , when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice , they were soaked through within minutes , their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass . 
The sky was a deep , thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms , even if they knew the respite was only temporary . 
They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying . 
" Does it work ? " 
enquired Ron hopefully , as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building . 
" I can't see any boils , " said Ron , staring at the , twins . 
" All right , everyone , listen up , " said Angelina loudly , emerging from the Captain's office . 
" I know it's not ideal weather , but there's a chance we ' ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it's a good idea to work out how we ' re going to cope with them . 
Harry , didn't you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm ? ' 
" Hermione did it , " said Harry . 
He pulled out his wand , tapped his glasses and said , " Impervius ! " 
" I think we all ought to try that , " said Angelina . 
okay . 
Let's go . " 
They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes , shouldered their brooms and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms . 
They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch ; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm ; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds . 
" All right , on my whistle , " shouted Angelina . 
Harry kicked off from the ground , spraying mud in all directions , and shot upwards , the wind pulling him slightly off course . 
He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather ; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing ; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it . 
Unfortunately , Angelina did not see this . 
The wind was picking up ; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing , pounding sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake . 
Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat . 
She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms , insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time , though without any real conviction in her voice . 
Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he toweled his hair dry . 
" I think a few of mine have ruptured , " said Fred in a hollow voice . 
" OUCH ! " said Harry . 
He pressed the towel to his face , his eyes screwed tight with pain . 
The scar on his forehead had seared again , more painfully than it had in weeks . 
But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside , muffled in their cloaks , their hats pulled low over their ears . 
" What happened ? " said Ron , the moment Alicia had disappeared through the door . 
Harry nodded . 
" But … " looking scared , Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain , " he - he can't be near us now , can he ? " 
" No , " Harry muttered , sinking on to a bench and rubbing his forehead . 
It hurt because … he's … angry . " 
Harry had not meant to say that at all , and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them - yet knew at once that they were true . 
He did not know how he knew it , but he did ; Voldemort , wherever he was , whatever he was doing , was in a towering temper . 
" Did you see him ? " said Ron , looking horrified . 
" Did you … get a vision , or something ? " 
Harry sat quite still , staring at his feet , allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain . 
" He wants something done , and it's not happening fast enough , " he said . 
Again , he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth , and yet was quite certain they were true . 
" But … how do you know ? " said Ron . 
Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands , pressing down upon them with his palms . 
He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him . 
" Is this what it was about last time ? " said Ron in a hushed voice . 
" When your scar hurt in Umbridge's office ? 
You - Know - Who was angry ? " 
Harry shook his head . 
" What is it , then ? " 
Harry was thinking himself back . 
He had been looking into Umbridge's face … his scar had hurt … and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach … a strange , leaping feeling … a happy feeling … but of course , he had not recognized it for what it was , as he had been feeling so miserable himself … 
" Last time , it was because he was pleased , " he said . 
" Really pleased . 
And the night before we came back to Hogwarts … " he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron's bedroom in Grimmauld Place … " he was furious . " 
He looked round at Ron , who was gaping at him . 
" You could take over from Trelawney , mate , " he said in an awed voice . 
" I'm not making prophecies , " said Harry . 
" No , you know what you ' re doing ? " 
" Harry , you ' re reading You - Know - Who's mind ! " 
" No , " said Harry , shaking his head . 
Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year . 
He said that when Voldemort was near me , or when he was feeling hatred , I could tell . 
Well , now I'm feeling it when he's pleased , too … " 
The wind and rain lashed at the building . 
" You ' ve got to tell someone , " said Ron . 
" I told Sirius last time . " 
" Well , tell him about this time ! " 
" Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires , remember ? " 
Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak , watching Harry thoughtfully . 
" Dumbledore'd want to know , " he said . 
Harry shrugged . 
They hurried back through the dark grounds , sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns , not talking . 
Harry was thinking hard . 
" … he's got other plans … plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed … stuff he can only get by stealth … like a weapon . 
Something he didn't have last time . " 
Harry had not thought about those words in weeks ; he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts , too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge , the injustice of all the Ministry interference … but now they came back to him and made him wonder … Voldemort's anger would make sense if he was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon , whatever it was . 
Where was it kept ? 
" Mimbulus mimbletonia , " said Ron's voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room . 
It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early , leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire . 
Harry was rather grateful that she was not around , because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore , too . 
Ron kept throwing him anxious glances , but Harry pulled out his Charms books and set to work on finishing his essay , though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time Ron said he was going up to bed , too , he had written hardly anything . 
Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy - grass , lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it . 
These plants are most efficacious in the inflaming of the brain , and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts , where the wizard is desirous of producing hotheadedness and recklessness … 
… most efficacious in the inflaming of the brain , and are therefore much used … 
… how Harry would like to sleep … 
… it was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire , with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes , Crookshanks purring , and the crackling of the flames … 
As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger , his heart beat fast with excitement … if he could only open it … enter beyond … 
He stretched out his hand … his fingertips were inches from it … 
" Harry Potter , sir ! " 
The candles had all been extinguished in the common room , but there was something moving close by . 
" Whozair ? " said Harry , sitting upright in his chair . 
The fire was almost out , the room very dark . 
" Dobby has your owl , sir ! " said a squeaky voice . 
" Dobby ? " said Harry thickly , peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice . 
Dobby the house - elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left half a dozen of her knitted hats . 
His large , pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats Hermione had ever knitted ; he was wearing one on top of the other , so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet , and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig , hooting serenely and obviously cured . 
" Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter's owl , " said the elf squeakily , with a look of positive adoration on his face , " Professor Grubbly - Plank says she is all well now , sir . " 
He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil - like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and 
" Thanks , Dobby ! " said Harry , stroking Hedwig's head and blinking hard , trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream … it had been very vivid . 
Surveying Dobby more closely , he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks , so that his feet looked far too big for his body . 
" Er … have you been taking all the clothes Hermione's been leaving out ? " 
" Oh , no , sir , " said Dobby happily . 
" Dobby has been taking some for Winky , too , sir . " 
" Yeah , how is Winky ? " asked Harry . 
Dobby's ears drooped slightly . 
" Winky is still drinking lots , sir , " he said sadly , his enormous round green eyes , large as tennis balls , downcast . 
None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more , not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere , they finds them insulting , sir . 
Dobby does it all himself , sir , but Dobby does not mind , sir , for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight , sir , he has got his wish ! " Dobby sank into a deep bow again . 
" But Harry Potter does not seem happy , " Dobby went on , straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry . 
Was Harry Potter having bad dreams ? " 
" Not really bad , " said Harry , yawning and rubbing his eyes . 
The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast , orb - like eyes . 
Then he said very seriously , his ears drooping , " Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter , for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much , much happier now . " 
Harry smiled . 
" You can't help me , Dobby , but thanks for the offer . " 
He bent and picked up his Potions book . 
He'd have to try to finish the essay tomorrow . 
He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand - the result of his detentions with Umbridge … 
" Wait a moment - there is something you can do for me , Dobby , " said Harry slowly . 
The elf looked round , beaming . 
" Name it , Harry Potter , sir ! " 
" I need to find a place where twenty - eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers . 
Especially , " Harry clenched his hand on the book , so that the scars shone pearly white , " Professor Umbridge . " 
He expected the elf's smile to vanish , his ears to droop ; he expected him to say it was impossible , or else that he would try to find somewhere , but his hopes were not high . 
What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip , his ears waggling cheerfully , and clap his hands together . 
" Dobby knows the perfect place , sir ! " he said happily . 
" Dobby heard tell of it from the other house - elves when he came to Hogwarts , sir . 
" Why ? " said Harry curiously . 
" Because it is a room that a person can only enter , " said Dobby seriously , " when they have real need of it . 
Sometimes it is there , and sometimes it is not , but when it appears , it is always equipped for the seeker's needs . 
Dobby has used it , sir , " said the elf , dropping his voice and looking guilty , " when Winky has been very drunk ; he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there , and a nice elf - sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off , sir … and Dobby knows Mr . Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short , sir , and - " 
" And if you really needed a bathroom , " said Harry , suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas , " would it fill itself with chamber pots ? " 
" Dobby expects so , sir , " said Dobby , nodding earnestly . 
" How many people know about it ? " said Harry , sitting up straighter in his chair . 
" Very few , sir . 
Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it , sir , but often they never finds it again , for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service , sir . " 
" It sounds brilliant , " said Harry , his heart racing . 
" It sounds perfect , Dobby . 
" We could go now , if you like ! " 
For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby . 
He was halfway out of his seat , intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when , not for the first time , a voice very much like Hermione's whispered in his ear : reckless . 
It was , after all , very late , he was exhausted , and had Snape's essay to finish . 
Listen , can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is , and how to get in there ? " 
Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology , where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof . 
The afternoons Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm - swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and , to their intense relief , Angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was cancelled . 
" Good , " said Harry quietly , when she told him , " because we ' ve found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting . 
Tonight , eight o ' clock , seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls . 
Can you tell Katie and Alicia ? " 
She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others . 
Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash . 
When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice , he found Hermione watching him . 
" Well … it's just that Dobby's plans aren't always that safe . 
Don't you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm ? " 
" This room isn't just some mad idea of Dobby's ; Dumbledore knows about it , too , he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball . " 
" Dumbledore told you about it ? " 
" Just in passing , " said Harry , shrugging . 
Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog's Head and telling them where to meet that evening . 
Somewhat to Harry's disappointment , it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first ; however , by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty - five people who had turned up in the Hog's Head . 
At half past seven Harry , Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room , Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand . 
Fifth - years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o ' clock , but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor . 
" Hold it , " Harry warned , unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase , tapping it with his wand and muttering , " I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . " 
A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment . 
" Filch is on the second floor , " said Harry , holding the map close to his eyes , " and Mrs . Norris is on the fourth . " 
" And Umbridge ? " said Hermione anxiously . 
They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry , a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet . 
They did so , turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall , then at the mansized vase on its other side . 
Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration ; Hermione was whispering something under her breath ; Harry's fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him . 
We need somewhere to learn to fight … he thought . 
Just give us a place to practice … somewhere they can't find us … 
A highly polished door had appeared in the wall . 
Harry reached out , seized the brass handle , pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below . 
The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor . 
A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes , Secrecy Sensors and a large , cracked Foe - Glass that Harry was sure had hung , the previous year , in the fake Moodys office . 
" A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter - Actions … The Dark Arts Outsmarted … Self - Defensive Spellwork … wow … " She looked around at Harry , her face glowing , and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right . 
And without further ado she slid ' Jinxes for the Jinxed ' from its shelf , sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read . 
There was a gentle knock on the door . 
Harry looked round . 
Ginny , Neville , Lavender , Parvati and Dean had arrived . 
" Whoa , " said Dean , staring around , impressed . 
Harry began to explain , but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again . 
Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock ; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent , looking at him . 
Hermione carefully marked her page of ' Jinxes for the Jinxed ' and set the book aside . 
But it was just a broom cupboard then . " 
asked Dean from the rear of the room , indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe - Glass . 
" Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around , but you don't want to rely on them too much , they can be fooled … " 
He turned his back on it . 
" I think we ought to elect a leader , " said Hermione . 
" Harry's leader , " said Cho at once , looking at Hermione as though she were mad . 
" Yes , but I think we ought to vote on it properly , " said Hermione , unperturbed . 
" It makes it formal and it gives him authority . 
So - everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader ? " 
Everybody put up their hand , even Zacharias Smith , though he did it very half - heartedly . 
" I also think we ought to have a name , " she said brightly , her hand still in the air . 
" Can we be the Anti - Umbridge League ? " said Angelina hopefully . 
" Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group ? " suggested Fred . 
" I was thinking , " said Hermione , frowning at Fred , " more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to , so we can refer to it safely outside meetings . " 
She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters : 
" Right , " said Harry , when she had sat down again , " shall we get practicing then ? 
I was thinking , the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus , you know , the Disarming Charm . 
I know it's pretty basic but I ' ve found it really useful - " 
" Oh , please , " said Zacharias Smith , rolling his eye s and folding his arms . 
" I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You - Know - Who , do you ? " 
" I ' ve used it against him , " said Harry quietly . 
" It saved my life in June . " 
The rest of the room was very quiet . 
" But if you think it's beneath you , you can leave , " Harry said . 
Smith did not move . 
" Okay , " said Harry , his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him , " I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice . " 
Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up . 
The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus . 
Wands flew in all directions ; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air . 
Harry was too quick for Neville , whose wand went spinning out of his hand , hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf , from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm . 
" Expelliarmus ! " said Neville , and Harry , caught unawares , felt his wand fly out of his hand . 
" I ' ve never done it before - I DID IT ! " 
" Listen , Neville , can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing ? " 
Harry moved off into the middle of the room . 
Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith . 
Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein , his own wand would fly out of his hand , yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound . 
Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery : Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back . 
" Sorry , Harry " said George hastily , when Harry caught his eye . 
Harry walked around the other pairs , trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong . 
Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner ; she was doing very well , whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her . 
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily , giving his partner time to get in under his guard ; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them ; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy , occasionally sending Justin Finch - Fletchley's wand spinning out of his hand , at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end . 
Harry shouted . 
" Stop ! 
I need a whistle , he thought , and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books . 
He caught it up and blew hard . 
He moved off around the room again , stopping here and there to make suggestions . 
He avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while , but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer . 
I - oh , sorry , Marietta ! " 
Her curly - haired friend's sleeve had caught fire ; Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault . 
" That was quite good , " Harry lied , but when she raised her eyebrows he said , " Well , no , it was lousy , but I know you can do it properly , I was watching from over there . " 
She laughed . 
Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away . 
" She doesn't really want to be here but I made her come with me . 
Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge . 
You see - her mum works for the Ministry . " 
" What about your parents ? " asked Harry . 
" But if they think I'm not going to fight You - Know - Who after what happened to Cedric - " 
She broke off , looking rather confused , and an awkward silence fell between them ; Terry Boot's wand went whizzing past Harry's ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose . 
" Well , my dad is very supportive of any anti - Ministry action ! " said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry ; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch - Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head . 
And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons , which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him . 
And then there's his Umgubular Slashkilter — " 
She giggled . 
" Hey , Harry , " Hermione called from the other end of the room , " have you checked the time ? " 
He looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine , which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out of bounds . 
" Expelliarmus " and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor . 
" Well , that was pretty good , " said Harry , " but we ' ve overrun , we'd better leave it here . 
Same time , same place next week ? " 
" Sooner !'said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement . 
Angelina , however , said quickly . 
" Let's say next Wednesday night , then , " said Harry , " we can decide on additional meetings then . 
He pulled out the Marauder's Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor . 
He let them all leave in threes and fours , watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories : the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens ; the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle , and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the Fat Lady's portrait . 
" That was really , really good , Harry " said Hermione , when finally it was just her , Harry and Ron who were left . 
" Yeah , it was ! " said Ron enthusiastically , as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them . 
" Did you see me disarm Hermione , Harry ? " 
They argued all the way back to the common room , but Harry was not listening to them . 
He and the D . A . were resisting her under her very nose , doing the very thing she and the Ministry most feared , and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard's book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings , remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed Hermione , how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings ' hard effort , how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust . 
He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the D . A . meetings , as they had to accommodate three separate team's Quidditch practices , which were often rearranged due to bad weather conditions ; but Harry was not sorry about this ; he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable . 
Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice , because it would look suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often . 
She gave each of the members of the D . A . a fake Galleon ( Ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold ) . 
" You see the numerals around the edge of the coins ? " 
The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches . 
On these fake coins , though , the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting . 
We take one each , and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he ' ll change the numbers on his coin , and because I ' ve put a Protean Charm on them , they ' ll all change to mimic his . " 
" Yes , " said Hermione . 
Harry looked sideways at Hermione . 
The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game ; the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome , for they , of course , would be playing both teams over the coming year ; and the Heads of House of the competing teams , though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship , were determined to see their own side victorious . 
Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly , " I ' ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study , boys , and I really don't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape , so use the extra time to practice , won't you ? " 
He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors . 
When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth , Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair - thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eye - witnesses who insisted they had seen the Slytherin Keeper , Miles Bletchley , hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library . 
On the other hand , Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form ; during one memorable practice he had hung one - handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end ; the rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan , the Irish International Keeper , against Poland's top Chaser , Ladislaw Zamojski . 
The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch . 
October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived , cold as frozen iron , with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands and faces . 
The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale , pearly grey , the mountains around Hogwarts were snowcapped , and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many students wore their thick protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons . 
Harry looked round and saw that , in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats , every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown . 
They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table , where everyone was wearing red and gold , but far from raising Ron's spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale ; he collapsed on to the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal . 
Ron turned a tortured face to Harry . 
Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red and gold scarves , gloves and rosettes . 
" And you , Harry - " 
He seemed too distracted to notice much around him , but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown - shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table , and this time he made out the words etched on to them : 
Entrance Hall , down the stone steps and out into the icy air . 
There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white , which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes . 
Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered . 
Harry and Ron pulled on their robes ( Ron attempted to do his up back - to - front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help ) , then sat down to listen to the pre - match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle towards the pitch . 
" Well , they don't look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other , " said Angelina , pocketing her parchment , " but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way on to the pitch without signposts . " 
Harry zoomed higher , dodging a Bludger , and set off on a wide lap of the pitch , gazing around for a glint of gold ; on the other side of the stadium , Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same . 
" - just a fun fact , Professor , adds a bit of interest - and she's ducked Warrington , she's passed Montague , she's — ouch - been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe … Montague catches the Quaffle , Montague heading back up the pitch and - nice Bludger there from George Weasley , that's a Bludger to the head for Montague , he drops the Quaffle , caught by Katie Bell , Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse - passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet's away - " 
Lee Jordan's commentary rang through the stadium and Harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd , all yelling and booing and singing . 
And as Lee paused to listen , the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands : 
" Weasley was born in a bin He always lets the Quaffle in Weasley will make sure we win Weasley is our King . " 
Bletchley , the Slytherin Keeper , had saved the goal ; he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it , zig - zagging in between Alicia and Katie ; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron . 
" Weasley is our King , Weasley is our King , He always lets the Quaffle in Weasley is our King . " 
Harry could not help himself : abandoning his search for the Snitch , he wheeled around to watch Ron , a lone figure at the far end of the pitch , hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted towards him . 
Harry realized he had been stationary in midair for over a minute , watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch ; horrified , he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again , staring around , trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium : 
There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked ; Malfoy was still circling the stadium just as he was . 
Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal hoops , willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron's end . 
Looking down , Harry saw the pug - faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands , her back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring : 
Harry ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch , keeping one eye on Malfoy in case he showed signs of having spotted it , but Malfoy , like him , was continuing to soar around the stadium , searching fruitlessly … 
But Harry had seen it at last : the tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch . 
The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off towards the other side of the stands ; its change of direction suited Malfoy , who was nearer ; Harry pulled his Firebolt around , he and Malfoy were now neck and neck … 
Luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground , having dived so low to catch the Snitch , but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch . 
He turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one , yelling and punching the air in triumph ; all except Ron , who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and seemed to be making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone . 
Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about . 
Harry and George entered . 
" Well , actually , Minerva , " simpered Professor Umbridge , " I think you ' ll find that what I think does count . 
Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces ; the team themselves were slumped around the fire , all apart from Ron , who had not been seen since the end of the match . 
Harry sprinted up to the boys'dormitories to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk ; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls'dormitories , wearing scarf , gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats . 
" Well , it's cold out there ! " she said defensively , as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently . 
They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak - Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing - then , moving slowly and cautiously , they proceeded down the many staircases , pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of Filch or Mrs . Norris . 
They were lucky ; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick , who was gliding along absent - mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like Weasley is our King . 
They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent , snowy grounds . 
With a great leap of his heart , Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney . 
They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door . 
When Harry raised his fist and knocked three times , a dog started barking frantically inside . 
Harry called through the keyhole . 
" Shoulda known ! " said a gruff voice . 
" Bin home three seconds … out the way , Fang … out the way , yeh dozy dog … " 
The bolt was drawn back , the door creaked open and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap . 
Hermione screamed . 
" I'm sorry ! " Hermione gasped , as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them . 
" I just - oh , Hagrid ! " 
" It's nuthin ' , it's nuthin ' ! " said Hagrid hastily , shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains , but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror . 
Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising . 
There were many cuts on his face and hands , some of them still bleeding , and he was moving gingerly , which made Harry suspect broken ribs . 
It was obvious that he had only just got home ; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door . 
Hagrid himself , twice the size of a normal man , was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it . 
" What happened to you ? " Harry demanded , while Fang danced around them all , trying to lick their faces . 
" I'm tellin ' yeh , I'm fine , " said Hagrid , straightening up and turning to beam at them all , but wincing . 
" Hagrid , you ' ve been attacked ! " said Ron . 
" Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ? " Ron demanded . 
" You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey , Hagrid , " said Hermione anxiously , " some of those cuts look nasty . " 
He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it . 
Underneath was a raw , bloody , green - tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire . 
" You ' re not going to eat that , are you , Hagrid ? " said Ron , leaning in for a closer look . 
" It's s ' posed ter look like that , it's dragon meat , " Hagrid said . 
He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face . 
" So , are you going to tell us what's happened to you ? " Harry asked . 
" Can't , Harry . 
Top secret . 
" Did the giants beat you up , Hagrid ? " asked Hermione quietly . 
Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest . 
" Giants ? " said Hagrid , catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face , " who said anythin ' abou ' giants ? 
" We guessed , " said Hermione apologetically . 
" It was kind of … obvious , " said Ron . 
Harry nodded . 
Hagrid glared at them , then snorted , threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle , which was now whistling . 
But his beard twitched . 
" So you have been to look for giants ? " said Harry , grinning as he sat down at the table . 
Hagrid set tea in front of each of them , sat down , picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face . 
" And you found them ? " said Hermione in a hushed voice . 
" Where are they ? " said Ron . 
" They do , " said Hagrid darkly . 
He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising . 
" Come on , Hagrid , tell us what you ' ve been up to ! " said Ron . " Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the Dementors - " 
Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time ; a large quantity of spit , tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid , with a soft splat , on to the floor . 
" Didn't you know ? " Hermione asked him , wide - eyed . 
" I don ' know anythin'that's bin happenin'since I left . 
" Yeah , I am , they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me , and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me - " 
" - and I had to go to a hearing and everything , but tell us about the giants first . " 
" Tell us about your summer and I ' ll tell you about mine . " 
Harry looked right back , an expression of innocent determination on his face . 
" Oh , all righ ' , " Hagrid said in a resigned voice . 
He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth . 
" Oh , Hagrid , don't , it's not hygien — " Hermione began , but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye . 
He took another fortifying gulp of tea , then said , " Well , we set off righ ' after term ended - " 
Hermione interjected . 
" Yeah , tha's righ ' , " said Hagrid , and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak . 
" Yeah , it was jus ' the pair of us . 
" You knew where you were going ? " 
Harry repeated . 
" Well , Dumbledore knew , an ' he told us , " said Hagrid . 
" Are they hidden ? " 
asked Ron . 
" Is it a secret , where they are ? " 
" Not really " said Hagrid , shaking his shaggy head . 
" It's jus ' that mos ' wizards aren ' bothered where they are ,'s long as it's a good long way away . 
Took us abou ' a month ter get there - " 
" A month ? " said Ron , as though he had never heard o f a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time . 
There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he surveyed Ron ; it was almost pitying . 
" We're bein ' watched , Ron , " he said gruffly . 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" Yeh don ' understand , " said Hagrid . 
" We know about that , " said Harry quickly keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story , " we know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore - " 
" So you couldn't use magic to get there ? " 
asked Ron , looking thunderstruck , " you had to act like Muggles all the way ? " 
" Well , not exactly all the way " said Hagrid cagily . 
" We jus ' had ter be careful , ' cause Olympe an ' me , we stick out a bit — " Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea . 
" Ooooh , Dijon ? " said Hermione excitedly . 
" I ' ve been there on holiday , did you see - ? " 
Ran inter a couple o ' mad trolls on the Polish border an ' I had a sligh'disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk , bu ' apart from tha ' couldn't ' a bin smoother . 
" An'then we reached the place , an ' we started trekkin ' up through the mountains , lookin ' fer signs of ' em … 
Hagrid paused for a long draught of tea . 
" Go on ! " said Harry urgently . 
" How big are they ? " 
asked Ron in a hushed voice . 
" Bout twenty feet , " said Hagrid casually . 
" And how many were there ? " asked Harry . 
" Is that all ? " said Hermione . 
Wizards killed a few , o ' course , bu ' mostly they killed each other , an ' now they ' re dyin ' out faster than ever . 
" So , " said Harry , " you saw them and then what ? " 
We didn'dare sleep . 
" Oh , the Gurg - means the chief . " 
" How could you tell which one was the Gurg ? " asked Ron . 
Hagrid grunted in amusement . 
" No problem , " he said . 
" He was the biggest , the ugliest an'the laziest . 
" And you just walked up to him ? " said Hermione breathlessly . 
" Well … down ter him , where he was lyin ' in the valley . 
They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains , see , beside a mountain lake , an ' Karkus was lyin ' by the lake roarin ' at the others ter feed him an ' his wife . 
Olympe an ' I went down the mountainside - " 
" But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you ? " asked Ron incredulously . 
" What do you give a giant ? " asked Ron eagerly . 
Giants like magic , jus'don ' like us usin ' it against ' em . 
Anyway , that firs'day we gave ' im a branch o ' Gubraithian fire . " 
Hermione said , " Wow ! " 
softly , but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement . 
" Well , anyway , " said Hagrid quickly , intervening before Ron could answer back , " Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore , which isn'somethin ' any wizard could do , an'so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says , ' A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore , who sends his respectful greetings . ' " 
" And what did Karkus say ? " asked Harry eagerly . 
" Nothin ' , " said Hagrid . 
" And did he like the present ? " asked Ron . 
" Oh yeah , it went down a storm once they understood what it was , " said Hagrid , turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye . 
So then I said , Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift . " 
" Why couldn't you speak to them that day ? " asked Hermione . 
We ' ll come back tomorrow with another present , an'then we do come back with another present - gives a good impression , see ? 
In any case , giants like Karkus - overload ' em with information an'they ' ll kill yeh jus ' to simplify things . 
So we bowed outta the way an ' went off an ' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an'the followin ' mornin ' we went back an'this time we found Karkus sittin ' up waitin ' fer us lookin ' all eager . " 
" And you talked to him ? " 
" What did he say ? " 
" Not much , " said Hagrid . 
We were hopeful when we left that day . 
Promised ter come back next mornin ' with another present … 
" Bu ' that night it all wen ' wrong . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " said Ron quickly . 
They can ' help themselves , they half kill each other every few weeks . 
The men fight each other an'the women fight each other ; the remnants of the old tribes fight each other , an'that's even without squabbles over food an'the best fires an'sleepin'spots . 
" That night a fight broke out , we saw it from the mouth of our cave , lookin'down on the valley . 
An ' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an ' his head was lyin ' at the bottom o ' the lake . " 
" Karkus's , " said Hagrid heavily . 
" Well , we hadn ' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs ' one , an ' we had a funny feelin ' Golgomath wouldn ' be so keen ter listen to us , bu ' we had ter try . " 
" You went to speak to him ? " asked Ron incredulously . 
" After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head ? " 
" Course we did , " said Hagrid , " we hadn ' gone all that way ter give up after two days ! 
We wen'down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus . 
" I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth . 
He was sitting there wearin ' Karkus's helmet , leerin ' at us as we got nearer . 
He's massive , one o ' the biggest ones there . 
Well , I gave it a go - held out a great roll o'dragon skin - an'said , ' gift fer the Gurg of the giants — ' Nex ' thing I knew , I was hangin ' upside - down in the air by me feet , two of his mates had grabbed me . " 
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth . 
" How did you get out of that ? " asked Harry . 
Hit the two holdin ' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an'they dropped me straightaway - bu ' we were in trouble then , ' cause we'd used magic against ' em , an'that's what giants hate abou ' wizards . 
" Blimey , Hagrid , " said Ron quietly . 
" So , how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days ? " 
asked Hermione . 
" We didn ' leave after three days ! " said Hagrid , looking outraged . 
" But you ' ve just said there was no way you could go back ! " 
" No , " said Hagrid , " I wish he had . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" I mean we soon found out he didn ' object ter all wizards - just us . " 
" Death Eaters ? " said Harry quickly . 
" How d ' you know they were Death Eaters ? " said Ron . 
Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak ? 
Maniac , he is . 
We had ter try an ' persuade some o ' the others , the ones who hadn ' wanted Golgomath as Gurg . " 
" How could you tell which ones they were ? " 
asked Ron . 
" Well , they were the ones bein ' beaten to a pulp , weren'they ? " said Hagrid patiently . 
So we decided we'd go pokin ' round the caves by night an'see if we couldn ' persuade a few o ' them . " 
" You went poking around dark caves looking for giants ? " said Ron , with awed respect in his voice . 
" Well , it wasn'the giants who worried us most , " said Hagrid . 
Dumbledore had told us before we wen ' not ter tangle with ' em if we could avoid it , an'the trouble was they knew we was around —'spect Golgomath told ' em abou ' us . 
At night , when the giants were sleepin ' an ' we wanted ter be creepin ' inter the caves , Macnair an'the other one were sneakin ' round the mountains lookin ' fer us . 
I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin ' out at ' em , " said Hagrid , the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard , " she was rarin'ter attack ' em … she's somethin ' when she's roused , Olympe … fiery , yeh know …'spect it's the French in her … " 
Hagrid gazed misty - eyed into the fire . 
" So , what happened ? 
Did you ever get near any of the other giants ? " 
" What ? 
Yeah , on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin ' in an ' headed back down inter the gully , keepin ' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters . 
" Cave must ' ve been cramped , " said Ron . 
" Wasn ' room ter swing a Kneazle , " said Hagrid . 
" Didn't they attack you when they saw you ? " asked Hermione . 
" Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition , " said Hagrid , " but they was badly hurt , all three o ' them ; Golgomath's lot had beaten ' em unconscious ; they'd woken up an ' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find . 
But Hermione said , " What do you mean ' one point ' , Hagrid ? " 
Hagrid looked at her sadly . 
" Golgomath's lot raided the caves . 
" Nope , " said Hagrid , heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face , " but we did wha ' we meant ter do , we g ave ' em Dumbledore's message an'some o ' them heard it an ' I spect some o ' them ' ll remember it . 
Jus ' maybe , them that don ' want ter stay around Golgomath ' ll move outta the mountains , an'there's gotta be a chance they ' ll remember Dumbledore's friendly to ' em … could be they ' ll come . " 
Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through : Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap . 
" Hagrid ? " said Hermione quietly after a while . 
" Did you … was there any sign of … did you hear anything about your … your … mother while you were there ? " 
Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared . 
" I'm sorry … I … forget it - " 
" Dead , " Hagrid grunted . 
They told me . " 
" Oh … I'm … I'm really sorry " said Hermione in a very small voice . 
Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders . 
" No need , " he said shortly . 
They were silent again . 
Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron , plainly wanting them to speak . 
" But you still haven't explained how you got in this state , Hagrid , " Ron said , gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face . 
" Or why you ' re back so late , " said Harry . 
" Who attacked you ? " said Ron . 
" I haven ' bin attacked ! " said Hagrid emphatically . 
" I - " 
But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door . 
Hermione gasped ; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor ; Fang yelped . 
All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway . 
The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain . 
Harry said quickly ; seizing the Invisibility Cloak , he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well . 
Fang was barking madly at the door . 
Hagrid looked thoroughly confused . 
" Hagrid , hide our mugs ! " 
Hagrid seized Harry and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket . 
Fang was now leaping up at the door ; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open . 
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps . 
Lips pursed , she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face ; she barely reached his navel . 
" So , " she said slowly and loudly , as though speaking to somebody deaf . 
" You ' re Hagrid , are you ? " 
Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room , her bulging eyes rolling in every direction . 
" Get away , " she snapped , waving her handbag at Fang , who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face . 
" Er - I don ' want ter be rude , " said Hagrid , staring at her , " but who the ruddy hell are you ? " 
" My name is Dolores Umbridge . " 
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin . 
Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood , sandwiched between Ron and Hermione . 
" Dolores Umbridge ? " 
Hagrid said , sounding thoroughly confused . 
" I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister , yes , " said Umbridge , now pacing around the cabin , taking in every tiny detail within , from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak . 
" I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher - " 
" Wha's that ? " said Hagrid , frowning . 
" Precisely what I was going to ask , " said Umbridge , pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug . 
So I had ter use this one instead . " 
" I heard voices , " she said quietly . 
" I was talkin'ter Fang , " said Hagrid stoutly . 
" And was he talking back to you ? " 
" There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin , " said Umbridge sleekly . 
Hermione gasped ; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth . 
Luckily , Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes and she did not appear to have heard . 
" Well , I on ' y jus ' got back , " said Hagrid , waving an enormous hand at the haversack . 
" Well , I … I don ' know why that'd be … " said Hagrid , tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where Harry , Ron and Hermione stood , as though asking for help . 
Umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin , looking around carefully . 
She bent and peered under the bed . 
She opened Hagrid's cupboards . 
She passed within two inches of where Harry , Ron and Hermione stood pressed against the wall ; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by . 
After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking , she wheeled round again and said , " What has happened to you ? 
Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face , which in Harrys opinion was a mistake , because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible , not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face . 
" Oh , I … had a bit of an accident , " he said lamely . 
" What sort of accident ? " 
" I - I tripped . " 
" Yeah , tha's right . 
I don ' fly , meself . 
" Where have you been ? " asked Umbridge , cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling . 
" Where ' ve I - ? " 
" Been , yes , " she said . 
" Term started two months ago . 
Where have you been ? " 
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye . 
Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously . 
" I - I ' ve been away for me health , " he said . 
Her eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face ; dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat . 
" I see . " 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid , " bit o ' - o ' fresh air , yeh know - " 
" Yes , as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by , " said Umbridge sweetly . 
The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple , flushed . 
" Mountain scenery ? " said Umbridge swiftly . 
She knows , Harry thought desperately . 
Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out . 
Umbridge looked at him coldly ; his smile faltered . 
Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said , " I shall , of course , be informing the Minister of your late return . " 
" Righ ' , " said Hagrid , nodding . 
" You ought to know , too , that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers . 
So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough . " 
She turned sharply and marched back to the door . 
" You ' re inspectin ' us ? " Hagrid repeated blankly , looking after her . 
" Oh , yes , " said Umbridge softly , looking back at him with her hand on the door handle . 
She left , closing the door behind her with a snap . 
" Not yet , " she breathed in his ear . 
" She might not be gone yet . " 
Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way ; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so . 
" She's goin ' back ter the castle , " he said in a low voice . 
" Oh , don ' you worry abou ' that , I ' ve got a great load o ' lessons planned , " said Hagrid enthusiastically , scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again . 
" Erm … special in what way ? " asked Hermione tentatively . 
" I'm not sayin ' , " said Hagrid happily . 
" Hagrid , you ' ve got to pass Umbridge's inspection , and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after Porlocks , how to tell the difference between Knarls and hedgehogs , stuff like that ! " said Hermione earnestly . 
" But tha's not very interestin ' , Hermione , " said Hagrid . 
I ' ve bin bringin ' ' em on fer years , I reckon I ' ve got the on ' y domestic herd in Britain . " 
" Hagrid … please … " said Hermione , a note of real desperation in her voice . 
" Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore . 
But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one - eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner . 
" Lis ' en , it's bin a long day an ' it's late , " he said , patting Hermione gently on the shoulder , so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud . 
" Oh - sorry - " He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes . 
" I dunno if you got through to him , " said Ron a sho rt while later when , having checked that the coast was clear , they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow , leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went . 
" Then I ' ll go back again tomorrow , " said Hermione determinedly . 
" I ' ll plan his lessons for him if I have to . 
I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not getting rid of Hagrid ! " 
Hermione ploughed her way back to Hagrid's cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning . 
Harry and Ron wanted to go with her , but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again , so they remained grudgingly in the common room , trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside , where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake , tobogganing and , worst of all , bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows . 
" Oy ! " bellowed Ron , finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window , " I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window - OUCH ! " 
He withdrew his head sharply , his face covered in snow . 
" It's Fred and George , " he said bitterly , slamming the window behind him . 
Hermione returned from Hagrid's just before lunch , shivering slightly , her robes damp to the knees . 
" So ? " said Ron , looking up when she entered . 
And then he came stumping out of the Forest - " 
Harry groaned . 
The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack . 
" What's he keeping in there ? 
Did he say ? " he asked . 
" No , " said Hermione miserably . 
" He says he wants them to be a surprise . 
I tried to explain about Umbridge , but he just doesn't get it . 
He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study Knarls than Chimaeras - oh , I don't think he's got a Chimaera , " she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron's faces , " but that's not for lack of trying , from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs . 
I don't know how many times I told him he'd be better off following Grubbly - Plank's plan , I honestly don't think he listened to half of what I said . 
He's in a bit of a funny mood , you know . 
Hagrid's reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students . 
Some , like Fred , George and Lee , roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid's enormous hand ; others , like Parvati and Lavender , exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads . 
Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly - Plank's lessons , and the worst of it was that a very small , unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason : Grubbly - Plank's idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off . 
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry , Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrid's on Tuesday , heavily muffled against the cold . 
Harry was worried , not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them , but also about how the rest of the class , particularly Malfoy and his cronies , would behave if Umbridge was watching them . 
However , the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards Hagrid , who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest . 
He did not present a reassuring sight ; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding . 
Harry could not understand this : had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing ? 
As though to complete the ominous picture , Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder . 
Hagrid called happily to the approaching students , jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him . 
" What prefers the dark ? " 
Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle , a trace of panic in his voice . 
" What did he say prefers the dark - did you hear ? " 
Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now ; he had not been very brave then , either . 
He smiled to himself ; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him . 
" Ready ? " said Hagrid cheerfully , looking around at the class . 
Thought we'd go an'see these creatures in their natural habitat . 
" And you ' re sure they ' re trained , are you ? " said Malfoy , the panic in his voice even more pronounced . 
" Course they ' re trained , " said Hagrid , scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder . 
" So what happened to your face , then ? " demanded Malfoy . 
He turned and strode straight into the Forest . 
Nobody seemed much disposed to follow . 
Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione , who sighed but nodded , and the three of them set off after Hagrid , leading the rest of the class . 
They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground . 
With a grunt , Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground , stepped back and turned to face his class , most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him , peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment . 
He turned , shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd , shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird . 
Nobody laughed : most of them looked too scared to make a sound . 
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again . 
A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming . 
And then , as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest , Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees . 
A pair of blank , white , shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face , neck and then skeletal body of a great , black , winged horse emerged from the darkness . 
It surveyed the class for a few seconds , swishing its long black tail , then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs . 
A great wave of relief broke over Harry . 
He looked eagerly at Ron , but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered , " Why doesn't Hagrid call again ? " 
Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them . 
There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them : a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face ; and Neville , whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail . 
" Oh , an ' here comes another one ! " said Hagrid proudly , as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees , folded its leathery wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat . 
Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses , Harry raised his hand . 
Hagrid nodded at him . 
" Excuse me , " said Malfoy in a sneering voice , " but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing ? " 
For an answer , Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground . 
The whole class stared at it for a few seconds , then several people gasped and Parvati squealed . 
" What's doing it ? " 
" What's eating it ? " 
" Thestrals , " said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft " Oh ! " of comprehension at Harry's shoulder . 
Now , who knows - ? " 
Professor Trelawney told me once - " 
Two more horses came quietly out of the trees , one of them passing very close to Parvati , who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree , saying , " I think I felt something , I think it's near me ! " 
" Don ' worry , it won ' hurt yen , " said Hagrid patiently . 
" Righ ' , now , who can tell me why some o ' yeh can see ' em an'some can't ? " 
Hermione raised her hand . 
" Go on then , " said Hagrid , beaming at her . 
" The only people who can see Thestrals , " she said , " are people who have seen death . " 
" Tha's exactly right , " said Hagrid solemnly , " ten points ter Gryffindor . 
Now , Thestrals - " 
" Hem , hem . " 
Professor Umbridge had arrived . 
She was standing a few feet away from Harry , wearing her green hat and cloak again , her clipboard at the ready . 
Hagrid , who had never heard Umbridge's fake cough before , was gazing in some concern at the closest Thestral , evidently under the impression that it had made the sound . 
" Hem , hem . " 
" Oh , hello ! " Hagrid said , smiling , having located the source of the noise . 
" You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning ? " said Umbridge , in the same loud , slow voice she had used with him earlier , as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow . 
" Oh , yeah , " said Hagrid brightly . 
Well , as you can see - or , I dunno - can you ? 
" What did you say ? " 
Hagrid looked a little confused . 
" Er - Thestrals ! " he said loudly . 
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard : " Has … to … resort … to … crude … sign … language . " 
" Well … anyway … " said Hagrid , turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered , " erm … what was I sayin ' ? " 
" Appears … to … have … poor … short … term … memory , " muttered Umbridge , loudly enough for everyone to hear her . 
Yeah , so , we started off with a male an ' five females . 
This one , " he patted the fir st horse to have appeared , " name o ' Tenebrus , he's my special favorite , firs ' one born here in the Forest - " 
" Are you aware , " Umbridge said loudly , interrupting him , " that the Ministry of Magic has classified Thestrals as'dangerous ' ? " 
Harry's heart sank like a stone , but Hagrid merely chuckled . 
" I mean , a dog ' ll bite if yeh bait it , won ' it - but Thestrals have jus ' got a bad reputation because o ' the death thing - people used ter think they were bad omens , didn'they ? 
Umbridge did not answer ; she finished writing her last note , then looked up at Hagrid and said , again very loudly and slowly , " Please continue teaching as usual . 
I am going to walk , " she mimed walking ( Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter ) " among the students " ( she pointed around at individual members of the class ) " and ask them questions . " 
Hagrid stared at her , clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English . 
Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now . 
" I know what you ' re doing , you awful , twisted , vicious - " 
The few unbruised bits of Hagrid's face flushed , but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy's answer . 
" Assuming they can understand you , of course , " said Malfoy loudly , and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles . 
Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville . 
" You can see the Thestrals , Longbottom , can you ? " she said . 
Neville nodded . 
" My … my grandad , " said Neville . 
" And what do you think of them ? " she said , waving her stubby hand at the horses , who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone . 
" Erm , " said Neville nervously , with a glance at Hagrid . 
" No ! " said Neville , looking upset . 
" No , I'm not scared of them ! " 
" It's quite all right , " said Umbridge , patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile , though it looked more like a leer to Harry . 
" Well , Hagrid , " she turned to look up at him again , speaking once more in that loud , slow voice , " I think I ' ve got enough to be getting along with . 
You will receive " ( she mimed taking something from the air in front of her ) " the results of your inspection " ( she pointed at the clipboard ) " in ten days ' time . " 
She held up ten stubby little fingers , then , her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat , she bustled from their midst , leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter , Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking confused and upset . 
stormed Hermione half an hour later , as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow . 
It's her thing about half - breeds all over again - she's trying to make out Hagrid's some kind of dimwitted troll , just because he had a giantess for a mother - and oh , it's not fair , that really wasn't a bad lesson at all - I mean , all right , if it had been Blast - Ended Skrewts again , but Thestrals are fine - in fact , for Hagrid , they ' re really good ! " 
" Umbridge said they ' re dangerous , " said Ron . 
" Well , it's like Hagrid said , they can look after themselves , " said Hermione impatiently , " and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly - Plank wouldn't usually show them to us before NEWT level , but , well , they are very interesting , aren't they ? 
The way some people can see them and some can't ! 
I wish I could . " 
" Do you ? " 
Harry asked her quietly . 
She looked suddenly horrorstruck . 
" Oh , Harry - I'm sorry - no , of course I don't - that was a really stupid thing to say . " 
" It's okay , " he said quickly , " don't worry " 
" I'm surprised so many people could see them , " said Ron . " Three in a class - " 
" Yeah , Weasley , we were just wondering , " said a malicious voice . 
Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow , Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them . 
" D ' you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you'd be able to see the Quaffle better ? " 
He , Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle , then broke into a chorus of " Weasley is our King " . 
" Ignore them , just ignore them , " intoned Hermione , pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again , so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses . 
December arrived , bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth - years . 
They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle ( " You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it , " said Ron ) , to watch over first - and second - years spending their break - times inside because of the bitter cold ( " And they ' re cheeky little snot - rags , you know , we definitely weren't that rude when we were in first year , " said Ron ) and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch , who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels ( " He's got dung for brains , that one , " said Ron furiously ) . 
They were so busy that Hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three . 
Harry , who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made , bent lower over his History of Magic essay . 
In any case , he did not want to think about Christmas . 
For the first time in his school career , he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts . 
Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation , he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment . 
The only thing he really looked forward to were the D . A . meetings , and they would have to stop over the holidays , as nearly everybody in the D . A . would be spending the time with their families . 
Hermione was going skiing with her parents , something that greatly amused Ron , who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains . 
Ron was going home to The Burrow . 
Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said , in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas : " But you ' re coming too ! 
Hermione rolled her eyes , but Harry's spirits soared : the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful , though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius . 
He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs . Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities . 
Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway , he could not help but think Mrs . Weasley might not want him ; they were so often at loggerheads . 
Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire , and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him , he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house , perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher . 
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D . A . meeting before the holidays andwas very glad he had , because when the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas . 
He could tell the elf had done it , because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling , each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend : HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS ! 
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Love good entered , looking as dreamy as always . 
" Hello , " she said vaguely , looking around at what remained of the decorations . 
" No , " said Harry , " it was Dobby the house - elf . " 
" Mistletoe , " said Luna dreamily , pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head . 
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles were by the arrival of Angelina , Katie and Alicia . 
" Well , " said Angelina dully , pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner , " we ' ve finally replaced you . " 
" Replaced me ? " said Harry blankly . 
" You and Fred and George , " she said impatiently . 
" Who ? " said Harry quickly . 
" Ginny Weasley , " said Katie . 
Harry gaped at her . 
" Yeah , I know , " said Angelina , pulling out her wand and flexing her arm , " but she's pretty good , actually . 
Nothing on you , of course , " she said , throwing him a very dirty look , " but as we can't have you … " 
Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter : did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did ? 
" And what about the Beaters ? " he asked , trying to keep his voice even . 
" Andrew Kirke , " said Alicia without enthusiasm , " and Jack Sloper . 
Neither of them are brilliant , but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up … " 
The arrival of Ron , Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end , and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina's burning , reproachful looks . 
" Okay , " he said , calling them all to order . 
" I thought this evening we should just go over the things we ' ve done so far , because it's the last meeting before the holidays and there's no point starting anything new right before a three - week break - " 
" We're not doing anything new ? " said Zacharias Smith , in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room . 
" If I'd known that , I wouldn't have come . " 
Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach , as though he had missed a step going downstairs . 
" - we can practice in pairs , " said Harry . 
" We ' ll start with the Impediment Jinx , for ten minutes , then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again . " 
The room was soon full of intermittent cries of " Impedimenta ! " 
People froze f or a minute or so , during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work , then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx . 
After a while , when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row , he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others . 
When he passed Cho she beamed at him ; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times . 
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx , they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again . 
Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once ; half the group observed the others for a while , then swapped over . 
True , Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean , at whom he had been aiming , but it was a much closer miss than usual , and everybody else had made enormous progress . 
" When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff - maybe even Patronuses . " 
There was a murmur of excitement . 
The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes ; most people wished Harry a " Happy Christmas " as they went . 
Feeling cheerful , he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away . 
Ron and Hermione left before he did ; he hung back a little , because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a " Merry Christmas " from her . 
" No , you go on , " he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam's apple . 
He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room , tears pouring down her face . 
He didn't know what to do . 
She was simply standing there , crying silently . 
" What's up ? " he said , feebly . 
She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve . 
" I'm - sorry , " she said thickly . 
" I suppose … it's just … learning all this stuff … it just makes me … wonder whether … if he'd known it all … he'd still be alive . " 
Harry's heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel . 
She wanted to talk about Cedric . 
" He did know this stuff , " Harry said heavily . 
" He was really good at it , or he could never have got to the middle of that maze . 
But if Voldemort really wants to kill you , you don't stand a chance . " 
" You survived when you were just a baby , " she said quietly . 
" Yeah , well , " said Harry wearily , moving towards the door , " I dunno why nor does anyone else , so it's nothing to be proud of . " 
" I'm really sorry to get all upset like this … I didn't mean to … " 
She hiccoughed again . 
She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy . 
Harry felt thoroughly miserable . 
He'd have been so pleased with just a " Merry Christmas " . 
" I know it must be horrible for you , " she said , mop ping her eyes on her sleeve again . 
" Me mentioning Cedric , when you saw him die … I suppose you just want to forget about it ? " 
Harry did not say anything to this ; it was quite true , but he felt heartless saying it . 
" You ' re a r - really good teacher , you know , " said Cho , with a watery smile . 
" I ' ve never been able to Stun anything before . " 
" Thanks , " said Harry awkwardly . 
They looked at each other for a long moment . 
Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and , at the same time , a complete inability to move his feet . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" What are Nargles ? " 
" No idea , " said Harry . 
She had moved closer . 
" You'd have to ask Loony . 
Luna , I mean . " 
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh . 
He could have counted the freckles on her nose . 
" I really like you , Harry . " 
He could not think . 
She was much too close . 
He returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire ; nearly everybody else had gone to bed . 
Hermione was writing a very long letter ; she had already filled half a roll of parchment , which was dangling from the edge of the table . 
Ron was lying on the hearthrug , trying to finish his Transfiguration homework . 
" What kept you ? " he asked , as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione's . 
Harry didn't answer . 
He was in a state of shock . 
Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened , but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave . 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " Hermione asked , peering at him over the tip of her quill . 
" What's up ? " said Ron , hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry . 
" What's happened ? " 
Harry didn't quite know how to set about telling them , and still wasn't sure whether he wanted to . 
Just as he had decided not to say anything , Hermione took matters out of his hands . 
" Did she corner you after the meeting ? " 
Numbly surprised , Harry nodded . 
" So - er - what did she want ? " he asked in a mock casual voice . 
" She - " Harry began , rather hoarsely ; he cleared his throat and tried again . 
" Did you kiss ? " asked Hermione briskly . 
Ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug . 
Harry looked from Ron's expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione's slight frown , and nodded . 
" HA ! " 
Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid - looking second - years over beside the window jump . 
A reluctant grin spread over Harry's face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug . 
Hermione gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter . 
" Well ? " Ron said finally , looking up at Harry . 
" How was it ? " 
Harry considered for a moment . 
" Wet , " he said truthfully . 
" Because she was crying , " Harry continued heavily . 
" Oh , " said Ron , his smile fading slightly . 
" Maybe I am . " 
" Of course you ' re not , " said Hermione absently , still scribbling away at her letter . 
" How do you know ? " said Ron very sharply . 
" She does it at mealtimes , in the loos , all over the place . " 
" Ron , " said Hermione in a dignified voice , dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot , " you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet . " 
" What's that supposed to mean ? " said Ron indignantly . 
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face . 
" Don't you understand how Cho's feeling at the moment ? " 
she asked . 
" No , " said Harry and Ron together . 
Hermione sighed and laid down her quill . 
Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry , and she can't work out who she likes best . 
Then she ' ll be feeling guilty , thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all , and she ' ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry . 
And she probably can't work out what her feelings towards Harry are , anyway , because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died , so that's all very mixed up and painful . 
Oh , and she's afraid she's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she's been flying so badly . " 
A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech , then Ron said , " One person can't feel all that at once , they'd explode . " 
" Just because you ' ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have , " said Hermione nastily picking up her quill again . 
" She was the one who started it , " said Harry . 
" I wouldn't ' ve - she just sort of came at me - and next thing she's crying all over me - I didn't know what to do — " 
" You just had to be nice to her , " said Hermione , looking up anxiously . 
" You were , weren't you ? " 
" Are you going to see her again ? " 
" I ' ll have to , won't I ? " said Harry . 
" You know what I mean , " said Hermione impatiently . 
Harry said nothing . 
Hermione's words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities . 
He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho — Hogsmeade , perhaps - and being alone with her for hours at a time . 
" Oh well , " said Hermione distantly , buried in her letter once more , " you ' ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her . " 
" What if he doesn't want to ask her ? " said Ron , who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face . 
" Don't be silly , " said Hermione vaguely , " Harry's liked her for ages , haven't you , Harry ? " 
He did not answer . 
" Who ' re you writing the novel to , anyway ? " 
Ron asked Hermione , trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor . 
Hermione hitched it up out of sight . 
" Viktor . " 
" Krum ? " 
" How many other Viktors do we know ? " 
Ron said nothing , but looked disgruntled . 
They sat in silence for another twenty minutes , Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings - out , Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment , rolling it up carefully and sealing it , and Harry staring into the fire , wishing more than anything that Sirius's head would appear there and give him some advice about girls . 
But the fire merely crackled lower and lower , until the red - hot embers crumbled into ash and , looking around , Harry saw that they were , yet again , the last ones in the common room . 
" Well , night , " said Hermione , yawning widely as she set off up the girls'staircase . 
" What does she see in Krum ? " Ron demanded , as he and Harry climbed the boys'stairs . 
" Well , " said Harry , considering the matter , " I s ' pose he's older , isn't he … and he's an international Quidditch player … " 
" I mean , he's a grouchy git , isn't he ? " 
They pulled off their robes and put on pajamass in silence ; Dean , Seamus and Neville were already asleep . 
Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his four - poster ; instead , he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville's bed . 
" Night , " said Harry . 
Maybe next time … if there was a next time … she'd be a bit happier . 
He ought to have asked her out ; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him … or was she lying in bed , still crying about Cedric ? 
He did not know what to think . 
Hermione's explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand . 
An owl hooted somewhere out in the night . 
Harry dreamed he was back in the D . A . room . 
Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences ; she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she showed up . 
And she pulled out fistfuls of Cards from in side her robes and threw them into the air . 
Then she turned into Hermione , who said , " You did promise her , you know , Harry … I think you'd better give her something else instead … how about your Firebolt ? " 
And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt , because Umbridge had it , and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous , he'd only come to the D . A . room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby's head … 
He was gliding between shining metal bars , across dark , cold stone … he was flat against the floor , sliding along on his belly … it was dark , yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange , vibrant colors … he was turning his head … at first glance the corridor was empty … but no … a man was sitting on the floor ahead , his chin drooping on to his chest , his outline gleaming in the dark … 
Harry put out his tongue … he tasted the man's scent on the air … he was alive but drowsy … sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor … 
Harry longed to bite the man … but he must master the impulse … he had more important work to do … 
But the man was stirring … a silver Cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet ; and Harry saw his vibrant , blurred outline towering above him , saw a wand withdrawn from a belt … he had no choice … he reared high from the floor and struck once , twice , three times , plunging his fangs deeply into the man's flesh , feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws , feeling the warm gush of blood … 
The man was yelling in pain … then he fell silent … he slumped backwards against the wall … blood was splattering on to the floor … 
" Harry ! HARRY ! " 
He opened his eyes . 
Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat ; his bed covers were twisted all around him like a strait - jacket ; he felt as though a white - hot poker were being applied to his forehead . 
" Harry ! " 
Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened . 
There were more figures at the foot of Harry's bed . 
He clutched his head in his hands ; the pain was blinding him … he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress . 
" Should we call someone ? " 
" Harry ! Harry ! " 
He had to tell Ron , it was very important that he tell him … taking great gulps of air , Harry pushed himself up in bed , willing himself not to throw up again , the pain half - blinding him . 
" What ? " said Ron uncomprehendingly . 
" Your dad ! 
He's been bitten , it's serious , there was blood everywhere … " 
" I'm going for help , " said the same scared voice , and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory . 
" Harry , mate , " said Ron uncertainly , " you … you were just dreaming … " 
" No ! " said Harry furiously ; it was crucial that Ron understand . 
" It wasn't a dream … not an ordinary dream … I was there , I saw it … I did it … " 
He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care . 
The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly , though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly . 
He retched again and Ron leapt backwards out of the way . 
" Harry , you ' re not well , " he said shakily . 
" I'm fine ! " 
Harry choked , wiping his mouth on his p yjamas and shaking uncontrollably . 
" There's nothing wrong with me , it's your dad you ' ve got to worry about - we need to find out where he is - he's bleeding like mad - I was - it was a huge snake . " 
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it ; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby . 
Whether one minute passed or ten , Harry did not know ; he simply sat there shaking , feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar … then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard Neville's voice again . 
Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown , her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose . 
" What is it , Potter ? 
Where does it hurt ? " 
He had never been so pleased to see her ; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now , not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions . 
" It's Ron's dad , " he said , sitting up again . 
" He's been attacked by a snake and it's serious , I saw it happen . " 
" What do you mean , you saw it happen ? " said Professor McGonagall , her dark eyebrows contracting . 
" I don't know … I was asleep and then I was there … " 
" You mean you dreamed this ? " 
Mr . Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake , there was a load of blood , he collapsed , someone's got to find out where he is … " 
Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing . 
" I'm not lying and I'm not mad ! " 
Harry told her , his voice rising to a shout . 
" I tell you , I saw it happen ! " 
" I believe you , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall curtly . 
Harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate , but jumped out of bed at once , pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose . 
" Weasley , you ought to come too , " said Professor McGonagall . 
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville , Dean and Seamus , out of the dormitory , down the spiral stairs into the common room , through the portrait hole and off along the Fat Lady's moonlit corridor . 
Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment ; he wanted to run , to yell for Dumbledore ; Mr . Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately , and what if those fangs ( Harry tried hard not to think ' my fangs ' ) had been poisonous ? 
Mrs Norris slunk away into the shadows , and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office . 
" Fizzing Whizzbee , " said Professor McGonagall . 
The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside ; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator . 
The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs ; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin . 
Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room , a positive babble of them . 
It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people . 
Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off . 
The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside . 
The room was in half - darkness ; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did ; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames . 
Behind the door , a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing . 
" Oh , it's you , Professor McGonagall … and … ah . " 
Dumbledore was sitting in a high - backed chair behind his desk ; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him . 
He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt , but seemed wideawake , his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall . 
" Professor Dumbledore , Potter has had a … well , a nightmare , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" It wasn't a nightmare , " said Harry quickly . 
Professor McGonagall looked round at Harry , frowning slightly . 
" I … well , I was asleep … " said Harry and , even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand , he felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him , but examining his own interlocked fingers . 
" But it wasn't an ordinary dream … it was real … I saw it happen … " He took a deep breath , " Ron's dad - Mr . Weasley - has been attacked by a giant snake . " 
The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them , sounding slightly ridiculous , even comic . 
There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling . 
Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore , white - faced and shocked . 
" How did you see this ? " Dumbledore asked quietly , still not looking at Harry . 
" Well … I don't know , " said Harry , rather angrily - what did it matter ? 
" I mean … can you remember — er - where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen ? 
Were you perhaps standing beside the victim , or else looking down on the scene from above ? " 
This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore ; it was almost as though he knew … 
" I was the snake , " he said . 
" I saw it all from the snake's point of view . " 
Nobody else spoke for a moment , then Dumbledore , now looking at Ron who was still wheyfaced , asked in a new and sharper voice , " Is Arthur seriously injured ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry emphatically - why were they all so slow on the uptake , did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side ? 
And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him ? 
But Dumbledore stood up , so quickly it made Harry jump , and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling . 
" Everard ? " he said sharply . 
A sallow - faced wizard with a short black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him , both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps , opened their eyes immediately . 
" You were listening ? " said Dumbledore . 
The wizard nodded ; the witch said , " Naturally . " 
" The man has red hair and glasses , " said Dumbledore . " Everard , you will need to raise the alarm , make sure he is found by the right people - " Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames , but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures ( as usually happened at Hogwarts ) neither reappeared . 
One frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain , the other a handsome leather armchair . 
Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls , though snoring and drooling most convincingly , kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids , and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked . 
" Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts's most celebrated Heads , " Dumbledore said , now sweeping around Harry , Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door . 
As they are free to move between their own portraits , they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere … " 
" But Mr . Weasley could be anywhere ! " said Harry . 
" Please sit down , all three of you , " said Dumbledore , as though Harry had not spoken , " Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes . 
Professor McGonagall , if you could draw up extra chairs . " 
Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it ; three chairs appeared out of thin air , straight - backed and wooden , quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry's hearing . 
Harry sat down , watching Dumbledore over his shoulder . 
Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes's plumed golden head with one finger . 
The phoenix awoke immediately . 
He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright , dark eyes . 
" We will need , " Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird , " a warning . " 
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone . 
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known , carried it over to his desk , sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand . 
Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top . 
After a few seconds , the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air … a serpent's head grew out of the end of it , opening its mouth wide . 
Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story : he looked eagerly at 
Dumbledore for a sign that he was right , but Dumbledore did not look up . 
" Naturally , naturally , " murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself , still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise . 
Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question . 
The smoke serpent , however , split itself instantly into two snakes , both coiling and undulating in the dark air . 
With a look of grim satisfaction , Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand : the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint , became a formless haze and vanished . 
Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes , then , realizing that Harry was watching them , hastily pretend to be sleeping again . 
Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for , but before he could do so , there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right ; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait , panting slightly . 
" Dumbledore ! " 
" What news ? " said Dumbledore at once . 
" I yelled until someone came running , " said the wizard , who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him , " said I'd heard something moving downstairs - they weren't sure whether to believe me but went down to check - you know there are no portraits down there to watch from . 
Anyway , they carried him up a few minutes later . 
He doesn't look good , he's covered in blood , I ran along to Elfrida Cragg's portrait to get a good view as they left - " 
" Thank you , " said Dumbledore . 
He looked round at Professor McGonagall . 
" Minerva , I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children . " 
" Of course … " 
Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door . 
Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron , who was looking terrified . 
" And Dumbledore - what about Molly ? " said Professor McGonagall , pausing at the door . 
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told , not the time , but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members , and with a pang he thought that Mr . Weasley's hand must , even now , be pointing atmortal peril . 
But it was very late . 
Mrs . Weasley was probably asleep , not watching the clock . 
Harry felt cold as he remembered Mrs . Weasley's Boggart turning into Mr . Weasley's lifeless body , his glasses askew , blood running down his face … but Mr . Weasley wasn't going to die … he couldn't … 
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron . 
He raised his wand and murmured , " Portus ! " 
Dumbledore marched over to another portrait , this time of a clever - looking wizard with a pointed beard , who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore's voice when he attempted to rouse him . 
" Phineas . 
Phineas . " 
The subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep ; they were shifting around in their frames , the better to watch what was happening . 
When the clever - looking wizard continued to feign sleep , some of them shouted his name , too . 
" Phineas ! 
Phineas ! 
PHINEAS ! " 
He could not pretend any longer ; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide . 
" I need you to visit your other portrait again , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . " I ' ve got another message . " 
" Visit my other portrait ? " said Phineas in a reedy voice , giving a long , fake yawn ( his eyes traveling around the room and focusing on Harry ) . 
Something about Phineas's voice was familiar to Harry , where had he heard it before ? 
But before he could think , the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest . 
" We are honor - bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts ! " cried a fraillooking old wizard whom Harry recognized as Dumbledore's predecessor , Armando Dippet . 
" Shame on you , Phineas ! " 
" Shall I persuade him , Dumbledore ? " called a gimlet - eyed witch , raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod . 
" Oh , very well , " said the wizard called Phineas , eyeing the wand with mild apprehension , " though he may well have destroyed my picture by now , he's done away with most of the family - " 
" Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait , " said Dumbledore , and Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas's voice before : issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place . 
" You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife , children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly . 
Do you understand ? " 
" Arthur Weasley , injured , wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay , " repeated Phineas in a bored voice . 
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again . 
Fred , George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall , all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked , still in their night things . 
" Harry - what's going on ? " asked Ginny , who looked frightened . 
" Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt - " 
" Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix , " said Dumbledore , before Harry could speak . 
I am sending you back to Sirius's house , which is much more convenient for the hospital than The Burrow . 
You will meet your mother there . " 
" How ' re we going ? " asked Fred , looking shaken . 
" Floo powder ? " 
" No , " said Dumbledore , " Floo powder is not safe at the moment , the Network is being watched . 
" We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back … I want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you - " 
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office , leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor . 
" It is Fawkes's warning , " said Dumbledore , catching the feather as it fell . 
" He says he ' ll be delighted , " said a bored voice behind Dumbledore ; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner . 
" Come here , then , " Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys . 
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore's desk . 
" You have all used a Portkey before ? " asked Dumbledore , and they nodded , each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle . 
" Good . 
It happened in a fraction of a second : in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said " three " , Harry looked up at him - they were very close together - and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry's face . 
At once , Harry's scar burned white - hot , as though the old wound had burst open again - and unbidden , unwanted , but terrifyingly strong , there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt , for that instant , he would like nothing better than to strike - to bite - to sink his fangs into the man before him — 
Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel , the ground vanished from beneath his feet , his hand was glued to the kettle ; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind , the kettle pulling them onwards … until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled , the kettle clattered to the ground , and somewhere close at hand a voice said : 
Is it true their father's dying ? " 
Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around ; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve , Grimmauld Place . 
The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle , which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper . 
Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall , looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth ; Sirius was hurrying towards them all , looking anxious . 
" What's going on ? " he said , stretching out a hand to help Ginny up . 
" Ask Harry , " said Fred . 
" Yeah , I want to hear this for myself , " said George . 
The twins and Ginny were staring at him . 
Kreacher's footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside . 
" It was - " Harry began ; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore . 
" I had a - a kind of – vision . " 
And he told them all that he had seen , though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked , rather than from behind the snake's own eyes . 
When Harry had finished , Fred , George and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment . 
Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not , but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks . 
Well , if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack , he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time . 
" Is Mum here ? " said Fred , turning to Sirius . 
" She probably doesn't even know what's happened yet , " said Sirius . 
" We ' ve got to go to St . Mungo's , " said Ginny urgently . 
" Sirius , can you lend us cloaks or anything ? " 
" Hang on , you can't go tearing off to St . Mungo's ! " said Sirius . 
" Course we can go to St . Mungo's if we want , " said Fred , with a mulish expression . 
" And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know ? " 
" What does that matter ? " said George hotly . 
" It matters because we don't want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away ! " said Sirius angrily . 
" Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information ? " 
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything . 
Ron was still ashen - faced and silent . 
Ginny said , " Somebody else could have told us … we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry . " 
" Listen , your dad's been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened , you could seriously damage the Order's - " 
" We don't care about the dumb Order ! " shouted Fred . 
" Your father knew what he was getting into and he won't thank you for messing things up for the Order ! " said Sirius , equally angry . 
" This is how it is - this is why you ' re not in the Order - you don't understand - there are things worth dying for ! " 
" Easy for you to say , stuck here ! " 
He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred , but when he spoke , it was in a voice of determined calm . 
" I know it's hard , but we ' ve all got to act as though we don't know anything yet . 
We ' ve got to stay put , at least until we hear from your mother , all right ? " 
Fred and George still looked mutinous . 
Ginny , however , took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it . 
Harry looked at Ron , who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug , and they sat down too . 
" That's right , " said Sirius encouragingly , " come on , let's all … let's all have a drink while we ' re waiting . 
He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry , skidded along the table , scattering the debris of Sinus's meal , and stopped neatly in front of the six of them . 
They all drank , and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table . 
Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands . 
His stomach was full of horrible hot , bubbling guilt . 
They would not be here if it were not for him ; they would all still be asleep in bed . 
And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr . Weasley was found , because there was also the in escapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr . Weasley in the first place . 
Don't be stupid , you haven't got fangs , he told himself , trying to keep calm , though the hand on his Butterbeer bottle was shaking , you were lying in bed , you weren't attacking anyone … 
But then , what just happened in Dumbledore's office ? he asked himself . 
I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore , too … 
He put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to , and it slopped over on to the table . 
No one took any notice . 
Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and , as they gave cries of shock , a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table , accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather . 
" That's not Dumbledore's writing - it must be a message from your mother - here - " 
He thrust the letter into George's hand , who ripped it open and read aloud : " Dad is still alive . 
I 
Stay where you are . 
I will send news as soon as I can . 
George looked around the table . 
" Still alive … " he said slowly . 
" But that makes it sound … " 
He did not need to finish the sentence . 
It sounded to Harry , too , as though Mr . Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death . 
Still exceptionally pale , Ron stared at the back of his mothers letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him . 
Fred pulled the parchment out of George's hands and read it for himself , then looked up at Harry , who felt his hand shaking on his Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling . 
If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one , he could not remember it . 
Sirius suggested once , without any real conviction , that they all go to bed , but the Weasleys ' looks of disgust were answer enough . 
They mostly sat in silence around the table , watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax , occasionally raising a bottle to their lips , speaking only to check the time , to wonder aloud what was happening , and to reassure each other that if there was bad news , they would know straightaway , for Mrs . Weasley must long since have arrived at St . Mungo's . 
Fred fell into a doze , his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder . 
Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair , but her eyes were open ; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight . 
Ron was sitting with his head in his hands , whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell . 
Harry and Sirius looked at each other every so often , intruders upon the family grief , waiting … waiting … 
At ten past five in the morning by Ron's watch , the kitchen door swung open and Mrs . Weasley entered the kitchen . 
She was extremely pale , but when they all turned to look at her , Fred , Ron and Harry half rising from their chairs , she gave a wan smile . 
We can all go and see him later . 
Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face . 
George and Ginny got up , walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her . 
Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his Butterbeer in one . 
" Breakfast ! " said Sirius loudly and joyfully , jumping to his feet . 
Kreacher ! 
KREACHER ! " 
But Kreacher did not answer the summons . 
" Oh , forget it , then , " muttered Sirius , counting the people in front of him . 
" So , it's breakfast for - let's see - seven … bacon and eggs , I think , and some tea , and toast - " 
Harry hurried over to the stove to help . 
He did not want to intrude on the Weasleys ' happiness and he dreaded the moment when Mrs . Weasley would ask him to recount his vision . 
However , he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs . Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug . 
" I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for you , Harry , " she said in a muffled voice . 
" They might not have found Arthur for hours , and then it would have been too late , but thanks to you he's alive and Dumbledore's been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was , you ' ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise , look at poor Sturgis … " 
Harry could hardly bear her gratitude , but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night . 
Sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help , and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr . Weasley was in hospital . 
" Oh , Sirius , I'm so grateful … they think he ' ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer … of course , that might mean we ' re here for Christmas . " 
Er - now ? " 
He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed . 
Without preamble , Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had , including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr . Weasley . 
When he paused for breath , Sirius said , " Did you tell Dumbledore this ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry impatiently , " but he didn't tell me what it meant . 
Well , he doesn't tell me anything any more . " 
" I'm sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about , " said Sirius steadily . 
" But that's not all , " said Harry , in a voice only a little above a whisper . 
" Sirius , I … I think I'm going mad . 
Back in Dumbledore's office , just before we took the Portkey … for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake , I felt like one - my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore - Sirius , I wanted to attack him ! " 
He could only see a sliver of Siriuss face ; the rest was in darkness . 
" It must have been the aftermath of the vision , that's all , " said Sirius . 
" It wasn't that , " said Harry , shaking his head , " it was like something rose up inside me , like there's a snake inside me . " 
" You need to sleep , " said Sirius firmly . 
" You ' re going to have breakfast , then go upstairs to bed , and after lunch you can go and see Arthur with the others . 
You ' re in shock , Harry ; you ' re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed , and it's lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died . 
He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry , leaving Harry standing alone in the dark . 
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping . 
He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer , but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes , Harry sat fully clothed , hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead , keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable , determined not to fall into a doze , terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron , or else slithered through the house after one of the others … 
When Ron woke up , Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too . 
Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch , so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St Mungo's . 
Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts . 
When Tonks and Mad - Eye turned up to escort them across London , they greeted them gleefully , laughing at the bowler hat Mad - Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him , truthfully , that Tonks , whose hair was short and bright pink again , would attract far less attention on the Underground . 
Tonks was very interested in Harry's vision of the attack on Mr . Weasley , something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing . 
" No , " said Harry , thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted . 
" No , " said Tonks musingly , " no , I suppose it's not really prophecy you ' re doing , is it ? 
I mean , you ' re not seeing the future , you ' re seeing the present … it's odd , isn't it ? 
Harry didn't answer ; fortunately , they got out at the next stop , a station in the very heart of London , and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks , who was leading the way . 
They all followed her up the escalator , Moody clunking along at the back of the group , his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat , clutching his wand . 
Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream , he asked Mad - Eye where St . Mungo's was hidden . 
" Not far from here , " grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store - lined street packed with Christmas shoppers . 
He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind ; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat . 
Theory was , sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd . " 
He seized Harry's shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets . 
" Here we go , " said Moody a moment later . 
They had arrived outside a large , old - fashioned , red - brick department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd . 
" Right , " said Tonks , beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy . 
They nodded , clustering around her . Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass , looking up at the very ugly dummy , her breath steaming up the glass . 
Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass , with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers . 
Then he reminded himself that dummies couldn't hear anyway . 
Next second , his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger , and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs . Weasley by the elbows , stepped right through the glass and vanished . 
Fred , George and Ron stepped after them . 
Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd ; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of Purge & Dowse Ltd ; nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them . 
" C ' mon , " growled Moody , giving Harry yet another poke in the back , and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water , emerging quite warm and dry on the other side . 
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood . 
They were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs , some looking perfectly normal and perusing out - of - date copies of WitchWeekly , others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests . 
The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside , for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises : a sweaty - faced witch in the center of the front row , who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet , kept letting off a high - pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth ; a grubby - looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and , with each clang , his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady . 
Witches and wizards in lime - green robes were walking up and down the rows , asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge's . 
Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests : a wand and bone , crossed . 
" Are they doctors ? " he asked Ron quietly . 
" Doctors ? " said Ron , looking startled . 
" Over here ! " 
called Mrs . Weasley above the renewed c langing of the warlock in the corner , and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked Enquiries . 
There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled : 
Dilys Derwent 
St . Mungo's Healer 1722 - 
Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 1741 - 
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party closely as though counting them ; when Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink , walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished . 
Meanwhile , at the front of the queue , a young wizard was performing an odd on - the - spot jig and trying , in between yelps of pain , to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk . 
" The shoes don't prevent you reading , do they ? " said the blonde witch , irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk . 
Just like it says on the floor guide . 
Next ! " 
As the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way , the Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide : 
Bites , stings , burns , embedded spines , etc . 
A very old , stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now . 
" I'm here to see Broderick Bode ! " he wheezed . 
" Ward forty - nine , but I'm afraid you ' re wasting your time , " said the witch dismissively . 
Next ! " 
A harassed - looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large , feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit . 
" Fourth floor , " said the witch , in a bored voice , without asking , and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk , holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon . 
" Next ! " 
Mrs . Weasley moved forward to the desk . 
" Hello , " she said , " my husband , Arthur Weasley , was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning , could you tell us - ? " 
" Arthur Weasley ? " said the witch , running her finger down a long list in front of her . 
" Thank you , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Come on , you lot . " 
They followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond , which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling , looking like giant soapsuds . 
More witches and wizards in lime - green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed ; a foul - smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door , and every now and then they heard distant wailing . 
They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature - Induced Injuries corridor , where the second door on the right bore the words : Dangerous ' Dai Llewellyn Ward : Serious Bites . 
Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten : Healer - in - Charge : Hippocrates Smethwyck . 
Trainee Healer : Augustus Pye . 
Mad - Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall , his magical eye spinning in all directions . 
Harry drew back , too , but Mrs . Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door , saying , " Don't be silly , Harry , Arthur wants to thank you . " 
The ward was small and rather dingy , as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door . 
Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling . 
The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious - looking wizard on the wall , captioned : Urquhart Rackharrow , 1612 — 1697 , Inventor of the Entrailexpelling Curse . 
There were only three patients . 
Mr . Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window . 
Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed . 
He looked up as they walked towards him and , seeing who it was , beamed . 
" Bill just left , Molly , had to get back to work , but he says he ' ll drop in on you later . " 
" How are you , Arthur ? " asked Mrs . Weasley , bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face . 
" Why can't they take them off , Dad ? " asked Fred . 
" Well , I start bleeding like mad every time they try , " said Mr . Weasley cheerfully , reaching across for his wand , which lay on his bedside cabinet , and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all . 
They're sure they ' ll find an antidote , though ; they say they ' ve had much worse cases than mine , and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood - Replenishing Potion every hour . 
But that fellow over there , " he said , dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling . 
" A werewolf ? " 
" It's two weeks till full moon , " Mr . Weasley reminded her quietly . 
" They ' ve been talking to him this morning , the Healers , you know , trying to persuade him he ' ll be able to lead an almost normal life . 
I said to him - didn't mention names , of course - but I said I knew a werewolf personally , very nice man , who finds the condition quite easy to manage . " 
" What did he say ? " asked George . 
" And that woman over there , " he indicated the only other occupied bed , which was right beside the door , " won't tell the Healers what bit her , which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally . 
Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg , very nasty smell when they take off the dressings . " 
" So , you going to tell us what happened , Dad ? " asked Fred , pulling his chair closer to the bed . 
" Well , you already know , don't you ? " said Mr . Weasley , with a significant smile at Harry . 
" It's very simple - I'd had a very long day , dozed off , got sneaked up on and bitten . " 
asked Fred , indicating the newspaper Mr . Weasley had cast aside . 
" No , of course not , " said Mr . Weasley , with a slightly bitter smile , " the Ministry wouldn't want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got — " 
Mrs . Weasley warned him . 
" - got - er - me , " Mr . Weasley said hastily , though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say . 
" That's my business , " said Mr . Weasley , though with a small smile . 
He snatched up the Daily Prophe , shook it open again and said , " I was just reading about Willy Widdershins's arrest when you arrived . 
One of his jinxes backfired , the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in - " 
" When you say you were ' on duty ' , " Fred interrupted in a low voice , " what were you doing ? " 
" You heard your father , " whispered Mrs . Weasley , " we are not discussing this here ! 
Go on about Willy Widdershins , Arthur . " 
" Well , don't ask me how , but he actually got off the toilet charge , " said Mr . Weasley grimly . 
" You were guarding it , weren't you ? " said George quietly . 
" The weapon ? 
" George , be quiet ! " 
snapped Mrs . Weasley . 
" Anyway , " said Mr . Weasley , in a raised voice , " this time Willy's been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I don't think he ' ll be able to worm his way out of it because , according to this article , two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St . Mungo's for emergency bone re - growth and memory modification . 
Just think of it , Muggles in St . Mungo's ! 
And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost . 
You saw it the night he returned , didn't you ? " 
" That's enough , " said Mrs . Weasley crossly . 
" Mad - Eye and Tonks are outside , Arthur , they want to come and see you . 
And you lot can wait outside , " she added to her children and Harry . 
Go on . " 
They trooped back into the corridor . 
Mad - Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them . 
Fred raised his eyebrows . 
" Fine , " he said coolly , rummaging in his pockets , " be like that . 
He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other . 
Fred and George handed them around . 
Harry hesitated to take one . 
" Go on , Harry , take it ! 
If anyone's got the right to eavesdrop on him , it's you . " 
Grinning in spite of himself , Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done . 
" Okay , go ! " Fred whispered . 
At first , Harry could hear nothing , then he jumped as he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him . 
" … they searched the whole area but couldn't find the snake anywhere . 
" I reckon he sent it as a lookout , " growled Moody , " cause he's not had any luck so far , has he ? 
No , I reckon he's trying to get a clearer picture of what he's facing and if Arthur hadn't been there the beast would ' ve had a lot more time to look around . 
So , Potter says he saw it all happen ? " 
" Yes , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" You know , Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this . " 
" Yeah , well , " said Moody , " there's something funny about the Potter kid , we all know that . " 
" Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning , " whispered Mrs Weasley . 
Obviously , Potter doesn't realize what that means , but if You - Know - Who's possessing him — " 
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own , his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face . 
He looked around at the others . 
Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry's eyes ? 
Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own , wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull . 
He felt dirty , contaminated , as though he were carrying some deadly germ , unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent , clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort … he had not merely seen the snake , he hadbeen the snake , he knew it now … 
I'm the weapon , Harry thought , and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins , chilling him , bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel . 
I'm the one Voldemorts trying to use , that's why they ' ve got guards around me everywhere I go , it's not for my protection , it's for other people's , only it's not working , they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts … I did attack Mr . Weasley last night , it was me . 
Are you feeling sick ? " 
They were all watching him . 
He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance . 
" Harry , dear , are you sure you ' re all right ? " said Mrs . Weasley in a worried voice , as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place . 
" You look ever so pale … are you sure you slept this morning ? 
He nodded ; here was a ready - made excuse not to talk to any of the others , which was precisely what he wanted , so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the troll's - leg umbrella stand , up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom . 
Here , he began to pace up and down , past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty picture frame , his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas . 
How had he become a snake ? 
Perhaps he was an Animagus … no , he couldn't be , he would know … perhapsVoldemort was an Animagus … yes , thought Harry , that would fit , he would turn into a snake of course … and when he's possessing me , then we both transform … that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes … but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world , apart from Dumbledore , it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that . 
And then , with a terrible stab of panic , he thought , but this is insane - if Voldemort's possessing me , I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarter s of the Order of the Phoenix right now ! He ' ll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is … and I ' ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have , everything Sirius told me the first night I was here … 
There was only one thing for it : he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway . 
He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others , which would keep them safe over the holidays at least … but no , that wouldn't do , there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure . 
What if it was Seamus , Dean or Neville next time ? 
He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame . 
A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach . 
He had no alternative : he was going to have to return to Privet Drive , cut himself off from other wizards entirely . 
Well , if he had to do it , he thought , there was no point hanging around . 
Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected , he strode over to his trunk , slammed the lid shut and locked it , then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well , her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said , " Running away , are we ? " 
He looked around . 
Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame , watching Harry with an amused expression on his face . 
" Not running away , no , " said Harry shortly , dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room . 
" I thought , " said Phineas Nigellus , stroking his pointed beard , " that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave ! 
We Slytherins are brave , yes , but not stupid . 
For instance , given the choice , we will always choose to save our own necks . " 
" It's not my own neck I'm saving , " said Harry tersely , tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven , moth - eaten carpet right in front of the door . 
" Oh , I see , " said Phineas Nigellus , still stroking his beard , " this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble . " 
Harry ignored him . 
His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily , " I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore . " 
Harry span round . 
" What is it ? " 
" ' Stay where you are . ' " 
" I haven't moved ! " said Harry , his hand still upon the doorknob . 
" So what's the message ? " 
" I have just given it to you , dolt , " said Phineas Ni gellus smoothly . 
" Dumbledore says , ' Stay where you are . ' " 
" Why does he want me to stay ? 
What else did he say ? " 
Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass . 
He was exhausted , he was confused beyond measure , he had experienced terror , relief , then terror again in the last twelve hours , and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him ! 
" So that's it , is it ? " 
he said loudly . 
That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors , too ! 
We won't bother telling you anything , though , because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it ! " 
" You know , " said Phineas Nigellus , even more loudly than Harry " this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher ! 
Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything . 
Has it not occurred to you , my poor puffed - up popinjay , that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you ? Have you never paused , while feeling hard - done - by , to note that following Dumbledores orders has never yet led you into harm ? 
" He is planning something to do with me , then ? " said Harry swiftly . 
" Now , if you will excuse me , I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising … good - day to you . " 
And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight . 
Harry bellowed at the empty frame . 
Fuming , Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed , then threw himself face down on the moth - eaten covers , his eyes shut , his body heavy and aching . 
He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles … it seemed impossible that less than twenty - four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe … he was so tired … he was scared to sleep … yet he did not know how long he could fight it … Dumbledore had told him to stay … that must mean he was allowed to sleep … but he was scared … what if it happened again ? 
He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door , past rough stone walls , torches , and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left … 
He reached the black door but could not open it … he stood gazing at it , desperate for entry … something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond … a prize beyond his dreams … if only his scar would stop prickling … then he would be able to think more clearly … 
" Harry , " said Ron's voice , from far , far away , " Mum says dinner's ready , but she ' ll save you something if you want to stay in bed . " 
Harry opened his eyes , but Ron had already left the room . 
He doesn't want to be on his own with me , Harry thought . 
Not after what he heard Moody say . 
He turned over on to his other side and , after a while , dropped back off to sleep . 
He woke much later , in the early hours of the morning , his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed . 
Squinting around the room , he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him , in case he attacked somebody else . 
He half - wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore … if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on , maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all . 
Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone , watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows , threatening snow , all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him , as they were bound to be doing . 
When he heard Mrs . Weasley calling his name softly u p the stairs around lunchtime , he retreated further upstairs and ignored her . 
Around six o ' clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs . Black started screaming again . 
Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call , Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding , trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff . 
" I know you ' re in there , " said Hermione's voice . 
I want to talk to you . " 
" What are you doing here ? " 
Harry asked her , pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw - strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped . 
There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold . 
I told him it's really good because he kept laughing so much . 
Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed , but I ' ve told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study . 
They want me to do well , they ' ll understand . 
Anyway , " she said briskly , " let's go to your bedroom , Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches . " 
Harry followed her back to the second floor . 
When he entered the bedroom , he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them , sitting on Ron's bed . 
" I came on the Knight Bus , " said Hermione airily , pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak . 
" Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning , but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off . 
Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose , even though Dumbledore told her Mr . Weasley was in St . Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit . 
So … " She sat down next to Ginny , and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry . 
" How ' re you feeling ? " asked Hermione . 
" Fine , " said Harry stiffly . 
" Oh , don't lie , Harry , " she said impatiently . 
" They do , do they ? " said Harry , glaring at Ron and Ginny . 
Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed . 
" Well , you have ! " she said . 
" It's you lot who won't look at me ! " said Harry ang rily . 
" Very funny , " snapped Harry , turning away . 
" Look , the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - " " Yeah ? " growled Harry , his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside . 
Well , I'm getting used to it . " 
" We wanted to talk to you , Harry , " said Ginny , " but as you ' ve been hiding ever since we got back - " 
" I didn't want anyone to talk to me , " said Harry , w ho was feeling more and more nettled . 
" Well , that was a bit stupid of you , " said Ginny angrily , " seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You - Know - Who , and I can tell you how it feels . " 
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him . 
Then he wheeled round . 
" I forgot , " he said . 
" I'm sorry " Harry said , and he meant it . 
" So … so , do you think I'm being possessed , then ? " 
" Well , can you remember everything you ' ve been doing ? " 
Harry racked his brains . 
" No , " he said . 
" When he did it to me , I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time . 
I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there . " 
Harry hardly dared believe her , yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself . 
" That dream I had about your dad and the snake , though — " 
" Harry you ' ve had these dreams before , " Hermione said . 
" This was different , " said Harry , shaking his head . 
It was like I was the snake … what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ? " 
Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory , Harry . " 
" You didn't leave your bed , mate , " said Ron . " I saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up . " 
Harry started pacing up and down the room again , thinking . 
What they were all saying was not only comforting , it made sense … without really thinking , he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth . 
I'm not the weapon after all , thought Harry . 
His heart swelled with happiness and relief , and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeak's room , singing " God Rest Ye , Merry Hippogriffs " at the top of his voice . 
How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas ? 
He was no longer their sullen host of the summer ; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much , if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts , and he worked tirelessly in the run - up to Christmas Day , cleaning and decorating with their help , so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable . 
The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers ; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets ; a great Christmas tree , obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies , blocked Sirius's family tree from view , and even the stuffed elf - heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards . 
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own , rather larger , pile . 
Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermiones handwriting on it . 
She had given him , too , a book that resembled a diary except that it said things like " Do it today or later you ' ll pay ! " every time he opend a page . 
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts , which had superb , moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described . 
Tonks's present was a small , working model of a Firebolt , which Harry watched fly around the room , wishing he still had his full - size version ; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every - Flavour Beans , Mr . and Mrs . Weasley the usual hand - knitted jumper and some mince pies , and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself . 
He had just turned it upsidedown to see whether it looked better that way when , with a loudcrack , Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed . 
" Merry Christmas , " said George . 
" Why not ? " said Ron . 
" Mum's crying again , " said Fred heavily . 
" Percy sent back his Christmas jumper . " 
" We tried to comfort her , " said Fred , moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait . 
" So Lupin took over . 
Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast , I reckon . " 
" It's Harry ! " said George , pointing at the back of the picture , " says so on the back ! " 
Harry threw his new homework diary at him ; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily : " If you ' ve dotted the ' i's and crossed the ' t's then you may do whatever you please ! " 
They got up and dressed . 
They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling " Merry Christmas " to one another . 
On their way downstairs they met Hermione . 
" Thanks for the book , Harry " she said happily . 
And that perfume's really unusual , Ron . " 
" No problem , " said Ron . " Who's that for , anyway ? " he added , nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying . 
" Kreacher , " said Hermione brightly . 
" You know what Sirius said : Kreacher knows too much , we can't set him free ! " 
" It isn't clothes , " said Hermione , " although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag . 
" What bedroom ? " said Harry , dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother . 
" Well , Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom , more a kind of - den , " said Hermione . 
" Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen . " 
Mrs . Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there . 
She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them " Merry Christmas , " and they all averted their eyes . 
" So , is this Kreacher's bedroom ? " said Ron , strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry . 
Harry had never seen it open . 
" Yes , " said Hermione , now sounding a little nervous . 
" Er … I think we'd better knock . " 
Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply . 
" He must be sneaking around upstairs , " he said , and without further ado pulled open the door . 
Harry peered inside . 
Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old - fashioned boiler , but in the foot's space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest . 
A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night . 
In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved , magpie - like , from Sirius's purge of the house , and he had also managed to retrieve the silver - framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer . 
Their glass might be shattered , but still the little black - and - white people inside them peered up at him haughtily , including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark , heavy - lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve : Bellatrix Lestrange . 
By the looks of it , hers was Kreacher's favorite photograph ; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape . 
" I think I ' ll just leave his present here , " said Hermione , laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly . 
" Come to think of it , " said Sirius , emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door , " has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately ? " 
" I haven't seen him since the night we came back here , " said Harry . 
" You know , I think that's the last time I saw him , too … he must be hiding upstairs somewhere . " 
" He couldn't have left , could he ? " said Harry . 
" I mean , when you said ' out ' , maybe he thought you meant get out of the house ? " 
" No , no , house - elves can't leave unless they ' re given clothes . 
They're tied to their family's house , " said Sirius . 
" They can leave the house if they really want to , " Harry contradicted him . 
He had to punish himself afterwards , but he still managed it . " 
Fred , George and Ron laughed ; Hermione , however , looked reproachful . 
Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch , the Weasleys , Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr . Weasley another visit , escorted by Mad - Eye and Lupin . 
Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle , having managed to ' borrow ' a car for the occasion , as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day . 
Mrs . Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of traveling without magic - but , finally , the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed , and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace . 
A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital . 
Harry and the others got out of the car , and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them . 
They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood , then , one by one , stepped through the glass . 
The reception area looked pleasantly festive : the crystal orbs that illuminated St . Mungo's had been colored red and gold to become gigantic , glowing Christmas baubles ; holly hung around every doorway ; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner , each one topped with a gleaming gold star . 
It was less crowded than the last time they had been there , although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril . 
" Family argument , eh ? " smirked the blonde witch behind the desk . 
They found Mr . Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face . 
" Everything all right , Arthur ? " asked Mrs . Weasley , after they had all greeted Mr . Weasley and handed over their presents . 
" Fine , fine , " said Mr . Weasley , a little too heartily . 
" No , " said Mrs . Weasley suspiciously , " why ? " 
" Nothing , nothing , " said Mr . Weasley airily , starting to unwrap his pile of gifts . 
Oh , Harry - this is absolutely wonderful ! " 
Mrs . Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr . Weasley's answer . 
As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand , she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt . 
" Arthur , " she said , with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap , " you ' ve had your bandages changed . 
They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow . " 
" What ? " said Mr . Weasley , looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest . 
" No , no - it's nothing - it's - I - " 
He seemed to deflate under Mrs . Weasley's piercing gaze . 
" Well - now don't get upset , Molly , but Augustus Pye had an idea … he's the Trainee Healer , you know , lovely young chap and very interested in … um … complementary medicine … I mean , some of these old Muggle remedies … well , they ' re called stitches , Molly , and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds - " 
Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf , who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr . Weasley ; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him , grinning . 
" Do you mean to tell me , " said Mrs . Weasley , her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover , " that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies ? " 
" Not messing about , Molly , dear , " said Mr . Weasley imploringly , " it was just - just something Pye and I thought we'd try - only , most unfortunately — well , with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped - " 
" Well … well , I don't know whether you know what - what stitches are ? " 
" It sounds as though you ' ve been trying to sew your skin back together , " said Mrs . Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter , " but even you , Arthur , wouldn't be that stupid — " 
" I fancy a cup of tea , too , " said Harry , jumping to his feet . 
Hermione , Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him . 
" Typical Dad , " said Ginny , shaking her head as they set off up the corridor . 
" Stitches … I ask you … " 
" I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something . 
I wonder where the tearoom is ? " 
" Fifth floor , " said Harry , remembering the sign over the welcome witch's desk . 
They walked along the corridor , through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal - looking Healers . 
Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit . 
" And what's that supposed to be ? " he asked angrily , as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits , shoving the occupants out of the way . 
" - the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad , bind it tight about your throat , stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels ' eyes - " 
" I have not got spattergroit ! " 
" They're freckles ! " said Ron furiously . 
" Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone ! " 
" What floor's this ? " 
" I think it's the fifth , " said Hermione . 
" Nah , it's the fourth , " said Harry , " one more — " 
But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt , staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE . 
A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass . 
He had wavy blond hair , bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth . 
" Blimey ! " said Ron , also staring at the man . 
" Oh , my goodness , " said Hermione suddenly , sounding breathless . 
" Professor Lockhart ! " 
" Well , hello there ! " he said . 
" I expect you'd like my autograph , would you ? " 
" Er — how are you , Professor ? " said Ron , sounding slightly guilty . 
It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St . Mungo's in the first place , though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time , Harrys sympathy was limited . 
" I'm very well indeed , thank you ! " said Lockhart exuberantly , pulling a rather battered peacockfeather quill from his pocket . 
I can do joined - up writing now , you know ! " 
" Er - we don't want any at the moment , thanks , " said Ron , raising his eyebrows at Harry , who asked , " Professor , should you be wandering around the corridors ? 
The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face . 
For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry , then he said , " Haven't we met ? " 
" Er … yeah , we have , " said Harry . 
" You used to teach us at Hogwarts , remember ? " 
" Teach ? " repeated Lockhart , looking faintly unsettled . 
" Me ? 
Did I ? " 
" Taught you everything you know , I expect , did I ? Well , how about those autographs , then ? 
Shall we say a round dozen , you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out ! " 
But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called , 
" Gilderoy , you naughty boy , where have you wandered off to ? " 
A motherly - looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor , smiling warmly at Harry and the others . 
Do you know , he never gets visitors , poor lamb , and I can't think why , he's such a sweetie , aren't you ? " 
I just hope we ' ve got enough photographs ! " 
" He was rather well known a few years ago ; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back . 
He's in a closed ward , you know , he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents , the door's usually kept locked … not that he's dangerous ! 
But , " she lowered her voice to a whisper , " he's a bit of a danger to himself , bless him … doesn't know who he is , you see , wanders off and can't remember how to get back … it is nice of you to have come to see him . " 
But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them , and Ron's feeble mutter of " going to have a cup of tea " trailed away into nothingness . 
They looked at each other helplessly , then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor . 
" Let's not stay long , " Ron said quietly . 
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered , " Alohomora . " 
The door swung open and she led the way inside , keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoys arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed . 
" This is our long - term residents ' ward , " she informed Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny in a low voice . 
" For permanent spell damage , you know . 
Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself ; and we ' ve seen a real improvement in Mr . Bode , he seems to be regaining th e power of speech very well , though he isn't speaking any language we recognize yet . 
Well , I must finish giving out the Christmas presents , I ' ll leave you all to chat . " 
Harry looked around . 
They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr . Weasley's ward ; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard , for instance , was papered with pictures of himself , all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals . 
The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer , Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him , seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly . 
" You can put them in envelopes , " he said to Ginny , throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them . 
" I am not forgotten , you know , no , I still receive a very great deal of fan mail … Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly … I just wish I knew why . " 
A sallow - skinned , mournful - looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling ; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him . 
Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur ; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year , although fortunately the damage , in her case , had not been permanent . 
At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy . 
" Here you are , Agnes , " said the Healer brightly to the furry - faced woman , handing her a small pile of Christmas presents . 
" See , not forgotten , are you ? 
And your son's sent an owl to say he's visiting tonight , so that's nice , isn't it ? " 
" And look , Broderick , you ' ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month ; they ' ll brighten things up , won't they ? " said the Healer , bustling along to the mumbling man , setting a rather ugly plant with long , swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand . 
The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds : a formidable - looking old witch wearing a long green dress , a moth - eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and , trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed - Neville . 
With a sudden rush of understanding , Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be . 
He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned , but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name " Longbottom " , and before Harry could stop him had called out , " Neville ! " 
" Have you seen - ? Lockhart's here ! 
Who ' ve you been visiting ? " 
Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here . 
" Ah , yes , " said his grandmother , looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled , clawlike hand for him to shake . 
" Yes , yes , I know who you are , of course . 
" Er - thanks , " said Harry , shaking hands . 
Neville did not look at him , but surveyed his own feet , the color deepening in his face all the while . 
" And you two are clearly Weasleys , " Mrs . Longbottom continued , proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn . 
Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs . Longbottom knew her name , but shook hands all the same . 
" Yes , Neville's told me all about you . 
And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward , so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly . 
" What ? " said Ron , looking amazed . 
( Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot , but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you ' re wearing jeans rather than robes . ) 
" What's this ? " said Mrs . Longbottom sharply . 
" Haven't you told your friends about your parents , Neville ? " 
Neville took a deep breath , looked up at the ceiling and shook his head . 
Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone , but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation . 
" Well , it's nothing to be ashamed of ! " said Mrs . Longbottom angrily . 
" You should be proud , Neville , proud ! 
They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them , you know ! " 
" I'm not ashamed , " said Neville , very faintly , still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others . 
Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds . 
" My son and his wife , " she said , turning haughtily to Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny , " were tortured into insanity by You - Know - Who's followers . " 
Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths . 
Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified . 
" They were Aurors , you know , and very well respected within the wizarding community " Mrs . Longbottom went on . 
" Highly gifted , the pair of them . 
Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress . 
She no longer had the plump , happy - looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix . 
Her face was thin and worn now , her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair , which had turned white , was wispy and dead - looking . 
She did not seem to want to speak , or perhaps she was not able to , but she made timid motions towards Neville , holding something in her outstretched hand . 
" Very well , Alice dear , very well - Neville , take it , whatever it is . " 
But Neville had already stretched out his hand , into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper . 
" Very nice , dear , " said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice , patting his mother on the shoulder . 
But Neville said quietly , " Thanks , Mum . " 
His mother tottered away , back up the ward , humming to herself . 
Neville looked around at the others , his expression defiant , as though daring them to laugh , but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life . 
" Very nice to have met you all . 
But as they left , Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the candy wrapper into his pocket . 
The door closed behind them . 
" I never knew , " said Hermione , who looked tearful . 
" Nor me , " whispered Ginny . 
They all looked at Harry . 
" I did , " he said glumly . 
" Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone … that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for , using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds . " 
" That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den ? " 
There was a long silence , broken by Lockharts angry voice . 
Kreacher , it transpired , had been lurking in the attic . 
Sirius said he had found him up there , covered in dust , no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard . 
Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story , it made Harry uneasy . 
Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance , his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual , though once or twice Harry caught the house - elf staring at him avidly , but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that Harry had noticed . 
Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius , whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over . 
As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer , he became more and more prone to what Mrs . Weasley call ed ' fits of the sullens ' , in which he would become taciturn and grumpy , often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time . 
His gloom seeped through the house , oozing under doorways like some noxious gas , so that all of them became infected by it . 
Harry didn't want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company ; in fact , for the first time in his life , he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts . 
Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge , who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence ; there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned ; there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer ; and Dumbledore remained as remote as ever . 
In fact , if it hadn't been for the D . A . , Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place . 
Then , on the very last day of the holidays , something happened that made Harry positively dread his return to school . 
" Harry , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley , poking her head in to his and Ron's bedroom , where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione , Ginny and Crookshanks , " could you come down to the kitchen ? 
Harry did not immediately register what she had said ; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Rons and he was egging it on enthusiastically . 
Sorry , Mrs . Weasley , what did you say ? " 
" Professor Snape , dear . 
In the kitchen . 
Harry's mouth fell open in horror . 
He looked around at Ron , Hermione and Ginny , all of whom were gaping back at him . 
Crookshanks , whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour , leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover , squealing at the top of their voices . 
" Snape ? " said Harry blankly . 
" Professor Snape , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley reprovingly . 
" Now come on , quickly , he says he can't stay long . " 
" You haven't done anything , have you ? " 
" No ! " said Harry indignantly , racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place . 
A minute or two later , he pushed open the kitchen door to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table , glaring in opposite directions . 
The silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike . 
A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius . 
" Er , " said Harry , to announce his presence . 
Snape looked around at him , his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair . 
" Sit down , Potter . " 
" You know , " said Sirius loudly , leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling , " I think I'd prefer it if you didn't give orders here , Snape . 
It's my house , you see . " 
Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius , facing Snape across the table . 
" I'm his godfather , " said Sirius , louder than ever . 
" Merely that I am sure you must feel - ah - frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful , " Snape laid a delicate stress on the word , " for the Order . " 
It was Sirius's turn to flush . 
Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry . 
" The Headmaster has sent me to tell you , Potter , that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term . " 
" Study what ? " said Harry blankly . 
Snape's sneer became more pronounced . 
" Occlumency , Potter . 
The magical Defense of the mind against external penetration . 
Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed . 
" Why do I have to study Occlu — thing ? " he blurted out . 
" Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea , " said Snape smoothly . 
" You will receive private lessons once a week , but you will not tell anybody what you are doing , least of all Dolores Umbridge . 
You understand ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
Snape raised an eyebrow . 
" I am , " he said . 
He looked quickly round at Sirius for support . 
" Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry ? " asked Sirius aggressively . 
" Why you ? " 
" I assure you I did not beg for the job . " 
He got to his feet . 
Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them . " 
" Wait a moment , " said Sirius , sitting up straighter in his chair . 
Snape turned back to face them , sneering . 
" I am in rather a hurry , Black . 
Unlike you , I do not have unlimited leisure time . " 
He was rather taller than Snape who , Harry noticed , balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand . 
" If I hear you ' re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time , you ' ll have me to answer to . " 
" How touching , " Snape sneered . 
" But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father ? " 
" Yes , I have , " said Sirius proudly . 
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape , pulling out his wand as he went . 
They were squaring up to each other , Sirius looking livid , Snape calculating , his eyes darting from Sirius's wand - tip to his face . 
" Sirius ! " said Harry loudly , but Sirius appeared not to hear him . 
" Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother's house for six months ? " 
" Tell me , how is Lucius Malfoy these days ? 
I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts , isn't he ? " 
" Speaking of dogs , " said Snape softly , " did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside ? 
Sirius raised his wand . 
" NO ! " Harry yelled , vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them . 
roared Sirius , trying to push Harry out of the way , but Harry would not budge . 
" Why , yes , I suppose I am , " said Snape . 
" Harry - get - out - of - it ! " 
The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family , plus Hermione , came inside , all looking very happy , with Mr . Weasley walking proudly in thei r midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamass covered by a mackintosh . 
He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold , gazing at the scene in front of them , which was also suspended in mid - action , both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between them , a hand stretched out to each , trying to force them apart . 
" Merlin's beard , " said Mr . Weasley , the smile slidin g off his face , " what's going on here ? " 
Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands . 
Harry looked from one to the other . 
Each wore an expression of utmost contempt , yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses . 
Snape pocketed his wand , turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen , passing the Weasleys without comment . 
At the door he looked back . 
And he was gone . 
Sirius glared after him , his wand at his side . 
" What's been going on ? " asked Mr . Weasley again . 
" Nothing , Arthur , " said Sirius , who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance . 
" So … you ' re cured ? 
That's great news , really great . " 
" Yes , isn't it ? " said Mrs . Weasley , leading her husb and forward to a chair . 
" Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end , found an antidote to whatever that snake's got in its fangs , and Arthur's learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine , haven't you , dear ? " she added , rather menacingly . 
" Yes , Molly , dear , " said Mr . Weasley meekly . 
That night's meal should have been a cheerful one , with Mr . Weasley back amongst them . 
Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so , yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food , his face fell back into a moody , brooding expression . 
Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad - Eye , who had dropped in to offer Mr . Weasley their congratulations . 
He wanted to talk to Sirius , to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said , that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place . 
But he had no opportunity to do so , and , eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face , Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance . 
Instead , he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape . 
" Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort , " said Hermione at once . 
" Well , you won't be sorry not to have them any more , will you ? " 
" Extra lessons with Snape ? " said Ron , sounding aghast . 
They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day , escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin , both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry , Ron and Hermione came down next morning . 
The adults seemed to have been mid - way through a whispered conversation as Harry opened the door ; all of them looked round hastily and fell silent . 
After a hurried breakfast , they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey January morning . 
Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest ; he did not want to say goodbye to Sirius . 
He had a bad feeling about this parting ; he didn't know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid - Harry was worried that Snape's accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place . 
Before he could think of what to say , however , Sirius had beckoned him to his side . 
" I want you to take this , " he said quietly , thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry's hands . 
" What is it ? " 
Harry asked . 
" I doubt Molly would approve - but I want you to use it if you need me , all right ? " 
" Okay , " said Harry , stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket , but he knew he would never use whatever it was . 
" Let's go , then , " said Sirius , clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly , and before Harry could say anything else , they were heading upstairs , stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door , surrounded by Weasleys . 
" Goodbye , Harry , take care , " said Mrs . Weasley , hugg ing him . 
" See you , Harry , and keep an eye out for snakes for me ! " said Mr . Weasley genially , shaking his hand . 
" Right - yeah , " said Harry distractedly ; it was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful ; he turned , looked into his godfather's face : and opened his mouth to speak , but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief , one - armed hug , and saying gruffly , " Look after yourself , Harry . " 
Next moment , Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air , with Tonks ( today heavily disguised as a tall , tweedy woman with iron - grey hair ) chivvying him down the steps . 
The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them . 
They followed Lupin down the front steps . 
" Come on , the quicker we get on the bus the better , " said Tonks , and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square . 
Lupin flung out his right arm . 
BANG . 
A violently purple , triple - decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them , narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost , which jumped backwards out of its way . 
A thin , pimply , jug - eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said , " Welcome to the - " 
" On , on , get on - " 
And she shoved Harry forwards towards the steps , past the conductor , who goggled at Harry as he passed . 
Ginny and Hermione forwards . 
" I ' ve always wanted to go on this thing , " said Ron happily , joining Harry on board and looking around . 
Now , in the early morning , it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows . 
Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place ; a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet , grumbling , and somebody's shopping bag had slid the length of the bus : an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn , cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor . 
" Fred , George and Ginny , if you just take those seats at the back … Remus can stay with you . " 
She , Harry , Ron and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck , where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back . 
Stan Shunpike , the conductor , followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back . 
Heads turned as Harry passed and , when he sat down , he saw all the faces flick back to the front again . 
As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each , the bus set off again , swaying ominously . 
It rumbled around Grimmauld Place , weaving on and off the pavement , then , with another tremendous BANG , they were all flung backwards ; Ron's chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon , who had been on his lap , burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to Hermione's shoulder instead . 
Harry , who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket , looked out of the window : they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway . 
" Just outside Birmingham , " said Stan happily , answe ring Harry's unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor . 
I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer , but it weren't never nuffink very nice . 
I said to Ern , I said , ' e didn't seem like a nutter when we met ' im , just goes to show , dunnit ? " 
He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze , enthralled , at Harry . 
Apparently , Stan did not care how nutty somebody was , if they were famous enough to be in the paper . 
Looking towards the front of the bus , Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands , Pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder . 
BANG . 
Chairs slid backwards again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends . 
Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges . 
From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town , then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills , then to a windswept road between high - rise flats , each time with a loud BANG . 
" I ' ve changed my mind , " muttered Ron , picking himse lf up from the floor for the sixth time , " I never want to ride on this thing again . " 
A few minutes later , the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub , which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision . 
They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck . 
BANG . 
They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade . 
Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog's Head down its side street , the severed boar's head sign creaking in the wintry wind . 
Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus . 
At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts . 
Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them , noses flat against the windows . 
" You ' ll be safe once you ' re in the grounds , " said Tonks , casting a careful eye around at the deserted road . 
" And listen … " he lowered his voice while the rest of the m exchanged last - minute goodbyes with Tonks , " Harry , I know you don't like Snape , but he is a superb Occlumens and we all - Sirius included - want you to learn to protect yourself , so work hard , all right ? " 
" See you , then . " 
The six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle , dragging their trunks . 
Harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors ; the Knight Bus had already gone and he half - wished , given what was coming the following evening , that he was still on board . 
Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening . 
" I ' ll let you know in the usual way when the next one is , " Harry said over and over again , " but I can't do it tonight , I ' ve got to go to - er - remedial Potions . " 
I can still get him from here , " he said , raising his wand and taking aim between Smith's shoulder blades . 
" Forget it , " said Harry dismally . 
" It's what everyone's going to think , isn't it ? 
That I'm really stup — " " Hi , Harry , " said a voice behind him . 
He turned round and found Cho standing there . 
" Oh , " said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably . 
" Hi . " 
" We ' ll be in the library , Harry , " said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase . 
" Yeah , not bad , " said Harry . 
" Mine was pretty quiet , " said Cho . 
For some reason , she was looking rather embarrassed . 
" What ? 
" Yes , it's on Valentine's Day … " 
" Right , " said Harry , wondering why she was telling him this . 
" Well , I suppose you want to - ? " 
" Only if you do , " she said eagerly . 
Harry stared . 
He had been about to say , " I suppose you want to know when the next D . A . meetingis ? " 
but her response did not seem to fit . 
" I - er — " he said . 
" Oh , it's okay if you don't , " she said , looking mortified . 
I - I ' ll see you around . " 
She walked away . 
He ran after her , catching her halfway up the marble staircase . 
" Er - d ' you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine's Day ? " 
" Oooh , yes ! " she said , blushing crimson and beaming at him . 
" Right … well … that's settled then , " said Harry , and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all , he headed off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons , walking in a rather bouncy way himself . 
He paused outside the door when he reached it , wishing he were almost anywhere else , then , taking a deep breath , he knocked and entered . 
The shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously colored potions . 
In one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry - not without reason - of robbing . 
Harry's attention was drawn towards the desk , however , where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight . 
Harry recognized it at once - it was 
Dumbledore's Pensieve . 
Wondering what on earth it was doing there , he jumped when Snape's cold voice came out of the shadows . 
" Shut the door behind you , Potter . " 
Harry did as he was told , with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself . 
When he turned back into the room , Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk . 
Harry sat down and so did Snape , his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry , dislike etched in every line of his face . 
" Well , Potter , you know why you are here , " he said . 
" The Headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency . 
I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at Potions . " 
" Right , " said Harry tersely . 
" This may not be an ordinary class , Potter , " said Snape , his eyes narrowed malevolently , " but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me'sir ' or ' professor ' at all times . " 
" Yes … sir , " said Harry . 
Snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment , then said , " Now , Occlumency . 
As I told you back in your dear godfather's kitchen , this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence . " 
" And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it , sir ? " said Harry , looking directly into Snape's eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer . 
Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously , " Surely even you could have worked that out by now , Potter ? 
The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency - " 
" What's that ? 
Sir ? " 
" It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another persons mind - " 
" You do not understand fine distinctions . 
It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion - maker . " 
Snape paused for a moment , apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting Harry , before continuing . 
The mind is not a book , to be opened at will and examined at leisure . 
" It is true , however , that those who have mastered Legilimency are able , under certain conditions , to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly . 
The Dark Lord , for instance , almost always knows when somebody is lying to him . 
Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie , and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection . " 
Whatever Snape said , Legilimency sounded like mind - reading to Harry , and he didn't like the sound of it at all . 
" So he could know what we ' re thinking right now ? Sir ? " 
" The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them , " said Snape . 
" Time and space matter in magic , Potter . 
Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency . " 
" Well then , why do I have to learn Occlumency ? " 
" The usual rules do not seem to apply with you , Potter . 
The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord . 
The Headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue . 
He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord . " 
Harry's heart was pumping fast again . 
" But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it ? " he asked abruptly . 
" I don't like it much , but it's been useful , hasn't it ? 
I mean … I saw that snake attack Mr . Weasley and if I hadn't , Professor Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to save him , would he ? Sir ? " 
Snape stared at Harry for a few moments , still tracing his mouth with his finger . 
When he spoke again , it was slowly and deliberately , as though he weighed every word . 
" It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently . 
" The one with the snake and Mr . Weasley ? " 
" Do not interrupt me , Potter , " said Snape in a dangerous voice . 
" As I was saying , the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord's thoughts - " 
" I saw inside the snake's head , not his ! " 
" I thought I just told you not to interrupt me , Potter ? " 
But Harry did not care if Snape was angry ; at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business ; he had moved forwards in his chair so that , without realizing it , he was perched on the very edge , tense as though poised for flight . 
" How come I saw through the snakes eyes if it's Voldemort's thoughts I'm sharing ? " 
" Do not say the Dark Lord's name ! " spat Snape . 
There was a nasty silence . 
They glared at each other across the Pensieve . 
" Professor Dumbledore says his name , " said Harry quietly . 
" While he may feel secure enough to use the name … the rest of us … " He rubbed his left forearm , apparently unconsciously , on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin . 
" I just wanted to know , " Harry began again , forcing his voice back to politeness , " why - " 
" You seem to have visited the snake's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment , " snarled Snape . 
" He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it , too . " 
" And Vol — he - realized I was there ? " 
" It seems so , " said Snape coolly . 
" How do you know ? " said Harry urgently . 
" I told you , " said Snape , rigid in his chair , his eyes slits , " to call me'sir ' . " 
" Yes , sir , " said Harry impatiently , " but how do you know - ? " 
" It is enough that we know , " said Snape repressively . 
" The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings . 
He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse ; that is to say , he has realized that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return - " 
" And he might try and make me do things ? " 
asked Harry . 
" Sir ? " he added hurriedly . 
Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and Harry tensed in his chair , but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair . 
Twice more , Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin , then , without offering any explanation of his behavior , he picked up the Pensieve carefully , removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready . 
" Stand up and take out your wand , Potter . " 
They faced each other with the desk between them . 
" You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me , or defend yourself in any other way you can think of , " said Snape . 
" And what are you going to do ? " Harry asked , eyeing Snape's wand apprehensively . 
" I am about to attempt to break into your mind , " said Snape softly . 
Legilimens ! " 
Snape had struck before Harry was ready , before he had even begun to summon any force of resistance . 
The office swam in front of his eyes and vanished ; image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings . 
He was five , watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle , and his heart was bursting with jealousy … he was nine , and Ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing below on the lawn … he was sitting under the Sorting Hat , and it was telling him he would do well in Slytherin … Hermione was lying in the hospital wing , her face covered with thick black hair … a hundred Dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake … Cho Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe … 
" No , " said a voice inside Harry's head , as the memory of Cho drew nearer , " you ' re not watching that , you ' re not watching it , it's private – " 
He felt a sharp pain in his knee . 
Snape's office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor ; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape's desk . 
He looked up at Snape , who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist . 
" No , " said Harry bitterly , getting up from the floor . 
You lost control . " 
" Did you see everything I saw ? " 
" My Aunt Marge , " Harry muttered , hating Snape . 
" You managed to stop me eventually , though you wasted time and energy shouting . 
Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand . " 
" I'm trying , " said Harry angrily , " but you ' re not telling me how ! " 
" Manners , Potter , " said Snape dangerously . 
" Now , I want you to close your eyes . " 
Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told . 
" Clear your mind , Potter , " said Snape's cold voice . 
But Harry's anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom . 
Harry tried to empty his mind , tried not to think , or remember , or feel … 
" Let's go again … on the count of three … one - two - three - Legilimens ! " 
A great black dragon was rearing in front of him … his father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror … Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him … 
Harry was on his knees again , his face buried in his hands , his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull . 
" Get up ! " said Snape sharply . 
" Get up ! 
You are not trying , you are making no effort . 
You are allowing me access to memories you fear , handing me weapons ! " 
Harry stood up again , his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard . 
" I told you to empty yourself of emotion ! " 
" Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord ! " said Snape savagely . 
" Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves , who cannot control their emotions , who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easily - weak people , in other words - they stand no chance against his powers ! 
" I am not weak , " said Harry in a low voice , fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment . 
" Then prove it ! 
spat Snape . 
" Control your anger , discipline your mind ! 
Legilimens ! " 
He was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letterbox shut … a hundred Dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds towards him … he was running along a windowless passage with Mr . Weasley … they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor … Harry expected to go through it … but Mr . Weasley led him off to the left , down a flight of stone steps … 
" I KNOW ! 
I KNOW ! " 
He was on all fours again on Snape's office floor , his scar was prickling unpleasantly , but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant . 
He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at him , his wand raised . 
It looked as though , this time , Snape had lifted the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back . 
" What happened then , Potter ? " he asked , eyeing Harry intently . 
" I saw - I remembered , " Harry panted . 
" I ' ve just realized … " 
" Realized what ? " asked Snape sharply . 
Harry did not answer at once ; he was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as he rubbed his forehead … 
He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months , without once realizing that it was a real place . 
Now , seeing the memory again , he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr . Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry ; it was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries and Mr . Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort's snake . 
He looked up at Snape . 
" What's in the Department of Mysteries ? " 
" What did you say ? " Snape asked quietly and Harry saw , with deep satisfaction , that Snape was unnerved . 
" I said , what's in the Department of Mysteries , sir ? " Harry said . 
" Because " said Harry , watching Snape's face closely , " that corridor I ' ve just seen - I ' ve been dreaming about it for months — I ' ve just recognized it - it leads to the Department of Mysteries … and I think Voldemort wants something from — " 
" I have told you not to say the Dark Lord's name ! " 
They glared at each other . 
Harrys scar seared again , but he did not care . 
Snape looked agitated ; but when he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned . 
" I want you back here same time on Wednesday . 
We will continue work then . " 
" Fine , " said Harry . 
He was desperate to get out of Snape's office and find Ron and Hermione . 
" You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep ; empty it , make it blank and calm , you understand ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry , who was barely listening . 
" And be warned , Potter … I shall know if you have not practiced " 
" Right , " Harry mumbled . 
He picked up his schoolbag , swung it over his shoulder and hurried towards the office door . 
As he opened it , he glanced back at Snape , who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head . 
Harry left without another word , closing the door carefully behind him , his scar still throbbing painfully . 
Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library , where they were working on Umbridge's most recent ream of homework . 
The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince's shoes , as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly , breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books . 
Harry felt shivery ; his scar was still aching , he felt almost feverish . 
When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione , he caught sight of himself in the window opposite ; he was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual . 
" How did it go ? " 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " 
" Listen … I ' ve just realized something " 
And he told them what he had just seen and deduced . 
" So … so are you saying … " whispered Ron , as Madam Pince swept past , squeaking slightly , " that the weapon - the thing You - Know - Who's after — is in the Ministry of Magic ? " " In the Department of Mysteries , it's got to be , " H arry whispered . 
" I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it's definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him . " 
" Of course , " she breathed . 
" Of course what ? " said Ron rather impatiently . 
" Ron , think about it … Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic … it must have been that one , it's too much of a coincidence ! " 
" How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he's on our side ? " said Ron . 
" Well , I don't know , " Hermione admitted . 
" That is a bit odd … " 
" So what's in the Department of Mysteries ? " 
Harry asked Ron . 
" I know they call the people who work in there ' Unspeakables ' , " said Ron , frowning . 
" It's not weird at all , it makes perfect sense , " said Hermione . 
For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it . 
" I just feel a bit … I don't like Occlumency much . " 
But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement ; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise . 
" Headless Hats ! " shouted George , as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students . 
Fred swept the hat on to his head , beaming . 
For a second he merely looked rather stupid ; then both hat and head vanished . 
" And off again ! " shouted George , and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder ; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink - feathered hat from it . 
" How do those hats work , then ? " said Hermione , distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely . 
" I mean , obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell , but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object … I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though . " 
Harry did not answer ; he was feeling ill . 
" I'm going to have to do this tomorrow , " he muttered , pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it . 
Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag , withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively . 
Hermione beamed at it . 
" I think I ' ll go to bed , " said Harry , stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got . 
He walked across the common room , dodging George , who tried to put a Headless Hat on him , and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys'dormitories . 
He was feeling sick again , just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake , but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right . 
He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head . 
He did not know where he was , whether he was standing or lying down , he did not even know his own name . 
Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears … he was happier than he had been in a very long time … jubilant , ecstatic , triumphant … a wonderful , wonderful thing had happened … 
" Harry ? 
The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain . 
The happiness was draining out of him , but the laughter continued … 
He opened his eyes and , as he did so , he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth . 
The moment he realized this , it died away ; Harry lay panting on the floor , staring up at the ceiling , the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly . 
Ron was bending over him , looking very worried . 
" What happened ? " he said . 
" I … dunno … " Harry gasped , sitting up again . 
" He's really happy … really happy … " 
" Something good's happened , " mumbled Harry . 
He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr . Weasley and felt very sick . 
The words came , just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room , as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth , yet he knew they were true . 
He took deep breaths , willing himself not to vomit all over Ron . 
He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time . 
" Hermione told me to come and check on you , " said Ron in a low voice , helping Harry to his feet . 
He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him towards his bed . 
He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind's resistance rather than strengthening it , and he wondered , with a feeling of great trepidation , what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years . 
Harry's question was answered the very next morning . 
When Hermione's DailyProphet arrived she smoothed it out , gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her . 
" What ? " said Harry and Ron together . 
For an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten blackand - white photographs that filled the whole of the front page , nine showing wizards ' faces and the tenth , a witch's . 
Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering ; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures , looking insolent . 
Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban . 
Antonin Dolohov , read the legend beneath a wizard with a long , pale , twisted face who was sneering up at Harry , convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett . 
Augustus Rookwood , said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture , looking bored , convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic secrets to He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named . 
But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch . 
Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page . 
She had long , dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture , though he had seen it sleek , thick and shining . 
Like Sirius , she retained vestiges of great good looks , but something - perhaps Azkaban - had taken most of her beauty . 
Bellatrix Lestrange , convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom . 
Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures , which Harry , concentrating on Bellatrix , had not yet read . 
" Black ? " said Harry loudly . 
" Not - ? " 
" Not so loud - just read it ! " 
The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from 
Speaking to reporters in his private office , Cornelius Fudge , Minister for Magic , confirmed that ten high - security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals . 
" We find ourselves , most unfortunately , in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped , " said Fudge last night . 
An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help , and we must remember that Black , as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban , would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps . 
We think it likely that these individuals , who include Black's cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange , have rallied around Black as their leader . 
We are , however , doing all we can to round up the criminals , and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious . 
" There you are , Harry , " said Ron , looking awestruck . 
" That's why he was happy last night . " 
" I don't believe this , " snarled Harry , " Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius ? " 
" What other options does he have ? " said Hermione bitterly . 
I mean , he's spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars , hasn't he ? " 
Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall . 
He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page , but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione . 
There they all were , talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish , when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort's ranks . 
He glanced up at the staff table . 
It was a different story there : Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation , both looking extremely grave . 
Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon . 
Meanwhile , at the far end of the table , Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge . 
She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently . 
" Oh my - " said Hermione wonderingly , still staring at the newspaper . 
" What now ? " said Harry quickly ; he was feeling jumpy . 
" It's … horrible , " said Hermione , looking shaken . 
She fold ed back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to Harry and Ron . 
St . Mungo's Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode , 49 , was discovered dead in his bed , strangled by a potted - plant . 
Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr . Bode , who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death . 
Healer Miriam Strout , who was in charge of Mr . Bodes ward at the time of the incident , has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday , but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement : 
Mungo's deeply regrets the death of Mr . Bode , whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident . 
" We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout , busy over the Christmas period , overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr . Bode's bedside table . 
As his speech and mobility improved , Healer Strout encouraged Mr . Bode to look after the plant himself , unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom , but a cutting of Devil's Snare which , when touched by the convalescent Mr . Bode , throttled him instantly . 
Mungo's is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward . " 
" Bode … " said Ron . " Bode . 
It rings a bell … " 
" We saw him , " Hermione whispered . 
" In St . Mungo's , remember ? 
He was in the bed opposite Lockhart's , just lying there , staring at the ceiling . 
And we saw the Devil's Snare arrive . 
She - the Healer - said it was a Christmas present . " 
Harry looked back at the story . 
A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat . 
We ' ve seen it before … we could ' ve stopped this from happening . " 
" Who expects Devils Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant ? " said Ron sharply . 
" It's not our fault , whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame ! 
They must be a real prat , why didn't they check what they were buying ? " 
" Oh , come on , Ron ! " said Hermione shakily . 
" I don't think anyone could put Devils Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it ? 
This - this was murder … a clever murder , as well … if the plant was sent anonymously , how's anyone ever going to find out who did it ? " 
Harry was not thinking about Devil's Snare . 
He was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing and the sallow - faced man who had got in on the . 
" I met Bode , " he said slowly . 
" I saw him at the Ministry with your dad . " 
" I ' ve heard Dad talk about him at home ! 
He was an Unspeakable - he worked in the Department of Mysteries ! " 
They looked at each other for a moment , then Hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her , closed it , glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front , then leapt to her feet . 
" Where are you going ? " said Ron , startled . 
" It … well , I don't know whether … but it's worth trying … and I'm the only one who can . " 
" I hate it when she does that , " grumbled Ron , as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own , slower way out of the Great Hall . 
" Would it kill her to tell us what she's up to for once ? 
It'd take her about ten more seconds - hey , Hagrid ! " 
Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the Entrance Hall , waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass . 
He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose . 
" All righ ' , you two ? " he said , trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace . 
" Are you okay , Hagrid ? " asked Harry , following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws . 
" Fine , fine , " said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness ; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened - looking Professor Vector , who was passing . 
" You ' re on probation ? " said Ron very loudly , so that many of the passing students looked around curiously . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid . 
See yeh , Harry … Ron … " 
He trudged away , out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds . 
Harry watched him go , wondering how much more bad news he could stand . 
The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days , but to Harry's indignation , hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it ; indeed , some people , Draco Malfoy prominent among them , seemed positively gleeful . 
As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St . Mungo's , Harry , Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared . 
There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now : the ten escaped Death Eaters , whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers . 
Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade , that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts , just as Sirius Black had once done . 
Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts ; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary . 
There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students , who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors : Susan Bones , whose uncle , aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten , said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry . 
It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days , yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers ' voices . 
They sounded curious rather than hostile now , and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophets version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress . 
In their confusion and fear , these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them : the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year . 
It was not only the students ' mood that had changed . 
" They obviously can't talk freely in the staff room any more , " said Hermione in a low voice , as she , Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall , Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day . 
" Not with Umbridge there . " 
" Reckon they know anything new ? " said Ron , gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers . 
" If they do , we ' re not going to hear about it , are we ? " said Harry angrily . 
" Not after Decree … 
what number are we on now ? " 
For new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout : 
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOROF HOGWARTS 
Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach . 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty - six . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , High Inquisitor 
This latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students . 
Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class . 
" Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts , Professor ! 
That's not information relating to your subject ! " 
When Harry next saw Lee , the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly . 
Harry had thought the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little , that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved Fudge . 
It seemed , however , to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control . 
She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long , and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first . 
Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard . 
She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room , interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology , insisting that she predicted students ' answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball , the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn . 
Several times he passed her in the corridors - in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room - muttering wildly to herself , wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder , and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry . 
If he had not been so worried about Hagrid , he would have felt sorry for her - but if one of them was to be ousted from their job , there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain . 
Unfortunately , Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney . 
Though he seemed to be following Hermione's advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a Crup — a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail - since before Christmas , he too seemed to have lost his nerve . 
He was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons , losing the thread of what he was saying to the class , answering questions wrongly , and all the time glancing anxiously at Umbridge . 
He was also more distant with Harry , Ron and Hermione than he had ever been before , and had expressly forbidden them to visit him after dark . 
" If she catches yeh , it ' ll be all of our necks on the line , " he told them flatly , and with no desire to do anything that might jeoparize his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings . 
It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living : visits to Hagrid's house , letters from Sirius , his Firebolt and Quidditch . 
Harry was pleased to see that all of them , even Zacharias Smith , had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose , but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville . 
The news of his parents ' attackers ' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him . 
He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry , Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St . Mungo's and , taking their lead from him , they had kept quiet about it too . 
Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers ' escape . 
In fact , Neville barely spoke during the D . A . meetings any more , but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter - curse Harry taught them , his plump face screwed up in concentration , apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room . 
He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm - a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker - only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville . 
On the contrary Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson . 
He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemorts mood , and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape . 
What was more , he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night , dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door . 
" Maybe it's a bit like an illness , " said Hermione , looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron . 
It has to get worse before it gets better . " 
" I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night . " 
He rubbed his forehead angrily . 
" I just wish the door would open , I'm sick of standing staring at it - " 
" That's not funny , " said Hermione sharply . 
" Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all , or he wouldn't have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency . 
You ' re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons . " 
" I am working ! " said Harry nettled . 
" You try it some time - Snape trying to get inside your head - it's not a bundle of laughs , you know ! " 
" Maybe … " said Ron slowly . 
" Maybe what ? " said Hermione , rather snappishly . 
" Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind , " said Ron darkly . 
" What do you mean ? " said Hermione . 
" Well , maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry … " 
Harry and Hermione stared at him . 
Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other . 
" Maybe , " he said again , in a lower voice , " he's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider … make it easier for You - Know — " 
" Shut up , Ron , " said Hermione angrily . 
" How many times have you suspected Snape , and when have you ever been right ? 
Dumbledore trusts him , he works for the Order , that ought to be enough . " 
" And if we can't trust Dumbledore , we can't trust anyone . " 
With so much to worry about and so much to do - startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth - years working until past midnight , secret D . A . sessions and regular classes with Snape - January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast . 
Before Harry knew it , February had arrived , bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year . 
Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together , but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in her company . 
On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully . 
He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls . 
Hedwig was not there - not that Harry had expected her - but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down . 
If it hadn't come today … " she said , eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment . 
Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face . 
" Listen , Harry , " she said , looking up at him , " this is really important . 
Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday ? " 
" Well … I dunno , " said Harry uncertainly . 
We never said what we were going to do . " 
" Well , bring her along if you must , " said Hermione urgently . 
" But will you come ? " 
" I haven't got time to tell you now , I ' ve got to answer this quickly . " 
And she hurried out of the Great Hall , the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other . 
" Are you coming ? " 
Harry asked Ron , but he shook his head , looking glum . 
" I can't come into Hogsmeade at all ; Angelina wants a full day's training . 
Like it's going to help ; we ' re the worst team I ' ve ever seen . 
You should see Sloper and Kirke , they ' re pathetic , even worse than I am . " 
" It's because you ' re good when you ' re on form , that's why , " said Harry irritably . 
He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron's plight , when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff . 
Ron seemed to have noticed Harrys tone , because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast , and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards . 
Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry , after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon , proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho , feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about . 
She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors , looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long pony - tail . 
Harry's feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides . 
" Hi , " said Harry . 
They stared at each other for a moment , then Harry said , " Well - er — shall we go , then ? " 
" Oh - yes … " 
They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch , occasionally catching each other's eye and grinning shiftily , but not talking to each other . 
Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air , finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward . 
It was a fresh , breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them . 
" You really miss it , don't you ? " said Cho . 
He looked round and saw her watching him . 
" Yeah , " sighed Harry . 
" I do . " 
" Remember the first time we played against each other , in the third year ? " she asked him . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , grinning . 
" You kept blocking me . " 
" And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to , " said Cho , smiling reminiscently . 
" Nah , it was Puddlemere United ; I saw him at the World Cup last year . " 
" Oh , I saw you there , too , remember ? 
We were on the same campsite . 
The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates . 
Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her - no more difficult , in fact , than talking to Ron and Hermione - and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them , including Pansy Parkinson . 
" Urgh , Chang , I don't think much of your taste … at least Diggory was good - looking ! " 
The girls sped up , talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho , leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake . 
Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch , and Cho , slightly flushed , was watching her feet . 
" So … where d ' you want to go ? " Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade . 
The High Street was full of students ambling up and down , peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements . 
They wandered towards Dervish and Banges . 
A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it . 
They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters . 
The poster , By Order of the Ministry of Magic , offered a thousand - Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured . 
" It's funny , isn't it , " said Cho in a low voice , gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters , " remember when that Sirius Black escaped , and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him ? 
And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere … " 
" Yeah , that is weird . " 
They had not only let the Death Eaters escape , they weren't bothering to look for them … it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now . 
The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed . 
It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft's ; cold , heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck . 
" Um … d ' you want to get a coffee ? " said Cho tentatively , as the rain began to fall more heavily . 
" Yeah , all right , " said Harry , looking around . 
" Oh , there's a really nice place just up here ; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's ? " she said brightly , leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before . 
It was a cramped , steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows . 
Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge's office . 
" Er … yeah , " said Harry untruthfully . 
" Look , she's decorated it for Valentine's Day ! " said Cho , indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small , circular tables , occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants . 
" Aaah … " 
They sat down at the last remaining table , which was over by the steamy window . 
Roger Davies , the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl . 
They were holding hands . 
The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable , particularly when , looking around the teashop , he saw that it was full of nothing but couples , all of them holding hands . 
Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand . 
" What can I get you , m'dears ? " said Madam Puddifoot , a very stout woman with a shiny black bun , squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty . 
" Two coffees , please , " said Cho . 
In the time it took for their coffees to arrive , Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl . 
Harry wished they wouldn't ; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete . 
He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window , but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside . 
To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho , he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub . 
After a few more painful minutes , Cho mentioned Umbridge . 
Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her , but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D . A . meetings it did not last very long . 
Silence fell again . 
Harry wasvery conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around forsomething else to say . 
" Er … listen , d ' you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime ? 
I'm meeting Hermione Granger there . " 
Cho raised her eyebrows . 
Today ? " 
Well , she asked me to , so I thought I would . 
D ' you want to come with me ? 
She said it wouldn't matter if you did . " 
On the contrary , her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding . 
A few more minutes passed in total silence , Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup . 
Beside them , Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the lips . 
Cho's hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it . 
Just do it , he told himself , as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest , just reach out and grab it . 
Amazing , how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair … But just as he moved his hand forwards , Cho took hers off the table . 
She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression . 
" He asked me out , you know , " she said in a quiet voice . 
Roger . 
Harry , who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table , could not think why she was telling him this . 
If she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by Roger Davies , why had she agreed to come out with him ? 
He said nothing . 
Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them ; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink . 
" I came in here with Cedric last year , " said Cho . 
He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now , while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads . 
Cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again . 
" I ' ve been meaning to ask you for ages … did Cedric - did he - m - m - mention me at all before he died ? " 
" Well - no - " he said quietly . 
" There - there wasn't time for him to say anything . 
You support the Tornados , right ? " 
His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery . 
To his horror , he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again , just as they had been after the last D . A . meeting before Christmas . 
" Look , " he said desperately , leaning in so that nob ody else could overhear , " let's not talk about Cedric right now … let's talk about something else . " 
" I thought , " she said , tears spattering down on to the table , " I thought you'd u - u - understand ! 
I need to talk about it ! 
Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too ! 
I mean , you saw it happen , d - didn't you ? " 
" Well - I have talked about it , " Harry said in a whisper , " to Ron and Hermione , but - " 
" Oh , you ' ll talk to Hermione Granger ! " she said shrilly , her face now shining with tears . 
" But you won't talk to me ! P - perhaps it would be best if we just … just p - paid and you went and met up with Hermione G - Granger , like you obviously want to ! " 
Harry stared at her , utterly bewildered , as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it . 
" Cho ? " he said weakly , wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho . 
" I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you ' re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me … how many are you meeting after Hermione ? " 
" It's not like that ! " said Harry , and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed , which he realized a split second too late was also a mistake . 
Cho sprang to her feet . 
The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now . 
" I ' ll see you around , Harry " she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door , wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain . 
" Cho ! " Harry called after her , but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle . 
There was total silence within the teashop . 
He threw a Galleon down on to the table , shook pink confetti out of his hair , and followed Cho out of the door . 
It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen . 
He simply did not understand what had happened ; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine . 
" Women ! " he muttered angrily , sloshing down the rain - washed street with his hands in his pockets . 
Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe ? " 
He turned right and broke into a splashy run , and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks . 
He knew he was too early to meet Hermione , but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time . 
He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around . 
Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner , looking morose . 
" Hi , Hagrid ! " he said , when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him . 
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognized him . 
Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises . 
" Oh , it's yeh , Harry , " said Hagrid . 
" Yeh all right ? " 
" Yeah , I'm fine , " lied Harry ; but , next to this battered and mournful - looking Hagrid , he felt he didn't really have much to complain about . 
" Er - are you okay ? " 
" Me ? " said Hagrid . 
He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard , which was the size of a large bucket , and sighed . 
Harry didn't know what to say to him . 
They sat side by side in silence for a moment . 
" Er - " said Harry . 
He took a great swig from his tankard . 
" Makes a diff ' rence , havin ' a decent family , " he said . 
" Yeah … I s ' pose , " said Harry cautiously . 
Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood . 
And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye . 
" Hagrid , " said Harry , unable to stop himself , " where are you getting all these injuries ? " 
" All those ! " said Harry , pointing at Hagrid's face . 
He drained his tankard , set it back on the table and got to his feet . 
And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched , and disappeared into the torrential rain . 
Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something , but he seemed determined not to accept help . 
What was going on ? 
But before Harry could think about it any further , he heard a voice calling his name . 
" Harry ! Harry , over here ! " 
Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room . 
He got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub . 
He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone . 
She was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined : Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter , ex - journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione's least favorite people in the world . 
" You ' re early ! " said Hermione , moving along to give him room to sit down . 
" I thought you were with Cho , I wasn't expecting you for another hour at least ! " 
" Cho ? " said Rita at once , twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at Harry . 
She snatched up her crocodile - skin handbag and groped within it . 
" So you can put that away right now . " 
Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap , she snapped her bag shut again . 
" What are you up to ? " 
Harry asked , sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione . 
" Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived , " said Rita , taking a large slurp of her drink . 
" I suppose I'm allowed to talk to him , am I ? " she shot at Hermione . 
" Yes , I suppose you are , " said Hermione coldly . 
The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face . 
The scarlet paint on her two - inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses . 
She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth , " Pretty girl , is she , Harry ? " 
" One more word about Harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise , " said Hermione irritably . 
" What deal ? " said Rita , wiping her mouth on the back of her hand . 
Oh , one of these days … " She took a deep shuddering breath . 
" Yes , yes , one of these days you ' ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me , " said Hermione indifferently . 
" They ' ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help , " said Rita , shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper , " How has that made you feel , Harry ? 
" He feels angry , of course , " said Hermione in a hard , clear voice . 
" Because he's told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him . " 
" So you actually stick to it , do you , that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back ? " said Rita , lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag . 
" There were a dozen - odd Death Eaters there as well . 
Want their names ? " 
" I'd love them , " breathed Rita , now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen . 
And then , beneath a nice big photograph of you , ' Disturbed teenage survivor of You - Know - Who'sattack , Harry Potter , 15 , caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters … ' " 
The Quick - Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died . 
" But of course , " she said , lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione , " Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there , would she ? " 
" As a matter of fact , " said Hermione sweetly , " that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want . " 
Rita stared at her . 
So did Harry . 
Luna , on the other hand , sang Weasley is our King dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick . 
" You want me to report what he says about He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? " Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice . 
" Yes , I do , " said Hermione . 
" The true story . 
All the facts . 
He ' ll give you all the details , he ' ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there , he ' ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now - oh , get a grip on yourself , " she added contemptuously , throwing a napkin across the table , for , at the sound of Voldemort's name , Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself . 
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat , still staring at Hermione . 
Then she said baldly , " The Prophet wouldn't print it . 
Now , if you let me write the story from that angle - " 
" We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles ! " said Hermione angrily . 
I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth ! " 
" There's no market for a story like that , " said Rita coldly . 
" You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them , " said Hermione irritably . 
Rita gave Hermione a long , hard look . 
Then , leaning forwards across the table towards her , she said in a businesslike tone , " All right , Fudge is leaning on the Prophet , but it comes to the same thing . 
They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light . 
Nobody wants to read it . 
It's against the public mood . 
People just don't want to believe You - Know - Whos back . " 
" So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear , does it ? " said Hermione scathingly . 
Rita sat up straight again , her eyebrows raised , and drained her glass of Firewhisky . 
" The Prophet exists to sell itself , you silly girl , " she said coldly . 
He doesn't care about making money . " 
Rita looked disparagingly at Luna . 
" Probably , Twenty - Five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale ? " 
" No , " said Luna , dipping her onion back into her Gillywater , " he's the editor of The Quibbler . " 
" I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag . " 
" Well , this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit , isn't it ? " said Hermione pleasantly . 
" Luna says her father's quite happy to take Harry's interview . 
Rita stared at them both for a moment , then let out a great whoop of laughter . 
" The Quibbler ! " she said , cackling . 
" But the Daily Prophet's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it . 
I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn't a better explanation of what happened , and if there's an alternative story available , even if it is published in a - " she glanced sideways at Luna , " in a - well , an unusual magazine - I think they might be rather keen to read it . " 
" They do it because it's an honor and , of course , to see their names in print . " 
Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione . 
" I'm supposed to do this for free ? " 
" Well , yes , " said Hermione calmly , taking a sip of her drink . 
" Otherwise , as you very well know , I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus . 
Of course , the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban . " 
" I don't suppose I ' ve got any choice , have I ? " said Rita , her voice shaking slightly . 
She opened her crocodile bag once more , withdrew a piece of parchment , and raised her Quick - Quotes Quill . 
" Daddy will be pleased , " said Luna brightly . 
A muscle twitched in Rita's jaw . 
" Okay , Harry ? " said Hermione , turning to him . 
" Ready to tell the public the truth ? " 
" I suppose , " said Harry , watching Rita balancing the Quick - Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them . 
" Fire away , then , Rita , " said Hermione serenely , fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass . 
Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler , that her father was expecting a " ' lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple - Horned Snorkacks , ' " - " and of course , that ' ll be a very important story , so Harrys might have to wait for the following issue , " said Luna . 
Rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember , knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth . 
He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane , not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple - Horned Snorkacks . 
But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to dosomething , whether or not it worked … 
Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on Dean's other side , but Harry knew he was listening . 
" It's the right thing to do , Harry , " said Neville , who was sitting opposite him . 
He was rather pale , but went on in a low voice , " It must have been … tough … talking about it … was it ? " 
Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato . 
Seamus looked up , but when he caught Harrys eye he looked quickly back at his plate again . 
After a while , Dean , Seamus and Neville departed for the common room , leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron , who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice . 
Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her friend Marietta . 
Harry's stomach gave an unpleasant lurch , but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table , and sat down with her back to him . 
" Oh , I forgot to ask you , " said Hermione brightly , glancing over at the Ravenclaw table , " what happened on your date with Cho ? How come you were back so early ? " 
" Er … well , it was … " said Harry , pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds , " a complete fiasco , now you mention it . " 
And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot's teashop . 
He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione . 
" I mean , what was all that about ? 
What was going on ? " 
Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho's head and sighed . 
" Oh , Harry " she said sadly . 
" Well , I'm sorry , but you were a bit tactless . " 
" Me , tactless ? " said Harry , outraged . 
" One minute we were getting on fine , next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid teashop - how was I supposed to feel about that ? " 
" Well , you see , " said Hermione , with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an over - emotional toddler , " you shouldn't have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date . " 
" But , but , " spluttered Harry , " but - you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along , how was I supposed to do that without telling her ? " " You should have told her differently , " said Hermione , still with that maddeningly patient air . 
" You should have said it was really annoying , but I'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks , and you really didn't want to go , you'd much rather spend the whole day with her , but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please , please come along with you and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly . 
" But I don't think you ' re ugly , " said Harry , bemused . 
Hermione laughed . 
" Harry you ' re worse than Ron … well , no , you ' re not , " she sighed , as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy . 
" Look - you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me , so she tried to make you jealous . 
" Is that what she was doing ? " said Harry , as Ron dropped on to the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him . 
" Well , wouldn't it have been easier if she'd just asked me whether I liked her better than you ? " 
" Girls don't often ask questions like that , " said Hermione . 
" Well , they should ! " said Harry forcefully . 
" I'm not saying what she did was sensible , " said Hermione , as Ginny joined them , just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled . 
" I'm just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time . " 
" You should write a book , " Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes , " translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry fervently , looking over at the Ravenclaw table . 
Cho had just got up , and , still not looking at him , she left the Great Hall . 
Feeling rather depressed , he looked back at Ron and Ginny . 
" It was a nightmare , " said Ron in a surly voice . 
" Oh come on , " said Hermione , looking at Ginny , " I'm sure it wasn't that - " 
" Yes , it was , " said Ginny . 
" It was appalling . 
Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it . " 
Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner ; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework . 
Harry had been struggling with a new star - chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up . 
" Ron and Ginny not here ? " 
asked Fred , looking around as he pulled up a chair , and when Harry shook his head , he said , " Good . 
They're complete rubbish without us . " 
" Come on , Ginny's not bad , " said George fairly , sitting down next to Fred . 
" Actually , I dunno how she got so good , seeing how we never let her play with us . " 
" She's been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren't looking , " said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books . 
" Oh , " said George , looking mildly impressed . 
" Has Ron saved a goal yet ? " asked Hermione , peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms . 
" So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday . " 
He got up again and moved restlessly to the window , staring out across the dark grounds . 
" You know , Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for . " 
Hermione cast him a stern look . 
" Told you already , we ' re not fussed about NEWTs , " said Fred . " The Snackboxes are ready to roll , we found out how to get rid of those boils , just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts them , Lee put us on to it . " 
George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky . 
" I dunno if I even want to watch this match . 
If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself . " 
" Kill him , more like , " said Fred firmly . 
" That's the trouble with Quidditch , " said Hermione absent - mindedly , once again bent over her Runes translation , " it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses . " 
She looked up to find her copy of Spellman's Syllabary , and caught Fred , George and Harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces . 
" Well , it does ! " 
she said impatiently . 
" It's only a game , isn't it ? " 
" Hermione , " said Harry , shaking his head , " you ' re good on feelings and stuff , but you just don't understand about Quidditch . " 
" Maybe not , " she said darkly , returning to her translation , " but at least my happiness doesn't depend on Ron's goalkeeping ability . " 
And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her , by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either . 
The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short ; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty - two minutes of agony . 
It was hard to say what the worst thing was : Harry thought it was a close - run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save , Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat , and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle . 
The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points : Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose , so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty . 
" Good catch , " Harry told Ginny back in the common room , where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral . 
" I was lucky , " she shrugged . 
" It wasn't a very fast Snitch and Summerby's got a cold , he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment . 
Anyway , once you ' re back on the team - " 
" You ' re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school , " Ginny corrected him . 
" There's a difference . 
Anyway , once you ' re back , I think I ' ll try out for Chaser . 
Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal - scoring to Seeking anyway . " 
Harry looked over at Ron , who was hunched in a corner , staring at his knees , a bottle of Butterbeer clutched in his hand . 
" Angelina still won't let him resign , " Ginny said , as though reading Harry's mind . 
Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron , but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team . 
Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of Weasley is our King sung with great gusto by the Slytherins , who were now favorites to win the Quidditch Cup . 
Fred and George wandered over . 
" I haven't even got the heart to take the mickey out of him , " said Fred , looking over at Ron's crumpled figure . 
" - well , I ' ll save it for parties , eh ? " 
Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this . 
Out of respect for his feelings , Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself , so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to . 
Harry got into bed , thinking about the match . 
He was quite impressed by Ginny's performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner … there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke's ankle ; if Ginny hadn't hesitated , she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor . 
Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione . 
The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark . 
After a few minutes , however , he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept , as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson . 
He tried for a moment or two , but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them . 
Slowly , Ron's snores died away , to be replaced by the sound of deep , slow breathing . 
It took Harry much longer to get to sleep ; his body was tired , but it took his brain a long time to close down . 
He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes . 
He watched them happily for a while , then decided to go and find the other members of the D . A .. 
But when he left the room he found himself facing , not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy , but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall . 
He turned his head slowly to the left . 
There , at the far end of the windowless passage , was a plain , black door . 
He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last , and find the way to open it … he was feet from it , and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right - hand side … the door was ajar … he stretched out his hand to push it wide and - 
Ron gave a loud , rasping , genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness , to open a door that was hundreds of miles away . 
He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt . 
He knew he should not have seen the door , but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron … if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute . 
They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning . 
Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet : nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters , who , despite many reported sightings , had still not been caught . 
She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice ; as he had only received one note during the entire year , he was sure , when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him , that it had made a mistake . 
" Who ' re you after ? " he asked it , languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the recipient's name and address : 
Harry Potter , Great Hall , Hogwarts School 
Frowning , he made to take the letter from the owl , but before he could do so , three , four , five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position , treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first . 
" What's going on ? " Ron asked in amazement , as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones , screeching , hooting and flapping their wings . 
" Harry ! " said Hermione breathlessly , plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long , cylindrical package . 
" I think I know what this means - open this one first ! " 
Harry ripped off the brown packaging . 
Out rolled a tightly furled copy of the March edition of The Quibbler . 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover . 
In large red letters across this picture were the words : 
" It's good , isn't it ? " said Luna , who had drifted o ver to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between Fred and Ron . 
" It came out yesterday , I asked Dad to send you a free copy . 
I expect all these , " she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry , " are letters from readers . " 
" That's what I thought , " said Hermione eagerly . 
" Harry , d ' you mind if we - ? " 
" Help yourself , " said Harry , feeling slightly bemused . 
Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes . 
" This one's from a bloke who thinks you ' re off your rocker , " said Ron , glancing down his letter . 
" Ah well … " 
" This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St . Mungo's , " said Hermione , looking disappointed and crumpling up a second . 
" This one looks okay , though , " said Harry slowly , scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley . 
" Hey , she says she believes me ! " 
" Here's another one you ' ve convinced , Harry ! " said Hermione excitedly . 
" Having read your side of the story , I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly … little though I want to think that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has returned , I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth … Oh , this is wonderful ! " 
" Another one who thinks you ' re barking , " said Ron , throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder " … but this one says you ' ve got her converted and she now thinks you ' re a real hero - she's put in a photograph , too - wow ! " 
" What is going on here ? " said a falsely sweet , girlish voice . 
Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes . 
Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna , her bulging toad's eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry . 
Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly . 
" Why have you got all these letters , Mr . Potter ? " 
she asked slowly . 
" Is that a crime now ? " said Fred loudly . 
" Be careful , Mr . Weasley , or I shall have to put you in detention , " said Umbridge . 
Harry hesitated , but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet ; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridges attention . 
" People have written to me because I gave an interview , " said Harry . 
" About what happened to me last June . " 
For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this . 
Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before , but when he looked towards the Headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick . 
repeated Umbridge , her voice thinner and higher than ever . 
" What do you mean ? " 
" I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them , " said Harry . 
And he threw the copy of The Quibbler to her . 
She caught it and stared down at the cover . 
Her pale , doughy face turned an ugly , patchy violet . 
" When did you do this ? " she asked , her voice trembling slightly . 
" Last Hogsmeade weekend , " said Harry . 
She looked up at him , incandescent with rage , the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers . 
" There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you , Mr . Potter , " she whispered . 
" How you dare … how you could … " She took a deep breath . 
" I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies . 
The message , apparently , has still not sunk in . 
She stalked away , clutching The Quibbler to her chest , the eyes of many students following her . 
By mid - morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school , not just on house noticeboards , but in the corridors and classrooms too . 
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS 
Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quibbler will be expelled . 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty - seven . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , High Inquisitor 
For some reason , every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure . 
" What exactly are you so happy about ? " 
Harry asked her . 
" Oh , Harry , don't you see ? " Hermione breathed . 
" If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview , it was banning it ! " 
And it seemed that Hermione was quite right . 
By the end of the day , though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school , the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other . 
Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes , discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons , while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls ' toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes . 
" Then they spotted me , and obviously they know I know you , so they bombarded me with questions , " Hermione told Harry , her eyes shining , " and Harry , I think they believe you , I really do , I think you ' ve finally got them convinced ! " 
Meanwhile , Professor Umbridge was stalking the school , stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets : Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler , but the students were several steps ahead of her . 
Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it . 
The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty - six , but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same . 
Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can ; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of Charms , said , " Shh ! " and hurried away ; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class , and a very disapproving Umbridge , that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all , but would live to a ripe old age , become Minister for Magic and have twelve children . 
But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day . 
Before he knew what had happened , her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear , " I'm really , really sorry . 
He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it , but very glad they were on speaking terms again , and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again . 
" I just wanted to say , " he mumbled , squinting at Harry's left knee , " I believe you . 
And I ' ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam . " 
If anything more was needed to complete Harry's happiness , it was the reaction he got from Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library ; they were with a weedy - looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott . 
They looked round at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment : Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe . 
Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this : he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters . 
" And the best bit , " whispered Hermione gleefully , as they left the library , " is they can't contradict you , because they can't admit they ' ve read the article ! " 
Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night . 
Daringly , Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall , so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings , occasionally saying things like ' THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS ' and ' EAT DUNG , UMBRIDGE ' in a booming voice . 
Hermione did not find this very amusing ; she said it interfered with her concentration , and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation . 
Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two , especially when the talking spell had started to wear off , so that it merely shouted disconnected words like ' DUNG ' and ' UMBRIDGE ' at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice . 
In fact , it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again . 
To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him , asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time , he announced that he too needed an early night . 
The dormitory was empty when he reached it . 
He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed ; it felt soothing against his scar . 
He rolled over on to his side , closed his eyes , and fell asleep almost at once … 
He was standing in a dark , curtained room lit by a single branch of candles . 
His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him . 
They were long - fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large , pale spiders against the dark velvet of the chair . 
Beyond the chair , in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles , knelt a man in black robes . 
" I have been badly advised , it seems , " said Harry , in a high , cold voice that pulsed with anger . 
" Master , I crave your pardon , " croaked the man kneeling on the floor . 
The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight . 
He seemed to be trembling . 
" I do not blame you , Rookwood , " said Harry in that cold , cruel voice . 
He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it , closer to the man cowering on the floor , until he stood directly over him in the darkness , looking down from a far greater height than usual . 
asked Harry . 
" Yes , My Lord , yes … I used to work in the Department after - after all … " 
" Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it . " 
" Bode could never have taken it , Master … Bode would have known he could not … undoubtedly , that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse … " 
" Stand up , Rookwood , " whispered Harry . 
His face was pockmarked ; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight . 
" You have done well to tell me this , " said Harry . 
" Very well … I have wasted months on fruitless schemes , it seems … but no matter … we begin again , from now . 
You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude , Rookwood … " 
" I shall need your help . 
I shall need all the information you can give me . " 
" Of course , My Lord , of course … anything … " 
" Very well … you may go . 
Rookwood scurried backwards , bowing , and disappeared through a door . 
Left alone in the dark room , Harry turned towards the wall . 
A cracked , age - spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows . 
Harry moved towards it . 
His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness … a face whiter than a skull … red eyes with slits for pupils … 
Harry flailed around madly , became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed . 
For a few seconds he did not know where he was ; he was convinced he was about to see the white , skulllike face looming at him out of the dark again , then very near to him Ron's voice spoke . 
" Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here ! " 
Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight , flat on his back , his scar searing with pain . 
Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed ; one arm was out of his robes . 
" Has someone been attacked again ? " asked Ron , pulling Harry roughly to his feet . 
Is it that snake ? " 
" No - everyone's fine - " gasped Harry , whose forehead felt as though it were on fire . 
" Well … Avery isn't … he's in trouble … he gave him the wrong information … Voldemort's really angry " 
Harry groaned and sank , shaking , on to his bed , rubbing his scar . 
" What are you talking about ? " said Ron , sounding scared . 
" D ' you mean … did you just see You - Know - Who ? " 
" I was You - Know - Who , " said Harry , and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face , to check that they were no longer deathly white and long - fingered . 
" He was with Rookwood , he's one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban , remember ? 
Rookwood's just told him Bode couldn't have done it . " 
" Done what ? " 
" Remove something … he said Bode would have known he couldn't have done it … Bode was under the Imperius Curse … I think he said Malfoy's dad put it on him . " 
Ron said . 
" But - Harry , that's got to be - " 
" The weapon , " Harry finished the sentence for him . 
" I know " 
The dormitory door opened ; Dean and Seamus came in . 
Harry swung his legs back into bed . 
He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened , seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter . 
" Did you say , " murmured Ron , putting his head close to Harry's on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table , " that you were You - Know - Who ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry quietly . 
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water ; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest . 
" Harry , " he said , as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily , pulling off their robes and talking , " you ' ve got to tell - " 
" I wouldn't have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency . 
I'm supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out . 
That's what they want . " 
He got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron's mattress creak as he , too , lay back down . 
Somewhere , he knew , Avery was being punished . 
Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened ; they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard . 
Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard , Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember . 
When he had finished , she said nothing at all for a few moments , but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George , who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard . 
" So that's why they killed him , " she said quietly , withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last . 
" When Bode tried to steal this weapon , something funny happened to him . 
I think there must be defensive spells on it , or around it , to stop people touching it . 
But remember what the Healer told us ? 
He was recovering . 
I mean , the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift . 
Once he'd got his voice back , he'd explain what he'd been doing , wouldn't he ? 
They would have known he'd been sent to steal the weapon . 
Of course , it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him . 
" In the - hang on … " he said slowly . 
" He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day ! 
Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing , but what if - " 
" Sturgis ! " gasped Hermione , looking thunderstruck . 
" Sorry ? " said Ron , looking bewildered . 
" Sturgis Podmore - " said Hermione breathlessly , " arrested for trying to get through a door ! 
Lucius Malfoy must have got him too ! 
I bet he did it the day you saw him there , Harry . 
Sturgis had Moody's Invisibility Cloak , right ? 
So , what if he was standing guard by the door , invisible , and Malfoy heard him move - or guessed someone was there - or just did the Imperius Curse on the off - chance there'd be a guard there ? 
So , when Sturgis next had an opportunity - probably when it was his turn on guard duty again - he tried to get into the Department to steal the weapon for Voldemort - Ron , be quiet - but he got caught and sent to Azkaban … " 
She gazed at Harry . 
" And now Rookwood's told Voldemort how to get the weapon ? " 
" I didn't hear all the conversation , but that's what it sounded like , " said Harry . 
" Rookwood used to work there … maybe Voldemort ' ll send Rookwood to do it ? " 
Hermione nodded , apparently still lost in thought . 
Then , quite abruptly , she said , " But you shouldn't have seen this at all , Harry . " 
" What ? " he said , taken aback . 
" You ' re supposed to be learning how to close your m ind to this sort of thing , " said Hermione , suddenly stern . 
" I know I am , " said Harry . 
" But - " 
" Well , I think we should just try and forget what you saw , " said Hermione firmly . 
Harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day , which proved to be another bad one . 
When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors , they were laughing at Gryffindor's abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff ; the Slytherins were singing Weasley is our King so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation . 
The week did not improve as it progressed . 
Harry received two more D's in Potions ; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack ; and he couldn't stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort - though he didn't bring it up with Ron and Hermione again ; he didn't want another telling - off from Hermione . 
He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it , but that was out of the question , so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind . 
Unfortunately , the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been . 
" Get up , Potter . " 
A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood , Harry was to be found , yet again , kneeling on the floor of Snape's office , trying to clear his head . 
" That last memory , " said Snape . 
" What was it ? " 
" I don't know , " said Harry , getting wearily to his feet . 
He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth . 
" You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet ? " 
" No , " said Snape softly . 
" I mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room … " 
" It's … nothing , " said Harry . 
Snape's dark eyes bored into Harry's . 
Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency , Harry blinked and looked away . 
" How do that man and that room come to be inside your head , Potter ? " said Snape . 
" It - " said Harry , looking everywhere but at Snape , " it was - just a dream I had . " 
" A dream ? " repeated Snape . 
There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid . 
" You do know why we are here , don't you , Potter ? " said Snape , in a low , dangerous voice . 
" Yes , " said Harry stiffly . 
" Remind me why we are here , Potter . " 
" So I can learn Occlumency , " said Harry , now glaring at a dead eel . 
" Correct , Potter . 
And dim though you may be - " Harry looked back at Snape , hating him " - I would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress . 
How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had ? " 
" Just that one , " lied Harry . 
Maybe they make you feel special - important ? " 
" No , they don't , " said Harry , his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand . 
" That is just as well , Potter , " said Snape coldly , " because you are neither special nor important , and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters . " 
" No - that's your job , isn't it ? " 
Harry shot at him . 
For a long moment they stared at each other , Harry convinced he had gone too far . 
" Yes , Potter , " he said , his eyes glinting . 
" That is my job . 
Now , if you are ready , we will start again . " 
He raised his wand : " One — two - three - Legilimens ! " 
A hundred Dementors were swooping towards Harry across the lake in the grounds … he screwed up his face in concentration … they were coming closer … he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods … yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him , his eyes fixed on Harry's face , muttering under his breath … and somehow , Snape was growing clearer , and the Dementors were growing fainter … 
Harry raised his own wand . 
" Protego ! " 
Snape staggered - his wand flew upwards , away from Harry - and suddenly Harry's mind was teeming with memories that were not his : a hook - nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman , while a small dark - haired boy cried in a corner … a greasy - haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom , pointing his wand at the ceiling , shooting down flies … a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick - 
Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest ; he staggered several steps backwards , hit some of the shelves covering Snape's walls and heard something crack . 
Snape was shaking slightly , and was very white in the face . 
The back of Harry's robes was damp . 
One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it ; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion . 
" Reparo , " hissed Snape , and the jar sealed itself at once . 
" Well , Potter … that was certainly an improvement … " Panting slightly , Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson , almost as though he was checking they were still there . 
" I don't remember telling you to use a Shield Charm … but there is no doubt that it was effective … " 
Harry did not speak ; he felt that to say anything might be dangerous . 
He was sure he had just broken into Snape's memories , that he had just seen scenes from Snape's childhood . 
It was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes . 
" Let's try again , shall we ? " said Snape . 
Harry felt a thrill of dread ; he was about to pay for what had just happened , he was sure of it . 
They moved back into position with the desk between them , Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time . 
" On the count of three , then , " said Snape , raising his wand once more . 
" One - two - " Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before Snape cried , " Legilimens ! " 
He was hurtling along the corridor towards the Department of Mysteries , past the blank stone walls , past the torches - the plain black door was growing ever larger ; he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it , he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light - The door had flown open ! 
He was through it at last , inside a black - walled , black - floored circular room lit with blue - flamed candles , and there were more doors all around him - he needed to go on - but which door ought he to take - ? 
" POTTER ! " 
Harry opened his eyes . 
He was flat on his back again with no memory of having gotten there ; he was also panting as though he really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor , really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room . 
" Explain yourself ! " said Snape , who was standing over him , looking furious . 
" I … dunno what happened , " said Harry truthfully , st anding up . 
There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish . 
" I ' ve never seen that before . 
I mean , I told you , I ' ve dreamed about the door … but it's never opened before " 
" You are not working hard enough ! " 
For some reason , Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before , when Harry had seen into his teacher's memories . 
" You are lazy and sloppy , Potter , it is small wonder that the Dark Lord - " 
" Can you tell me something , sir ? " said Harry , firing up again . 
" Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord ? 
I ' ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that . " 
Snape opened his mouth in a snarl - and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room . 
Snapes head jerked upwards ; he was gazing at the ceiling . 
" What the - ? " he muttered . 
Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the Entrance Hall . 
Snape looked round at him , frowning . 
" Did you see anything unusual on your way down here , Potter ? " 
Harry shook his head . 
Somewhere above them , the woman screamed again . 
Snape strode to his office door , his wand still held at the ready , and swept out of sight . 
Harry hesitated for a moment , then followed . 
The screams were indeed coming from the Entrance Hall ; they grew louder as Harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons . 
When he reached the top he found the Entrance Hall packed ; students had come flooding out of the Great Hall , where dinner was still in progress , to see what was going on ; others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase . 
Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring , some of them looking shocked , others even frightened . 
Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the Hall ; she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick . 
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Entrance Hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other , looking utterly mad . 
Her hair was sticking up on end , her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other ; her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders , giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams . 
Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her , one of them upsidedown ; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her . 
Professor Trelawney was staring , apparently terrified , at something Harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs . 
" NO ! 
" Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow's weather , you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections , and lack of any improvement , would make it inevitable that you would be sacked ? " 
" You c - can't ! " howled Professor Trelawney , tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses , " you c - can't sack me ! 
I ' ve b - been here sixteen years ! 
H - Hogwarts is in - my h - home ! " 
" It was your home , " said Professor Umbridge , and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink , sobbing uncontrollably , on to one of her trunks , " until an hour ago , when the Minister of Magic countersigned your Order of Dismissal . 
You are embarrassing us . " 
But she stood and watched , with an expression of gloating enjoyment , as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned , rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief . 
Harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around . 
Lavender and Parvati were both crying quietly , their arms round each other . 
Then he heard footsteps . 
Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators , marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes . 
" There , there , Sibyll … calm down … blow your nose on this … it's not as bad as you think , now … you are not going to have to leave Hogwarts … " 
" Oh really , Professor McGonagall ? " said Umbridge in a deadly voice , taking a few steps forward . 
Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance . 
What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine , but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night . 
Leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney , tear - stained and trembling , on her trunk , Professor McGonagall alongside her . 
" Yours , Professor Dumbledore ? " said Umbridge , with a singularly unpleasant little laugh . 
" I'm afraid you do not understand the position . 
I have here - " she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes " - an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic . 
Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty - three , the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect , place upon probation and sack any teacher she - that is to say , I - feel is not performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic . 
I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch . 
I have dismissed her . " 
To Harry's very great surprise , Dumbledore continued to smile . 
He looked down at Professor Trelawney , who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk , and said , " You are quite right , of course , Professor Umbridge . 
As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers . 
You do not , however , have the authority to send them away from the castle . 
I am afraid , " he went on , with a courteous little bow , " that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster , and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts . " 
I sh - shall - leave Hogwarts and s - seek my fortune elsewhere - " 
" No , " said Dumbledore sharply . 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
" Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs , Professor McGonagall ? " 
" Of course , " said McGonagall . " Up you get , Sibyll … " 
Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney's other arm . 
Together , they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs . 
Professor Trelawney's luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her , Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear . 
Professor Umbridge was standing stock still , staring at Dumbledore , who continued to smile benignly . 
" The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if - and only if - the Headmaster is unable to find one , " said Dumbledore . " And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded . 
May I introduce you ? " 
Harry heard hooves . 
There was a shocked murmur around the Hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards , some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer . 
Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark , dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest : white - blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes ; the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse . 
" I think you ' ll find him suitable . " 
" I ' ll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now , don't you , Hermione ? " 
It was breakfast time , two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney , and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon . 
She turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns . 
" He's not a horse , he's a centaur ! " said Lavender , sounding shocked . 
" How is she ? " asked Harry . 
You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . " 
After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class as Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the Entrance Hall , heading for Divination . 
" Aren't we going up to North Tower ? " asked Ron , looking puzzled , as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase . 
Parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder . 
" How d ' you expect Firenze to climb that ladder ? 
Classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the Entrance Hall from the opposite side to the Great Hall . 
Harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never used regularly , and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom . 
When he entered it right behind Ron , and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing , he was therefore momentarily stunned . 
" What the - ? " 
The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it ; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows , so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft , dappled , green light . 
The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders , arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests , and all looking rather nervous . 
In the middle of the clearing , where there were no trees , stood Firenze . 
" Harry Potter , " he said , holding out a hand when Harry entered . 
" Er - good to see you . " 
As he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground , he saw they were all looking at him in awe , apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze , whom they seemed to find intimidating . 
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket , Firenze gestured around the room . 
" It is not a question of your bravery , " said Firenze , " but of my position . 
I cannot return to the 
" Herd ? " said Lavender in a confused voice , and Harry knew she was thinking of cows . 
Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean , who seemed to realize at once that he had said something very offensive . 
" I didn't - I meant - sorry " he finished in a hushed voice . 
" Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore , " said Firenze . 
Harry remembered how , nearly four years ago , the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety on his back ; he had called him a ' common mule ' . 
He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest . 
He swished his long palomino tail , raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead , then lowered it slowly , and as he did so , the light in the room dimmed , so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight , and stars appeared on the ceiling . 
There were oohs and gasps and Ron said audibly , " Blimey ! " 
" Lie back on the floor , " said Firenze in his calm voice , " and observe the heavens . 
Here is written , for those who can see , the fortune of our races . " 
Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling . 
" I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy , " said Firenze's calm voice , " and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens . 
Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries . 
" These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe , and are unaffected by planetary movements . " 
" - is a human , " said Firenze simply . 
Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati . 
" Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen , I do not know , " continued Firenze , and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them , " but she wastes her time , in the main , on the self - flattering nonsense humans call fortune - telling . 
I , however , am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs , which is impersonal and impartial . 
We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there . 
Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry . 
" In the past decade , the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars . 
How soon , centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves , by the observation of fume and flame … " 
It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended . 
They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor , and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes , but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described , telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this , that it took centaurs years and years to become competent , and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things , anyway , because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly . 
He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had . 
His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew , but rather to impress upon them that nothing , not even centaurs ' knowledge , was foolproof . 
" He's not very definite on anything , is he ? " said Ron in a low voice , as they put out their mallowsweet fire . 
" I mean , I could do with a few more details about this war we ' re about to have , couldn't you ? " 
The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped ; Harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle , and quite convinced that he was really in the Forest . 
Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called , " Harry Potter , a word , please . " 
Harry turned . 
Ron hesitated . 
" Harry Potter , you are a friend of Hagrid's , are you not ? " said the centaur . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
He would do better to abandon it . " 
Harry repeated blankly . 
" I would warn Hagrid myself , but I am banished - it would be unwise for me to go too near the Forest now - Hagrid has troubles enough , without a centaurs ' battle . " 
" But - what's Hagrid attempting to do ? " said Harry nervously . 
Firenze surveyed Harry impassively . 
" Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service , " said Firenze , " and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures . 
I shall not betray his secret . 
The attempt is not working . 
Tell him , Harry Potter . 
Good - day to you . " 
The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated . 
As a dull March blurred into a squally April , his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again . 
At last , Harry had managed it by pretending he'd lost his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , and doubling back after class one day . 
When he'd repeated Firenzes words , Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy , blackened eyes , apparently taken aback . 
" Nice bloke , Firenze , " he said gruffly , " but he don ' know what he's talkin ' abou ' on this . 
The attemp's comin ' on fine . " 
" Because you ' ve got to be careful , Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and , if you ask me , she's on a roll . 
If you ' re doing anything you shouldn't be , you ' ll be - " 
" There's things more importan'than keepin ' a job , " said Hagrid , though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of Knarl droppings crashed to the floor . 
Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor , but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle . 
Meanwhile , as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them , the OWLs were drawing ever nearer . 
All the fifth - years were suffering from stress to some degree , but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now . 
If it had not been for the D . A . lessons , Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy . 
He sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement , working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time , swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow D . A . members and saw how far they had come . 
Indeed , Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the D . A . received ' Outstanding ' in their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWLs . 
" They're not supposed to be pretty , they ' re supposed to protect you , " said Harry patiently . 
" What we really need is a Boggart or something ; that's how I learned , I had to conjure a Patronus while the Boggart was pretending to be a Dementor - " 
" And I still - can't - do it ! " 
" Harry , I think I'm doing it " ' yelled Seamus , who had been brought along to his first ever D . A . meeting by Dean . 
" Look - ah - it's gone … but it was definitely something hairy , Harry ! " 
The door of the Room of Requirement opened , and closed . 
Harry looked round to see who had entered , but there did not seem to be anybody there . 
It was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent . 
Next thing he knew , something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee . 
He looked down and saw , to his very great astonishment , Dobby the house - elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats . 
" What are you - What's wrong ? " 
The members of the D . A . closest to Harry had fallen silent ; everybody in the room was watching Dobby . 
" Harry Potter , sir … " squeaked the elf , trembling from head to foot , " Harry Potter , sir … Dobby has come to warn you … but the house - elves have been warned not to tell … " 
Harry , who had some experience of Dobbys habits of self punishment , made to seize him , but Dobby merely bounced off the stone , cushioned by his eight hats . 
Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy . 
" What's happened , Dobby ? " 
Harry asked , grabbing the elf's tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself . 
" Harry Potter … she … she … " 
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist . 
Harry seized that , too . 
" Umbridge ? " asked Harry , horrified . 
Dobby nodded , then tried to bang his head on Harry's knees . 
Harry held him at arm's length . 
" What about her ? Dobby - she hasn't found out about this - about us - about the D . A . ? " 
He read the answer in the elf's stricken face . 
His hands held fast by Harry , the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor . 
" Is she coming ? " 
Harry asked quietly . 
" Yes , Harry Potter , yes ! " 
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless , terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf . 
Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories . 
It was only ten to nine ; if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery , which were both nearer - 
" Harry , come on ! " shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out . 
He scooped up Dobby , who was still attempting to do himself serious injury , and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue . 
" Dobby - this is an order - get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and , if she asks you whether you warned me , lie and say no ! " said Harry . 
" And I forbid you to hurt yourself ! " he added , dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him . 
Harry glanced left and right , the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished ; he started to run right ; there was a boys ' bathroom up ahead , he could pretend he'd been in there all the time if he could just reach it - 
Someone behind him was laughing . 
He rolled over on to his back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon - shaped vase . 
" Hey Professor - PROFESSOR ! 
I ' ve got one ! " 
" It's him ! " she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor . 
I ' ll take him from here … stand up , Potter ! " 
Harry got to his feet , glaring at the pair of them . 
" Tell the others to look in the library - anybody out of breath - check the bathrooms , Miss Parkinson can do the girls ' ones - off you go - and you , " she added in her softest , most dangerous voice , as Malfoy walked away , " you can come with me to the Headmasters office , Potter . " 
Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught . 
He thought of Ron - Mrs . Weasley would kill him - and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her OWLs . 
" Fizzing Whizzbee , " sang Umbridge ; the stone gargoyle jumped aside , the wall behind split open , and they ascended the moving stone staircase . 
They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker , but Umbridge did not bother to knock , she strode straight inside , still holding tight to Harry . 
The office was full of people . 
Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk , his expression serene , the tips of his long fingers together . 
Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him , her face extremely tense . 
Cornelius Fudge , Minister for Magic , was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire , apparently immensely pleased with the situation ; Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough - looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognize , were positioned on either side of the door like guards , and the freckled , bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall , a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands , apparently poised to take notes . 
All of them were alert and serious , watching what was happening below them . 
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them . 
Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face . 
" Well , " he said . 
Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster . 
" He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower , " said Umbridge . 
There was an indecent excitement in her voice , the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the Entrance Hall . 
" Did he , did he ? " said Fudge appreciatively . 
Well , Potter … I expect you know why you are here ? " 
Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant ' yes ' : his mouth had opened and the word was half - formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore's face . 
Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry - his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder - but as Harry stared at him , he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side . 
" Ye — no . " 
" I beg your pardon ? " said Fudge . 
" No , " said Harry , firmly . 
" No , I don't , " said Harry . 
Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge . 
Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore , who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink . 
" So you have no idea , " said Fudge , in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm , " why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office ? 
You are not aware that you have broken any school rules ? " 
" School rules ? " said Harry . 
" No . " 
" Not that I'm aware of , " said Harry blandly . 
His heart was still hammering very fast . 
It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudges blood pressure rising , but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them ; if somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the D . A . then he , the leader , might as well be packing his trunk right now . 
" Yes , it is , " said Harry , hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face . 
" Yes , yes , do , " said Fudge , nodding , and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room . 
There was a wait of several minutes , in which nobody looked at each other , then Harry heard the door open behind him . 
Umbridge moved past him into the room , gripping by the shoulder Cho's curly - haired friend , Marietta , who was hiding her face in her hands . 
" Don't be scared , dear , don't be frightened , " said Professor Umbridge softly , patting her on the back , " it's quite all right , now . 
You have done the right thing . 
The Minister is very pleased with you . 
" Marietta's mother , Minister , " she added , looking up at Fudge , " is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation , Floo Network office - she's been helping us police the Hogwarts fires , you know . " 
" Jolly good , jolly good ! " said Fudge heartily . 
As Marietta raised her head , Fudge leapt backwards in shock , nearly landing himself in the fire . 
He cursed , and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke . 
Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes , but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close - set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word SNEAK . 
She hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said , " Well , Minister , Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me . 
She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor , sometimes known as the Room of Requirement , I would find out something to my advantage . 
I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there . 
Unfortunately , at that point this hex , " she waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face , " came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more . " 
You did exactly the right thing . 
Now , will you tell me what happened at this meeting ? 
What was its purpose ? 
Who was there ? " 
But Marietta would not speak ; she merely shook her head again , her eyes wide and fearful . 
" You will remember , Minister , that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade - " 
" I have testimony from Willy Widdershins , Minerva , who happened to be in the bar at the time . 
" He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - " 
" Blatant corruption ! " roared the portrait of the corpulent , red - nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk . 
" The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day , no sir , they did not ! " 
" The purpose of Potter's meeting with these students , " continued Professor Umbridge , " was to persuade them to join an illegal society , whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school - age - " 
Harry stared at him . 
He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one ; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it . 
" Oho ! " said Fudge , bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again . 
Or was it Potters identical twin in the Hog's Head that day ? 
Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time , a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors ? " 
" Oh , very good , Minister , very good ! " 
Then he saw , to his astonishment , that Dumbledore was smiling gently , too . 
" Cornelius , I do not deny - and nor , I am sure , does Harry - that he was in the Hog's Head that day , nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group . 
I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was , at that time , illegal . 
If you remember , the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harrys Hogsmeade meeting , so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head . " 
Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy . 
" That's all very fine , Headmaster , " she said , smiling sweetly , " but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty - four . 
" Well , " said Dumbledore , surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers , " they certainly would be , if they had continued after the Decree came into effect . 
Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued ? " 
As Dumbledore spoke , Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something . 
Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here ? " 
" Oh , can she tell us about six months ' worth of meetings ? " said Dumbledore , raising his eyebrows . 
" I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight . " 
" Miss Edgecombe , " said Umbridge at once , " tell us how long these meetings have been going on , dear . 
You can simply nod or shake your head , I'm sure that won't make the spots worse . 
" Just nod or shake your head , dear , " Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta , " come on , now , that won't re - activate the jinx . " 
Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta's face . 
Only her eyes were visible between the pulled - up robes and her curly fringe . 
Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight , but her eyes looked oddly blank . 
And then - to Harry's utter amazement - Marietta shook her head . 
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge , then back at Marietta . 
" I don't think you understood the question , did you , dear ? 
I'm asking whether you ' ve been going to these meetings for the past six months ? 
Again , Marietta shook her head . 
" I would have thought her meaning was quite clear , " said Professor McGonagall harshly , " there have been no secret meetings for the past six months . 
" But there was a meeting tonight ! " said Umbridge furiously . 
" There was a meeting , Miss Edgecombe , you told me about it , in the Room of Requirement ! 
And Potter was the leader , was he not , Potter organized it , Potter - why are you shaking your head , girl ? " 
" Well , usually when a person shakes their head , " said McGonagall coldly , " they mean ' no ' . 
Professor Umbridge seized Marietta , pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard . 
A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet , his wand raised ; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta , waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned . 
" I cannot allow you to manhandle my students , Dolores , " said Dumbledore and , for the first time , he looked angry . 
" You want to calm yourself , Madam Umbridge , " said Kingsley , in his deep , slow voice . 
" I mean , yes - you ' re right , Shacklebolt - I - I forgot myself . " 
She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge's sudden attack , nor relieved by her release ; she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her . 
A sudden suspicion , connected to Kingsley's whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him , sprang into Harry's mind . 
" Dolores , " said Fudge , with the air of trying to settle something once and for all , " the meeting tonight - the one we know definitely happened - " 
" Yes , " said Umbridge , pulling herself together , " yes … well , Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor , accompanied by certain trustworthy students , so as to catch those in the meeting red - handed . 
It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival , however , because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction . 
It does not matter , however . 
I have all their names here , Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind . 
And to Harry's horror , she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement's wall and handed it to Fudge . 
" The moment I saw Potter's name on the list , I knew what we were dealing with , " she said softly . 
He looked up at Dumbledore , who was still standing beside Marietta , his wand held loosely in his hand . 
" Dumbledore's Army . " 
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge . 
He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak . 
Then he looked up , smiling . 
" Well , the game is up , " he said simply . 
" Would you like a written confession from me , Cornelius - or will a statement before these witnesses suffice ? " 
Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other . 
There was fear in both faces . 
He did not understand what was going on , and nor , apparently , did Fudge . 
" Statement ? " said Fudge slowly . 
" What - I don't - ? " 
" Dumbledore's Army , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore , still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge's face . 
Dumbledore's Army . " 
" But - but - " 
He took a horrified step backwards , yelped , and jumped out of the fire again . 
" That's right , " said Dumbledore pleasantly . 
" You organized this ? " 
" I did , " said Dumbledore . 
I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe , of course . " 
Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore , his chest swelling . 
" That's right , " said Dumbledore cheerfully . 
" NO ! " shouted Harry . 
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him , McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly , but it had suddenly dawned on Harry what Dumbledore was about to do , and he could not let it happen . 
" No — Professor Dumbledore - ! " 
" Be quiet , Harry , or I am afraid you will have to leave my office , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" It's like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon , isn't it ? " 
Percy dashed from the room , slamming the door behind him , and Fudge turned back to Dumbledore . 
" You will now be escorted back to the Ministry , where you will be formally charged , then sent to Azkaban to await trial ! " 
" I see no snag , Dumbledore ! " 
" Well , " said Dumbledore apologetically , " I'm afraid I do . " 
" Well - it's just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to - what is the phrase ? 
I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all , Cornelius . 
I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban . 
I could break out , of course - but what a waste of time , and frankly , I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing . " 
Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face , as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened . 
He made a small choking noise , then looked round at Kingsley and the man with short grey hair , who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far . 
The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little , away from the wall . 
Harry saw his hand drift , almost casually , towards his pocket . 
" I'm sure you are an excellent Auror - I seem to remember that you achieved ' Outstanding ' in all your NEWT s — but if you attempt to — er — bring me in by force , I will have to hurt you . " 
He looked towards Fudge again , but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next . 
" Merlin's beard , no , " said Dumbledore , smiling , " not unless you are foolish enough to force me to . " 
Shacklebolt ! 
Take him ! " 
A streak of silver light flashed around the room ; there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled ; a hand grabbed the scruff of Harry's neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off ; several of the portraits yelled , Fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air . 
Coughing in the dust , Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him ; there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried , " No ! " ; then there was the sound of breaking glass , frantically scuffling footsteps , a groan … and silence . 
Harry struggled around to see who was half - strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him ; she had forced both him and Marietta out of harm's way . 
Dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them . 
" Are you all right ? " 
" Yes ! " said Professor McGonagall , getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her . 
The dust was clearing . 
The wreckage of the office loomed into view : Dumbledore's desk had been overturned , all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor , their silver instruments in pieces . 
Fudge , Umbridge , Kingsley and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor . 
" Now , they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate - you must act as though no time has passed , as though they were merely knocked to the ground , they will not remember - " 
" Where will you go , Dumbledore ? " whispered Professor McGonagall . 
" Oh no , " said Dumbledore , with a grim smile , " I am not leaving to go into hiding . 
Fudge will soon wish he'd never dislodged me from Hogwarts , I promise you . " 
" Professor Dumbledore … " Harry began . 
He did not know what to say first : how sorry he was that he had started the D . A . in the first place and caused all this trouble , or how terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion ? 
But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word . 
" Listen to me , Harry , " he said urgently . 
" You must study Occlumency as hard as you can , do you understand me ? 
Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams - you will understand why soon enough , but you must promise me - " 
Dumbledore seized Harry's wrist . 
But as Dumbledore's fingers closed over Harrys skin , a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible , snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore , to bite him , to hurt him - 
" - you will understand , " whispered Dumbledore . 
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him . 
Dumbledore released Harry , raised his hand and grasped the phoenix's long golden tail . 
There was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone . 
" Where is he ? " 
" The stairs ! " cried Dawlish , and he flung himself upon the door , wrenched it open and disappeared , followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge . 
There was a long and painful silence . 
" Well , Minerva , " said Fudge nastily , straightening his torn shirtsleeve , " I'm afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore . " 
" You think so , do you ? " said Professor McGonagall scornfully . 
Fudge seemed not to hear her . 
He was looking around at the wrecked office . 
" You'd better get those two off to bed , " said Fudge , looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod towards Harry and Marietta . 
Professor McGonagall said nothing , but marched Harry and Marietta to the door . 
BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 
Dolores Jane Umbridge ( High Inquisitor ) has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty - eight . 
Signed : Cornelius Oswald Fudge , Minister for Magic 
The notices had gone up all around the school overnight , but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors , the High Inquisitor , the Minister for Magic and his Junior Assistant to escape . 
No matter where Harry went within the castle , the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore's flight , and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling ( Harry overheard one second - year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St . Mungo's with a pumpkin for a head ) it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was . 
Everybody knew , for instance , that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore's office and , as Marietta was now in the hospital wing , Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a first - hand account . 
" Dumbledore will be back before long , " said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology , after listening intently to Harry's story . 
The Fat Friar told me - " he dropped his voice conspiratorially , so that Harry , Ron and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear " - that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they'd searched the castle and grounds for him . 
" Oh , I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Heads office , " said Hermione viciously , as they walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall . 
" Now , do you really want to finish that sentence , Granger ? " 
Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door , closely followed by Crabbe and Goyle . 
His pale , pointed face was alight with malice . 
" Afraid I'm going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff , " he drawled . 
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered . 
" But members of the Inquisitorial Squad - " 
" The what ! " said Hermione sharply . 
" A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic , hand - picked by Professor Umbridge . 
Anyway , members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points … so , Granger , I ' ll have five from you for being rude about our new Headmistress . 
Macmillan , five for contradicting me . 
Five because I don't like you , Potter . 
Weasley , your shirts untucked , so I ' ll have another five for that . 
Oh yeah , I forgot , you ' re a Mudblood , Granger , so ten off for that . " 
Ron pulled out his wand , but Hermione pushed it away , whispering , " Don't ! " 
" New Head , new times … be good now , Potty … Weasel King … " 
Laughing heartily , he strode away with Crabbe and Goyle . 
But Harry , Ron and Hermione had turned automatically towards the giant hour - glasses set in niches along the wall behind them , which recorded the house - points . 
Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning . 
Even as they watched , stones flew upwards , reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs . 
In fact , the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald - filled one of Slytherin . 
" Noticed , have you ? " said Fred's voice . 
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ernie in front of the hour - glasses . 
" Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points , " said Harry furiously , as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour - glass . 
" Yeah , Montague tried to do us during break , " said George . 
" What do you mean , ' tried ' ? " said Ron quickly . 
" He never managed to get all the words out , " said Fred , " due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor . " 
Hermione looked very shocked . 
" But you ' ll get into terrible trouble ! " 
" Have you ever ? " asked Hermione . 
" Course we have , " said George . 
" We ' ve always known where to draw the line , " said Fred . 
" We might have put a toe across it occasionally , " said George . 
" But we ' ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem , " said Fred . 
" But now ? " said Ron tentatively . 
" Well , now - " said George . 
" - what with Dumbledore gone - " said Fred . 
" — is exactly what our dear new Head deserves , " said Fred . 
" You really mustn't ! 
We'd walk out right now if we weren't determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first . 
So , anyway , " he checked his watch , " phase one is about to begin . 
I'd get in the Great Hall for lunch , if I were you , that way the teachers will see you can't have had anything to do with it . " 
" Anything to do with what ? " said Hermione anxiously . 
" You ' ll see , " said George . 
Fred and George turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch . 
" I think we should get out of here , you know , " said Hermione nervously . 
" Yeah , all right , " said Ron , and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall , but Harry had barely glimpsed the day's ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and , turning , he found himself almost nose - to - nose with Filch the caretaker . 
" I didn't do it , " said Harry stupidly , thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning . 
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione , who were both looking worried . 
He shrugged , and followed Filch back into the Entrance Hall , against the tide of hungry students . 
As they reached the first landing he said , " Things are changing around here , Potter . " 
" I ' ve noticed , " said Harry coldly . 
" Yerse … I ' ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he's too soft with you all , " said Filch , chuckling nastily . 
Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could ' ve strung you up by the ankles in my office , would they ? 
But when Educational Decree Number Twenty - nine comes in , Potter , I ' ll be allowed to do them things … and she's asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves … oh , things are going to be very different around here with her in charge . " 
Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side , Harry thought , and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon ; his knowledge of the school's secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the Weasley twins . 
" Here we are , " he said , leering down at Harry as he rapped three times on Professor Umbridge's door and pushed it open . 
" The Potter boy to see you , Ma ' am . " 
Umbridge's office , so very familiar to Harry from his many detentions , was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word : HEADMISTRESS . 
Also , his Firebolt and Fred and George's Cleansweeps , which he saw with a pang , were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk . 
Umbridge was sitting behind the desk , busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment , but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance . 
" Thank you , Argus , " she said sweetly . 
" Sit , " said Umbridge curtly , pointing towards a chair . 
Harry sat . 
He watched some of the foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head , wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him . 
" Well , now , " she said finally , setting down her quill and surveying him complacently , like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly . 
" What would you like to drink ? " 
" What ? " said Harry , quite sure he had misheard her . 
" To drink , Mr . Potter , " she said , smiling still more widely . 
" Tea ? 
Coffee ? 
Pumpkin juice ? " 
As she named each drink , she gave her short wand a wave , and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk . 
" Nothing , thank you , " said Harry . 
" I wish you to have a drink with me , " she said , her voice becoming dangerously sweet . 
" Fine … tea then , " said Harry , shrugging . 
She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him . 
" There , " she said , handing it to him . 
" Drink it before it gets cold , won't you ? 
Well , now , Mr . Potter … I thought we ought to have a little chat , after the distressing events of last night . " 
He said nothing . 
She settled herself back into her seat and waited . 
He raised the cup to his lips and then , just as suddenly , lowered it . 
One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad - Eye Moody's magical one and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad - Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy . 
" What's the matter ? " said Umbridge , who was still watching him closely . 
" Do you want sugar ? " 
" No , " said Harry . 
He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip , though keeping his mouth tightly closed . 
Umbridge's smile widened . 
" Good , " she whispered . 
" Very good . 
Now then … " She leaned forwards a little . 
" Where is Albus 
Dumbledore ? " 
" No idea , " said Harry promptly . 
" Drink up , drink up , " she said , still smiling . 
" Now , Mr . Potter , let us not play childish games . 
I know that you know where he has gone . 
You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning . 
Consider your position , Mr . Potter … " 
" I don't know where he is , " Harry repeated . 
She was watching him very closely . 
" Very well , " she said , though she looked displeased . 
" In that case , you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black . " 
He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together , so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes . 
" I don't know , " he said , a little too quickly . 
Potter , " said Umbridge , " let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October . 
I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today , I promise you . 
I repeat , Mr . Potter … where is Sirius Black ? " 
" No idea , " said Harry loudly . 
They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering . 
Then Umbridge stood up . 
" Very well , Potter , I will take your word for it this time , but be warned : the might of the Ministry stands behind me . 
All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored . 
And Mr . Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle . 
If I find a shred of evidence … " 
BOOM ! 
The very floor of the office shook . 
" What was - ? " 
She was gazing towards the door . 
Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost - full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers . 
He could hear people running and screaming several floors below . 
" Back to lunch you go , Potter ! " cried Umbridge , raising her wand and dashing out of the office . 
Harry gave her a few seconds'start , then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was . 
It was not difficult to find . 
Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors , emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went ; shocking - pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers ; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls ; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord ; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked , and instead of burning themselves out , fading from sight or fizzling to a halt , these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched . 
Filch and Umbridge were standing , apparently transfixed in horror , halfway down the stairs . 
As Harry watched , one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver ; it whirled towards Umbridge and Filch with a sinister ' wheeeeeeeeee ' . 
They both yelled with fright and ducked , and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds . 
Meanwhile , several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor . 
" Hurry , Filch , hurry ! " shrieked Umbridge , " they ' ll be all over the school unless we do something - Stupefy " 
A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets . 
Instead of freezing in midair , it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy - looking witch in the middle of a meadow ; she ran for it just in time , reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting , where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her . 
He dashed to a nearby cupboard , pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair ; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze . 
Harry had seen enough ; laughing , he ducked down low , ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it , listening to Umbridge and Filch's yells and quaking with suppressed mirth . 
" Impressive , " Harry said quietly , grinning . 
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon . 
Though they caused plenty of disruption , particularly the firecrackers , the other teachers didn't seem to mind them very much . 
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as Headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers , none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her . 
When the final bell rang and they were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags , Harry saw , with immense satisfaction , a disheveled and soot - blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty - faced from Professor Flitwick's classroom . 
" Thank you so much , Professor ! " said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice . 
" I could have got rid of the sparklers myself , of course , but I wasn't sure whether or not I had the authority . " 
Beaming , he closed his classroom door in her snarling face . 
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room . 
Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them . 
Only thing is , we used our whole stock ; we ' re going to have to start again from scratch now . " 
" If you want to add your name to the waiting list , Hermione , it's five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe … " 
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself . 
" Oh , why don't we have a night off ? " said Hermione brightly , as a silver - tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window . 
" Are you feeling all right ? " 
Ron asked , staring at her in disbelief . 
" Now you mention it , " said Hermione happily , " d ' you know … I think I'm feeling a bit … rebellious . " 
Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour later ; and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower , still resolutely spelling out the word TOO . 
With his glasses off , the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred , looking like sparkling clouds , beautiful and mysterious against the black sky . 
He turned on to his side , wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledore's job , and how Fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption . 
Smiling to himself , Harry closed his eyes … 
He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries . 
He was speeding towards the plain black door … let it open … let it open … 
It did . 
He was inside the circular room lined with doors … he crossed it , placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards … 
Now he was in a long , rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking . 
There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate … he had to go on … 
There was a door at the far end … it , too , opened at his touch … 
And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church , full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves , each laden with small , dusty , spun - glass spheres … now Harrys heart was beating fast with excitement … he knew where to go … he ran forwards , but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous , deserted room … 
There was something in this room he wanted very , very much … 
His scar was hurting … 
BANG ! 
Harry awoke instantly , confused and angry . 
The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter . 
Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look . 
Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower . 
Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them . 
His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening . 
Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream . 
With a surge of guilt he realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson : there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left ; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried . 
He attempted a little last - minute practice during classes that day , but it was no good . 
Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and , after all , the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class . 
Resigned to the worst , he set off for Snape's office after dinner . 
" Over here , " said Harry , glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape , and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour - glasses stood . 
Gryffindor's was now almost empty . 
" Are you okay ? 
" Oh , no , " said Cho hurriedly . 
" No , it was only … well , I just wanted to say … Harry , I never dreamed Marietta would tell … " 
" Yeah , well , " said Harry moodily . 
He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully ; it was small consolation that the last he had heard , Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples . 
" She's a lovely person really , " said Cho . " She just made a mistake - " 
Harry looked at her incredulously . 
" A lovely person who made a mistake ? 
She sold us all out , including you ! " 
" You know , her mum works for the Ministry , it's really difficult for her - " 
Harry said furiously . 
" That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's , " said Cho fiercely . 
" I think it was a brilliant idea , " said Harry coldly . 
Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter . 
" Oh yes , I forgot - of course , if it was darling Hermione's idea - " 
Fuming , Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon and , though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful , he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door . 
" You ' re late , Potter , " said Snape coldly , as Harry closed the door behind him . 
Snape was standing with his back to Harry , removing , as usual , certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledores Pensieve . 
He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry . 
" So , " he said . 
" Have you been practicing ? " 
" Yes , " Harry lied , looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape's desk . 
" Well , we ' ll soon find out , won't we ? " said Snape smoothly . 
" Wand out , Potter . " 
Harry moved into his usual position , facing Snape with the desk between them . 
His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind . 
" One - two - " 
Snape's office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in . 
" Professor Snape , sir - oh - sorry - " 
Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise . 
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid . 
" I didn't know , " he said , leering at Harry , who knew his face was burning . 
He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy - or , even better , to hit him with a good curse . 
" Well , Draco , what is it ? " 
asked Snape . 
" It's Professor Umbridge , sir - she needs your help , " said Malfoy . 
" They ' ve found Montague , sir , he's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor . " 
" How did he get in there ? " demanded Snape . 
Potter , " said Snape , " we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening . " 
He turned and swept from his office . 
Malfoy mouthed , " Remedial Potions ? " at Harry behind Snape's back before following him . 
Seething , Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room . 
At least he had twenty - four more hours in which to practice ; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape , though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial Potions . 
He was at the office door when he saw it : a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe . 
He stopped , and stood looking at it , reminded of something … then he remembered : it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night , the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries . 
He turned around . 
The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk . 
Snape's thoughts … things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's Defenses accidentally … 
Harry gazed at the Pensieve , curiosity welling inside him … what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry ? 
The silvery lights shivered on the wall … Harry took two steps towards the desk , thinking hard . 
Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him ? 
Harry looked over his shoulder , his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever . 
How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet ? 
Would he come straight back to his office afterwards , or accompany Montague to the hospital wing ? 
Surely the latter … Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team , Snape would want to make sure he was all right . 
Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it , gazing into its depths . 
The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent . 
He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand . 
Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent . 
He was , once again , looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling … in fact , unless he was much mistaken , he was looking down into the Great Hall . 
His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts … his brain seemed to be in limbo … it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do … he was trembling … Snape could be back at any moment … but Harry thought of Cho's anger , of Malfoy's jeering face , and a reckless daring seized him . 
He took a great gulp of breath , and plunged his face into the surface of Snape's thoughts . 
At once , the floor of the office lurched , tipping Harry head - first into the Pensieve … 
He was falling through cold blackness , spinning furiously as he went , and then - 
He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall , but the four house tables were gone . 
Instead , there were more than a hundred smaller tables , all facing the same way , at each of which sat a student , head bent low , scribbling on a roll of parchment . 
The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment . 
Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads , which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light . 
Harry looked around carefully . 
Snape had to be here somewhere … this was his memory … 
And there he was , at a table right behind Harry . 
Harry stared . 
Snape - the - teenager had a stringy , pallid look about him , like a plant kept in the dark . 
His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table , his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled . 
Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper : DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS - ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL . 
His hand was flying across the parchment ; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbors , and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped . 
" Five more minutes ! " 
The voice made Harry jump . 
Turning , he saw the top of Professor Flitwick's head moving between the desks a short distance away . 
Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair … very untidy black hair … 
The back of the black - haired boy's head drew nearer and … he was straightening up now , putting down his quill , pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written … 
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen - year - old father . 
Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach : it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes . 
James's eyes were hazel , his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead , but they had the same thin face , same mouth , same eyebrows ; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did , his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that , when James stood up , they would be within an inch of each other in height . 
Then , with a glance towards Professor Flitwick , he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him . 
Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease , tilting it back on two legs . 
He was very good - looking ; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved , and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully , though he didn't seem to have noticed . 
And two seats along from this girl - Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm - was Remus Lupin . 
He looked rather pale and peaky ( was the full moon approaching ? ) and was absorbed in the exam : as he reread his answers , he scratched his chin with the end of his quill , frowning slightly . 
Wormtail looked anxious ; he was chewing his fingernails , staring down at his paper , scuffing the ground with his toes . 
Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment , then back at James , who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment . 
He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L . E . 
" Quills down , please ! " squeaked Professor Flitwick . 
Accio ! " 
Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick's outstretched arms , knocking him backwards off his feet . 
A couple of students at the front desks got up , took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet . 
" Thank you … thank you , " panted Professor Flitwick . 
Harry looked down at his father , who had hastily crossed out the L . E . he had been embellishing , jumped to his feet , stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag , which he slung over his back , and stood waiting for Sirius to join him . 
Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away , moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall , still absorbed in his own exam paper . 
Round - shouldered yet angular , he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider , and his oily hair was jumping about his face . 
A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James , Sirius and Lupin , and by planting himself in their midst , Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends . 
" Did you like question ten , Moony ? " asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall . 
" Give five signs that identify the werewolf . 
" D ' you think you managed to get all the signs ? " said James in tones of mock concern . 
" Think I did , " said Lupin seriously , as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds . 
" I got the snout shape , the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail , ' he said anxiously , " but I couldn't think what else - " 
" How thick are you , Wormtail ? " said James impatiently . 
" You run round with a werewolf once a month - " 
Harry looked anxiously behind him again . 
Snape remained close by , still buried in his exam questions - but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds , he , Harry , would not be able to follow James any further . 
To his intense relief , however , when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake , Snape followed , still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going . 
By keeping a little ahead of him , Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others . 
" Well , I thought that paper was a piece of cake , " he heard Sirius say . 
" I ' ll be surprised if I don't get ' Outstanding ' on it at least . " 
" Me too , " said James . 
He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch . 
He started playing with the Snitch , allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again ; his reflexes were excellent . 
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry , Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework , and threw themselves down on the grass . 
Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw , to his delight , that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes . 
He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever , which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree . 
The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake , on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting , with their shoes and socks off , cooling their feet in the water . 
Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass , looking rather haughty and bored , but very handsomely so . 
James was still playing with the Snitch , letting it zoom further and further away , almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second . 
Every time James made a particularly difficult catch , Wormtail gasped and applauded . 
Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy , and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water's edge . 
" If it bothers you , " he said , stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket . 
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off . 
" I'm bored , " said Sirius . 
" We ' ve still got Transfiguration , if you ' re bored you could test me . 
But Sirius snorted . 
" I don't need to look at that rubbish , I know it all . " 
" This ' ll liven you up , Padfoot , " said James quietly . 
" Look who it is … " 
Sirius's head turned . 
He became very still , like a dog that has scented a rabbit . 
" Excellent , " he said softly . 
Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at . 
Snape was on his feet again , and was stowing the OWL paper in his bag . 
As he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass , Sirius and James stood up . 
Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting : Lupin was still staring down at his book , though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows ; Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face . 
" All right , Snivellus ? " said James loudly . 
Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack : dropping his bag , he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted , " Expelliarmus ! " 
Snape's wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him . 
" Impedimenta ! " he said , pointing his wand at Snape , who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand . 
Students all around had turned to watch . 
Snape lay panting on the ground . 
James and Sirius advanced on him , wands raised , James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water's edge as he went . 
" How'd the exam go , Snivelly ? " said James . 
" I was watching him , his nose was touching the parchment , " said Sirius viciously . 
" There ' ll be great grease marks all over it , they won't be able to read a word . " 
Snape was trying to get up , but the jinx was still operating on him ; he was struggling , as though bound by invisible ropes . 
" You - wait , " he panted , staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing , " you - wait ! " 
" What ' re you going to do , Snivelly , wipe your nose on us ? " 
Snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes , but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened . 
" Wash out your mouth , " said James coldly . 
" Scourgify ! " 
Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape's mouth at once ; the froth was covering his lips , making him gag , choking him - 
" Leave him ALONE ! " 
James and Sirius looked round . 
James's free hand immediately jumped to his hair . 
It was one of the girls from the lake edge . 
She had thick , dark red hair that fell to her shoulders , and startlingly green almond - shaped eyes - Harry's eyes . 
Harry's mother . 
" All right , Evans ? " said James , and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant , deeper , more mature . 
" Leave him alone , " Lily repeated . 
" What's he done to you ? " 
" Well , " said James , appearing to deliberate the point , " it's more the fact that he exists , if you know what I mean … " 
" You think you ' re funny , " she said coldly . 
Leave him alone . " 
" I will if you go out with me , Evans , " said James quickly . 
" Go on … go out with me and I ' ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again . " 
" I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid , " said Lily . 
" Bad luck , Prongs , " said Sirius briskly , and turned back to Snape . 
But too late ; Snape had directed his wand straight at James ; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face , spattering his robes with blood . 
James whirled about : a second flash of light later , Snape was hanging upside - down in the air , his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny , pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants . 
Many people in the small crowd cheered ; Sirius , James and Wormtail roared with laughter . 
Lily , whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile , said , " Let him down ! " 
" Certainly , " said James and he jerked his wand upwards ; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground . 
Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet , wand up , but Sirius said , " Locomotor mortis ! " and Snape keeled over again at once , rigid as a board . 
She had her own wand out now . 
James and Sirius eyed it warily . 
" Ah , Evans , don't make me hex you , " said James earnestly . 
" Take the curse off him , then ! " 
James sighed deeply , then turned to Snape and muttered the counter - curse . 
" You ' re lucky Evans was here , Snivellus — " 
" I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her ! " 
Lily blinked . 
" Fine , " she said coolly . 
And I'd wash your pants if I were you , Snivellus . " 
" Apologize to Evans ! " James roared at Snape , his wand pointed threateningly at him . 
" I don't want you to make him apologize , " Lily shouted , rounding on James . 
" You ' re as bad as he is . " 
" What ? " yelped James . 
" I'd NEVER call you a - you - know - what ! " 
" Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you ' ve just got off your broomstick , showing off with that stupid Snitch , walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can - I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it . 
You make me SICK . " 
She turned on her heel and hurried away . 
" Hey , EVANS ! " 
But she didn't look back . 
" What is it with her ? " said James , trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him . 
" Right , " said James , who looked furious now , " right - " 
There was another flash of light , and Snape was once again hanging upside - down in the air . 
" Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants ? " 
But whether James really did take off Snapes pants , Harry never found out . 
Wincing , Harry looked round to see who had hold of him , and saw , with a thrill of horror , a fully grown , adult - sized Snape standing right beside him , white with rage . 
Harry felt himself rising into the air ; the summer's day evaporated around him ; he was floating upwards through icy blackness , Snape's hand still tight upon his upper arm . 
Then , with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head - over - heels in midair , his feet hit the stone floor of Snape's dungeon and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape's desk in the shadowy , present - day Potion masters study . 
" So , " said Snape , gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb . 
" N - no , " said Harry , trying to free his arm . 
It was scary : Snape's lips were shaking , his face was white , his teeth were bared . 
" Amusing man , your father , wasn't he ? " said Snape , shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose . 
Snape threw Harry from him with all his might . 
Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor . 
" You will not repeat what you saw to anybody ! " Snape bellowed . 
" No , of course I w — " 
" Get out , get out , I don't want to see you in this office ever again ! " 
And as Harry hurtled towards the door , a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head . 
He wrenched the door open and flew along the corridor , stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and Snape . 
There he leaned against the wall , panting , and rubbing his bruised arm . 
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early , nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen . 
What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him ; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers , knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him , and that judging from what he had just seen , his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him . 
" I ' ve told you , " Harry muttered . 
" Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I ' ve got the basics . " 
" Pretty much , " said Harry , not looking at her . 
" Well , I don't think Snape should stop until you ' re absolutely sure you can control them ! " said Hermione indignantly . 
" Harry , I think you should go back to him and ask - " 
" No , " said Harry forcefully . 
It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione , as was her custom , had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedule for the three of them . 
Harry and Ron had let her do it ; it was easier than arguing with her and , in any case , they might come in useful . 
" Well , there you are , " she said , handing him his timetable , " if you follow that you should do fine . " 
Ron looked down it gloomily , but then brightened . 
" That's for Quidditch practice , " said Hermione . 
The smile faded from Ron's face . 
" What's the point ? " he said dully . 
" We ' ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic . " 
Hermione said nothing ; she was looking at Harry , who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand , trying to get his ears scratched . 
" What's wrong , Harry ? " 
" What ? " he said quickly . 
" Nothing . " 
" I saw Cho earlier , " said Hermione tentatively . 
" Wha — oh , yeah , we have , " said Harry , seizing gratefully on the excuse . 
" What about ? " 
" That sneak friend of hers , Marietta , " said Harry . 
Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe , which Harry found helpful ; all he had to do was look angry , nod and say " Yeah " and " That's right " whenever Ron drew breath , leaving his mind free to dwell , ever more miserably , on what he had seen in the Pensieve . 
He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside . 
He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character . 
( Yeah , well , look what Sirius was like himself , said a nagging voice inside Harry's head … he was as bad , wasn't he ? ) Yes , he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school , but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins , and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside - down for the fun of it … not unless they really loathed them … perhaps Malfoy , or somebody who really deserved it … 
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands : but hadn't Lily asked , " What's he done to you ? " 
Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius … but in the Pensieve , he had sat there and let it all happen … 
Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it … 
For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort , of inspiration . 
And now … now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him . 
The weather grew breezier , brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed , but Harry , along with the rest of the fifth - and seventh - years , was trapped inside , traipsing back and forth to the library . 
Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams , and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves , his excuse went unchallenged . 
" Harry , I'm talking to you , can you hear me ? " 
" Huh ? " 
He looked round . 
It was late on Sunday evening : Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes , and Ron had Quidditch practice . 
" Oh , hi , " said Harry , pulling his books towards him . 
" It's over , " said Ginny . 
" Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing . " 
" Why ? " 
" Anyway … a package just arrived , it's only just got through Umbridge's new screening process . " 
She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table ; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re - wrapped . 
There was a scribbled note across it in red ink , reading : Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor . 
" It's Easter eggs from Mum , " said Ginny . 
" There's one for you … there you go . " 
She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small , iced Snitches and , according to the packaging , containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees . 
Harry looked at it for a moment , then , to his horror , felt a lump rise in his throat . 
" Are you okay , Harry ? " Ginny asked quietly . 
" Yeah , I'm fine , " said Harry gruffly . 
" You know , I'm sure if you just talked to Cho … " 
" It's not Cho I want to talk to , " said Harry brusquely . 
" I … " 
He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening . 
Madam Pince was several shelves away , stamping out a pile of books for a frantic - looking Hannah Abbott . 
" I wish I could talk to Sirius , " he muttered . 
" But I know I can't . " 
" Well , " said Ginny slowly , helping herself to a bit of egg , too , " if you really want to talk to Sirius , I expect we could think of a way to do it . " 
" Come on , " said Harry dully . 
" The thing about growing up with Fred and George , " said Ginny thoughtfully , " is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you ' ve got enough nerve . " 
Harry looked at her . 
Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate - Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with Dementors - or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week , but he felt a bit more hopeful . 
" WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING ? " 
" Chocolate in the library ! " she screamed . 
" Out - out - OUT ! " And whipping out her wand , she caused Harry's books , bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library , whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran . 
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations , a batch of pamphlets , leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays , along with yet another notice on the board , which read : 
All fifth - years are required to attend a short meeting with their Head of House during the first week of the summer term to discuss their future careers . 
Times of individual appointments are listed below . 
Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half past two on Monday , which would mean missing most of Divination . 
He and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal . 
" Well , I don't fancy Healing , " said Ron on the last evening of the holidays . 
He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone - and - wand emblem of St . Mungo's on its front . 
" Well , it's a very responsible job , isn't it ? " said Hermione absently . 
" You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles ; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies : ' Much more important is your enthusiasm , patience and a good sense of fun ! ' " 
" Listen to this : Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel , adventure and substantial , danger - related treasure bonuses ? 
Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank , who are currently recruiting Curse - Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad … They want Arithmancy , though ; you could do it , Hermione ! " 
" Hey , " said a voice in Harry's ear . 
" Ginnys had a word with us about you , " said Fred , stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor . 
" She says you need to talk to Sirius ? " 
" Yeah … " said Harry , trying to sound casual , " yeah , I thought I'd like - " 
" Don't be so ridiculous , " said Hermione , straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes . 
" With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls ? " 
" Well , we think we can find a way around that , " said George , stretching and smiling . 
" It's a simple matter of causing a diversion . 
And of course , we'd have messed up people's studying , too , which would be the very last thing we'd want to do . " 
He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod . 
" And if we ' re going to be causing a bit of uproar , why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius ? " 
" Umbridge's office , " said Harry quietly . 
Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own . 
" Are - you - insane ? " said Hermione in a hushed voice . 
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily . 
" I don't think so , " said Harry , shrugging . 
" And how are you going to get in there in the first place ? " 
" Sirius's knife , " he said . 
" So even if she's bewitched the door so Alohomora won't work , which I bet she has - " 
" What do you think about this ? " Hermione demanded of Ron , and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs . Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place . 
" If Harry wants to do it , it's up to him , isn't it ? " 
" Spoken like a true friend and Weasley , " said Fred , clapping Ron hard on the back . 
" Right , then . 
We're thinking of doing it tomorrow , just after lessons , because it should cause maximum impact if everybody's in the corridors - Harry , we ' ll set it off in the east wing somewhere , draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we should be able to guarantee you , what , twenty minutes ? " he said , looking at George . 
" Easy , " said George . 
" What sort of diversion is it ? " 
asked Ron . 
Harry awoke very early the next day , feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic . 
It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous , though that was certainly bad enough ; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office . 
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead , Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed , and stared out on a truly glorious morning . 
The sky was a clear , misty , opalescent blue . 
Directly ahead of him , Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape . 
He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve , but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened , to know of any mitigating factors there might have been , any excuse at all for his father's behavior … 
Something caught Harry's attention : movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees . 
He seemed to be limping . 
As Harry watched , Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it . 
Hagrid did not emerge again , but smoke furled from the chimney , so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire . 
Harry turned away from the window , headed back to his trunk and started to dress . 
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead , Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one , but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o ' clock . 
For the first time ever , she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were , keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore . 
" … and if she does catch you there , apart from being expelled , she ' ll be able to guess you ' ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she ' ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions … " 
" Hermione , " said Ron in a low and indignant voice , " are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns , or am I going to have to take my own notes ? " 
By the time they reached the dungeons , neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione . 
Snape , meanwhile , seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible . 
Harry was , of course , well - used to this tactic , as it was one of Uncle Vernon's favorites , and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse . 
In fact , compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks , he found the new approach something of an improvement , and was pleased to find that when left well alone , he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily . 
At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask , corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking , feeling that he might at last have scraped an E . 
He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise . 
Harry whipped around . 
His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure . 
" Whoops , " he said softly . 
He strode back to his cauldron , intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it , but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished . 
" I'm sorry ! " said Hermione , with her hands over her mouth . 
" I'm really sorry , Harry . 
I thought you'd finished , so I cleared up ! " 
Harry could not bring himself to answer . 
When the bell rang , he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance , and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office . 
He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath , only a few minutes late . 
" Sorry , Professor , " he panted , as he closed the door . 
" I forgot . " 
" No matter , Potter , " she said briskly , but as she spoke , somebody else sniffed from the corner . 
Harry looked round . 
Professor Umbridge was sitting there , a clipboard on her knee , a fussy little pie - frill around her neck and a small , horribly smug smile on her face . 
" Sit down , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall tersely . 
Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk . 
Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard . 
" Well , Potter , this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have , and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts ? " 
" Er - " said Harry . 
" Yes ? " Professor McGonagall prompted Harry . 
" You'd need top grades for that , " said Professor McGonagall , extracting a small , dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it . 
Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office . 
In fact , I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years . " 
At this moment , Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough , as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it . 
Professor McGonagall ignored her . 
" You ' ll want to know which subjects you ought to take , I suppose ? " she went on , talking a little louder than before . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Naturally , " said Professor McGonagall crisply . 
" I would also advise - " 
Professor Umbridge gave another cough , a little more audible this time . 
Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment , opened them again , and continued as though nothing had happened . 
I'd say you ' re averaging ' Acceptable ' at the moment , so you ' ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing . 
Yes , Potter , Potions , " she added , with the merest flicker of a smile . 
" May I offer you a cough drop , Dolores ? " Professor McGonagall asked curtly , without looking at Professor Umbridge . 
" Oh , no , thank you very much , " said Umbridge , with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much . 
" I daresay you ' ll find you can , " said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth . 
" I was just wondering whether Mr . Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror ? " said Professor Umbridge sweetly . 
" Were you ? " said Professor McGonagall haughtily . 
I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ' Acceptable ' and ' Exceeds Expectations ' for the last two years , so your Charmwork seems satisfactory . 
" I was just concerned that you might not have Harrys most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you . 
I'm quite sure I slipped in a note . " 
" What , this thing ? " said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion , as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder . 
She glanced down it , her eyebrows slightly raised , then placed it back into the folder without comment . 
" Of course I understood it , " said Professor McGonagall , her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled . 
" Well , then , I am confused … I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr . Potter false hope that - " 
" False hope ? " repeated Professor McGonagall , still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge . 
" I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you , Minerva , but as you will see from my note , Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - " 
" I should have made my meaning plainer , " said Professor McGonagall , turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes . 
Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing . 
She sat back in her chair , turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed , her bulging eyes rolling from side to side . 
Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry , her thin nostrils flared , her eyes burning . 
" Any questions , Potter ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you , if you get enough NEWTs ? " 
" Well , you ' ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth , " said Professor McGonagall , " perseverance and dedication , because Auror training takes a further three years , not to mention very high skills in practical Defense . 
It will mean a lot more study even after you ' ve left school , so unless you ' re prepared to - " 
" I think you ' ll also find , " said Umbridge , her voice very cold now , " that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors . 
" - unless you ' re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts , you should really look at another - " 
" Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school . " 
" A very good chance , then , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Potter has a criminal record , " said Umbridge loudly . 
Professor Umbridge stood up . 
She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference , but her fussy , simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad , flabby face look oddly sinister . 
Professor McGonagall got to her feet , too , and in her case this was a much more impressive move ; she towered over Professor Umbridge . 
" Potter , " she said in ringing tones , " I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do ! 
If I have to coach you nightly , I will make sure you achieve the required results ! " 
" The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter ! " said Umbridge , her voice rising furiously . 
" Yes ! 
Yes , yes , yes ! 
Of course ! 
That's what you want , isn't it , Minerva McGonagall ? 
You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore ! 
You think you ' ll be where I am , don't you : Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot ! " 
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room , not daring to look at Professor Umbridge . 
He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor . 
Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon . 
" I hope you ' ve thought better of what you were planning to do , Harry , " Hermione whispered , the moment they had opened their books to ' Chapter Thirty - four , Non - Retaliation and Negotiation ' . 
Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry , who kept his head down , staring at Defensive Magical Theory , his eyes unfocused , thinking … 
He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him … there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve … nothing , except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach … and then there was the matter of Fred and George , whose diversion was already planned , not to mention the knife Sirius had given him , which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak . 
But the fact remained that if he was caught … 
He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago … 
And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room … 
But did he want to be like his father any more ? 
Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class . 
He did not answer ; he did not know what to do . 
Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice ; he would not look at Harry , though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more , he said in a low voice , " Give it a rest , okay ? 
He can make up his own mind . " 
Harrys heart beat very fast as he left the classroom . 
He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance . 
There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them ; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - 
Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her . 
Pulling out her wand , she hurried off in the opposite direction : it was now or never . 
" Harry - please ! " Hermione pleaded weakly . 
But he had made up his mind ; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder , he set off at a run , weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing . 
Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted . 
Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him , he pulled open his bag , seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak . 
He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door . 
He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down , then withdrew it . 
There was a tiny click , and the door swung open . 
He ducked inside the office , closed the door quickly behind him and looked around . 
Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks . 
Harry pulled off his Cloak and , striding over to the fireplace , found what he was looking for within seconds : a small box containing glittering Floo powder . 
He crouched down in front of the empty grate , his hands shaking . 
He had never done this before , though he thought he knew how it must work . 
Sticking his head into the fireplace , he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him . 
Harry said loudly and clearly . 
It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced . 
He had traveled by Floo powder before , of course , but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country . 
This time , his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge's office , and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire … 
And then , as abruptly as it had begun , the spinning stopped . 
Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head , Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long , wooden table , where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment . 
" Sirius ? " 
The man jumped and looked around . 
It was not Sirius , but Lupin . 
" Harry ! " he said , looking thoroughly shocked . 
" What are you - what's happened , is everything all right ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" I just wondered — I mean , I just fancied a - a chat with Sirius . " 
" I ' ll call him , " said Lupin , getting to his feet , still looking perplexed , " he went upstairs to look for Kreacher , he seems to be hiding in the attic again … " 
And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen . 
Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs . 
Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later . 
" What is it ? " said Sirius urgently , sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire , so that he and Harry were on a level . 
" Are you all right ? 
Do you need help ? " 
" No , " said Harry , " it's nothing like that … I just wanted to talk … about my dad . " 
They exchanged a look of great surprise , but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed ; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion ; George had only guaranteed him twenty . 
He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve . 
When he had finished , neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment . 
Then Lupin said quietly , " I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there , Harry . 
" I'm fifteen ! " said Harry heatedly . 
" Look , Harry " said Sirius placatingly , " James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other , it was just one of those things , you can understand that , can't you ? 
And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts , and James - whatever else he may have appeared to you , Harry - always hated the Dark Arts . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry , " but he just attacked Snape for no good reason , just because - well , just because you said you were bored , " he finished , with a slightly apologetic note in his voice . 
" I'm not proud of it , " said Sirius quickly . 
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius , then said , " Look , Harry , what you ' ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - " 
" If we were sometimes arrogant little berks , you mean , " said Sirius . 
Lupin smiled . 
" He kept messing up his hair , " said Harry in a pained voice . 
Sirius and Lupin laughed . 
" I'd forgotten he used to do that , " said Sirius affectionately . 
" Well … I thought he was a bit of an idiot . " 
" Of course he was a bit of an idiot ! " said Sirius bracingly , " we were all idiots ! 
Well - not Moony so much , " he said fairly , looking at Lupin . 
" Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape ? " he said . 
" Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order ? " 
" Yeah , well , " said Sirius , " you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes … that was something … " 
" And , " said Harry doggedly , determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here , " he kept looking over at the girls by the lake , hoping they were watching him ! " 
Harry asked miserably . 
" She started going out with him in seventh year , " said Lupin . 
" Once James had deflated his head a bit , " said Sirius . 
" And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it , " said Lupin . 
" Even Snape ? " said Harry . 
" Well , " said Lupin slowly , " Snape was a special case I mean , he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down , could you ? " 
Sirius frowned at Harry , who was still looking unconvinced . 
" Look , " he said , " your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person . 
A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen . 
He grew out of it . " 
" Yeah , okay , " said Harry heavily . 
" I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape . " 
" Are you serious , Harry ? " said Lupin quickly . 
" But it's okay , I don't care , it's a bit of a relief to tell you the - " 
" If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me ! " he said firmly . 
" But Harry , first of all , you ' re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears - " 
" Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency ! " said Lupin sternly . 
" Do you understand me ? 
Nothing ! " 
" I ' ll … I ' ll try and say something to him … but it won't be - " 
He fell silent . 
He could hear distant footsteps . 
" No , " said Sirius , glancing behind him . 
" It must be somebody your end . " 
" I'd better go ! " he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire . 
For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders , then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die . 
" Quickly , quickly ! " he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door . 
" Ah , she's left it open - " 
Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office . 
He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room , pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it . 
He pulled out a piece of parchment , kissed it , then shuffled rapidly back out of the door , clutching it to his chest . 
Harry leapt to his feet and , making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him , he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch , who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go . 
One landing down from Umbridge's office , Harry thought it was safe to become visible again . 
He pulled off the Cloak , shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards . 
There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall . 
He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there . 
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked . 
Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring ( some of them , Harry noticed , covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap ) ; teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd . 
Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad , who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves , and Peeves , who was bobbing overhead , gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered . 
" So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp , do you ? " 
" Pretty amusing , yeah , " said Fred , looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear . 
" I ' ve got the form , Headmistress , " he said hoarsely , waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk . 
" I ' ve got the form and I ' ve got the whips waiting … oh , let me do it now … " 
" Very good , Argus , " she said . 
" You two , " she went on , gazing down at Fred and George , " are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school . " 
" You know what ? " said Fred . " I don't think we are . " 
He turned to his twin . 
" George , " said Fred , " I think we ' ve outgrown full - time education . " 
" Time to test our talents in the real world , d ' you reckon ? " asked Fred . 
" Definitely , " said George . 
And before Umbridge could say a word , they raised their wands and said together : 
" Accio brooms ! " 
Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance . 
Looking to his left , he ducked just in time . 
Fred and George's broomsticks , one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall , were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners ; 
they turned left , streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins , the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor . 
Fred looked around at the assembled students , at the silent , watchful crowd . 
" If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp , as demonstrated upstairs , come to number ninetythree , Diagon Alley - Weasleys ' Wizarding Wheezes , " he said in a loud voice . 
" Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they ' re going to use our products to get rid of this old bat , " added George , pointing at Professor Umbridge . 
" STOP THEM ! " shrieked Umbridge , but it was too late . 
As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in , Fred and George kicked off from the floor , shooting fifteen feet into the air , the iron peg swinging dangerously below . 
Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd . 
" Give her hell from us , Peeves . " 
And Peeves , who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before , swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset . 
The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend : within a week , even those who had been eye - witnesses were half - convinced they had seen the twins dive - bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors . 
In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them . 
Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon . 
For one thing , they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing . 
Eventually the area was roped off and Filch , gnashing his teeth furiously , was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms . 
Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but , just as in the case of Fred and Georges Wildfire Whiz - bangs , they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle . 
Then there were the two large broom - shaped holes in Umbridge's office door , through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters . 
Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where , it was rumored , Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it . 
However , her troubles were far from over . 
Inspired by Fred and George's example , a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers - in - Chief . 
In spite of the new door , somebody managed to slip a hairy - snouted Niffler into Umbridge's office , which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects , leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers . 
Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble - Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons , which ensured them a supply of fresh air , even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside - down goldfish bowls on their heads . 
Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands , desperate to catch miscreants , but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn . 
Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes ; Pansy Parkinson , to Hermiones delight , missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers . 
Meanwhile , it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts . 
Shrieking with rage and frustration , she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source , but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from ' Umbridge - itis ' . 
After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret , she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding , swooning , sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves . 
But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos , Peeves , who seemed to have taken Fred's parting words deeply to heart . 
Cackling madly , he soared through the school , upending tables , bursting out of blackboards , toppling statues and vases ; twice he shut Mrs . Norris inside a suit of armor , from which she was rescued , yowling loudly , by the furious caretaker . 
Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles , juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students , caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows ; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms , dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and , whenever he fancied a break , spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke . 
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her . 
Indeed , a week after Fred and George's departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves , who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier , and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth , " It unscrews the other way . " 
To cap matters , Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet ; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive , looking extremely angry . 
" Should we say something ? " said Hermione in a worried voice , pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr . and Mrs . Montague marching inside . 
In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him ? " 
" Anyway , more trouble for Umbridge , isn't it ? " said Harry in a satisfied voice . 
Harry's spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair . 
Ron's grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty , trembled for a few seconds , then folded , causing the cup to crack into two . 
" Who cares ? " said Ron irritably , while his teacup stood up drunkenly again , trembling violently at the knees . 
If you want to worry about anyone , Hermione , worry about me ! " 
" You ? " she said , catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow - patterned legs , and replacing it in front of her . 
" When Mum's next letter finally gets through Umbridge's screening process , " said Ron bitterly , now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight , " I'm going to be in deep trouble . 
" But - " 
" It ' ll be my fault Fred and George left , you wait , " said Ron darkly . 
But I'm sure she won't , I mean , if it's really true they ' ve got premises in Diagon Alley , they must have been planning this for ages . " 
" It's a bit dodgy isn't it ? 
She ' ll want to know what they ' ve been up to , to get their hands on that sort of gold . " 
" Well , yes , that occurred to me , too , " said Hermione , allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's , whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop , " I ' ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . " 
" He hasn't , " said Harry curtly . 
" How do you know ? " said Ron and Hermione together . 
" Because - " Harry hesitated , but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come . 
I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June . " 
There was a shocked silence , then Hermione's teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor . 
" Oh , Harry , you didn't ! " she said . 
" Yes , I did , " said Harry mutinously . 
" And I don't regret it , either . 
" But this is excellent ! " said Ron , looking thrilled . 
" Yeah , I suppose you'd better , " said Harry dully , " specially if she thinks they ' re receiving stolen cauldrons or something . " 
Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson , but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self - restraint was bound to crack before long . 
Sure enough , once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine , she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air . 
Harry interrupted her before she had even started . 
" It's no good nagging me , it's done , " he said firmly . 
" Fred and George have got the gold - spent a good bit of it , too , by the sounds of it - and I can't get it back from them and I don't want to . 
" I wasn't going to say anything about Fred and George ! " she said in an injured voice . 
Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look . 
" No , I wasn't ! " she said angrily . 
" As a matter of fact , I was going to ask Harry when he's going to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons ! " 
Harry's heart sank . 
Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George's dramatic departure , which admittedly had taken many hours , Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius . 
As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place , it had been hard to think of what to tell them ; he had ended up saying , truthfully , that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons . 
He had been regretting this ever since ; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it . 
" You can't tell me you ' ve stopped having funny dreams , " Hermione said now , " because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night . " 
Harry threw Ron a furious look . 
Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself . 
" I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch , " Harry lied brutally . 
" I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle . " 
Ron's ears went red . 
Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure ; he had not , of course , dreamed anything of the sort . 
Last night , he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor . 
He had passed through the circular room , then the room full of clicking and dancing light , until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres . 
He had hurried straight towards row number ninety - seven , turned left , and ran along it … it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud … just a bit further … for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake … and before he had reached the end of the row , he had found himself lying in bed again , gazing up at the canopy of his four - poster . 
" You are trying to block your mind , aren't you ? " said Hermione , looking beadily at Harry . 
The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs , that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue . 
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision , his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all ; and when he did , his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams . 
He also suspected that part of his mind - the part that often spoke in Hermione's voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door , and sought to wake him before he could reach the journeys end . 
" You know , " said Ron , whose ears were still flaming red , " if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff , we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup . " 
" Yeah , I s ' pose so , " said Harry , glad of a change of subject . 
" I mean , we ' ve won one , lost one - if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday - " 
" Yeah , that's right , " said Harry , losing track of what he was agreeing to . 
Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard , determinedly not looking at him . 
The final match of the Quidditch season , Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw , was to take place on the last weekend of May . 
Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match , Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory , due mainly ( though of course nobody said it to him ) to Ron's abysmal goal - keeping record . 
" I mean , I can't get any worse , can I ? " he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match . 
" You know , " said Hermione , as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd , " I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around . 
Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head . 
" Oh , gosh , I forgot ! " said Hermione , watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins . 
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands . 
It was a fine , clear day ; Ron could not wish for better , and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of ' Weasley is our King ' . 
As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto . 
" … Bradley … Davies … Chang , " he said , and Harry felt his stomach perform , less of a back flip , more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on to the pitch , her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze . 
He was not sure what he wanted to happen any more , except that he could not stand any more rows . 
Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy . 
" And they ' re off ! " said Lee . " And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately , Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle , he dodges Johnson , he dodges Bell , he dodges Spinnet as well … he's going straight for goal ! 
He's going to shoot - and - and - " Lee swore very loudly . 
" And he's scored . " 
Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors . 
Predictably , horribly , the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing : " Weasley cannot save a thing He cannot block a single ring … " 
" Harry " said a hoarse voice in Harrys ear . 
" Hermione … " 
Harry looked round and saw Hagrid's enormous bearded face sticking between the seats . 
For some reason , Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen , though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else . 
" Listen , " he whispered , " can yeh come with me ? 
Now ? 
While ev ' ryone's watchin'the match ? " 
" Till the match is over ? " 
" No , " said Hagrid . 
Hagrid's nose was gently dripping blood . 
Harry had not seen him this close - up since his return to the school ; he looked utterly woebegone . 
He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats , causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them . 
The people in Hagrid's row were not complaining , merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible . 
" I ' ppreciate this , you two , I really do , " said Hag rid as they reached the stairs . 
" You mean Umbridge ? " said Harry . 
She must be expecting trouble at the match . " 
" Yeah , well , a bit o ' trouble wouldn ' hurt , " said Hagrid , pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted . 
" What is it , Hagrid ? " said Hermione , looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the Forest . 
" Yeh - yeh ' ll see in a mo ' , " said Hagrid , looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them . 
" It ' ll be Ravenclaw , " said Harry heavily . 
" Good … good … " said Hagrid distractedly . 
" Tha's good … " 
When they reached his cabin , Hermione turned automatically left towards the front door . 
Hagrid , however , walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the Forest , where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree . 
When he realized they were no longer with him , he turned . 
" Into the Forest ? " said Hermione , perplexed . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid , who was already striding away from them into the green gloom , his crossbow over his arm . 
Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him . 
" Hagrid , why are you armed ? " said Harry . 
" Jus ' a precaution , " said Hagrid , shrugging his massive shoulders . 
" You didn't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals , " said Hermione timidly . 
He sighed deeply . 
" Firenze said they ' re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore , " Harry said , tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid's profile . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid heavily . 
If I hadn'stepped in , I reckon they'd ' ve kicked Firenze ter death - " 
" They attacked him ? " said Hermione , sounding shocked . 
" He had half the herd on to him . " 
" And you stopped it ? " said Harry , amazed and impressed . 
" Lucky I was passin ' , really … an ' I'd ' ve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha ' before he started sendin ' me stupid warnin's ! " he added hotly and unexpectedly . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , startled , but Hagrid , scowling , did not elaborate . 
" Anyway , " he said , breathing a little more heavily than - usual , " since then the other centaurs ' ve bin livid with me , an'the trouble is they ' ve got a lot of influence in the Forest … cleverest creatures in here . " 
" Is that why we ' re here , Hagrid ? " asked Hermione . 
" The centaurs ? " 
" Ah , no , " said Hagrid , shaking his head dismissively , " no , it's not them . 
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk . 
They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals , but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the Forest . 
" Hagrid ! " said Harry , fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles , over which Hagrid had stepped with ease , and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the Forest path . 
" Where are we going ? " 
It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid , what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs , but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes , frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves . 
Harry's arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches . 
They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him . 
Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence . 
The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement , even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow , caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit . 
It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some kind of creature ; their absence struck him as rather ominous . 
He stopped suddenly and turned around ; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards . 
" Good ! " said Hermione , as Harry set her back on her feet . 
Hagrid's face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad . 
" Righ ' , " said Hagrid . 
" Well … see … the thing is … " 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , then back at him . 
" But you ' ve lasted this long - " Hermione said tentatively . 
" What makes you think - " 
" And was it ? " said Harry , before he could stop himself . 
I don ' wan'ter go , o ' course , but if it wasn ' fer … well … the special circumstances I'm abou ' ter explain to yeh , I'd leave righ ' now , before she's go ' the chance ter do it in front o ' the whole school , like she did with Trelawney . " 
Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest , but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands . 
" It's not the end o ' the world , I ' ll be able ter help Dumbledore once I'm outta here , I can be useful ter the Order . 
His voice trembled and broke . 
He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it . 
See , if I go … well , I can ' leave withou ' … withou ' tellin'someone … because I ' ll - I ' ll need yeh two ter help me . 
An ' Ron , if he's willin ' . " 
" Of course we ' ll help you , " said Harry at once . 
" What do you want us to do ? " 
Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force Harry was knocked sideways into a tree . 
They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes ; Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop . 
They crept forwards and Harry saw that they were facing a large , smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought , with a jolt of dread , was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal . 
Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound , so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade , behind which Harry , Hermione and Hagrid now stood . 
" Sleepin ' , " breathed Hagrid . 
Sure enough , Harry could hear a distant , rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work . 
He glanced sideways at Hermione , who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open . 
She looked utterly terrified . 
" Hagrid , " she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature , " who is he ? " 
Harry found this an odd question … " What is it ? " 
was the one he had been planning on asking . 
" Hagrid , you told us - " said Hermione , her wand now shaking in her hand , " you told us none of them wanted to come ! " 
Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then , as realization hit him , he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror . 
The great mound of earth , on which he , Hermione and Hagrid could easily have stood , was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep , grunting breathing . 
It was not a mound at all . 
It was the curved back of what was clearly — 
" Why - what - oh , Hagrid ! " 
" He's been hurting you all this time , hasn't he ? 
" So , this is why it took you two months to get home ! " said Hermione distractedly . 
" Oh , Hagrid , why did you bring him back if he didn't want to come ? 
" Small ? " said Hermione . 
" Hermione , I couldn ' leave him , " said Hagrid , tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard . 
Hermione simply stared at him , her mouth open . 
" Hagrid , when you say ' brother ' , " said Harry slowly , " d o you mean — ? " 
" Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad , an'she went an ' had Grawp here - " 
" Grawp ? " said Harry . 
" Yeah … well , tha's what it sounds like when he says his name , " said Hagrid anxiously . 
" Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back ? " asked Harry . 
" Bu ' - bu'she got a bit tired o ' him after a while , I must admit … so we split up on the journey home … she promised not ter tell anyone , though … " 
" How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing ? " said Harry . 
" Oh , Hagrid , why on earth didn't you let him ! " said Hermione , flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands . 
" What do you think you ' re going to do with a violent giant who doesn't even want to be here ! " 
" Well , now - ' violent ' - tha's a bit harsh , " said Hagrid , still twisting his hands agitatedly . 
Harry asked . 
He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them . 
" You have to keep him tied up ? " said Hermione faintly . 
Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the Forest . 
" So , what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do ? " Hermione asked apprehensively . 
" After I'm gone . " 
Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks , Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked . 
" Not food or anythin ' ! " said Hagrid eagerly . 
" He can get his own food , no problem . 
Harry said nothing , but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them . 
What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognized as Grawp's head . 
It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head , and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling , closegrowing hair the color of bracken . 
The rim of a single large , fleshy ear was visible on top of the head , which seemed to sit , rather like Uncle Vernon's , directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between . 
The back , under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together , was very broad ; and as Grawp slept , it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins . 
The legs were curled up under the body . 
Harry could see the soles of enormous , filthy , bare feet , large as sledges , resting one on top of the other on the earthy Forest floor . 
" You want us to teach him , " Harry said in a hollow voice . 
He now understood what Firenze's warning had meant . 
His attempt is not working . 
He would do better to abandon it . 
Of course , the other creatures who lived in the Forest would have heard Hagrids fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English . 
Harry looked at Hermione , who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face . 
" We ' ll … " said Harry , already bound by his promise . 
" We ' ll try , Hagrid . " 
" Wha — no ! " said Hermione , jumping up . 
But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp . 
When he was about ten feet away , he lifted a long , broken bough from the ground , smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione , then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough . 
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest ; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away . 
In front of Harry and Hermione , meanwhile , the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground , which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees . 
He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him . 
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights . 
Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted . 
They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing . 
The nose was stubby and shapeless , the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half - bricks ; the eyes , small by giant standards , were a muddy greenish - brown and just now were half - gummed together with sleep . 
Grawp raised dirty knuckles , each as big as a cricket ball , to his eyes , rubbed vigorously , then , without warning , pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility . 
" Oh my ! " Harry heard Hermione squeal , terrified , beside him . 
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously . 
He was , as Hagrid had said , at least sixteen feet tall . 
Gazing blearily around , Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella , seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside - down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it ; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself . 
" Anyway , Grawpy , " shouted Hagrid , looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs , " I ' ve brought some friends ter meet yeh . 
Remember , I told yeh I might ? 
Remember , when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an ' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit ? 
Remember that , Grawpy ? " 
But Grawp merely gave another low roar ; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech . 
He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him , evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go . 
" Now , Grawpy , don'do that ! " 
shouted Hagrid . 
" Tha's how you ended up pullin ' up the others - " 
And sure enough , Harry could see the earth around the tree's roots beginning to crack . 
" Oh , Hagrid , don't , " moaned Hermione , but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp's knee a sharp poke . 
The giant let go of the top of the tree , which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of pine needles , and looked down . 
" This , " said Hagrid , hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood , " is Harry , Grawp ! 
Harry Potter ! 
The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there . 
They watched , in great trepidation , as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them . 
" An'this is Hermione , see ? Her — " Hagrid hesitated . 
Turning to Hermione , he said , " Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy , Hermione ? 
" No , not at all , " squeaked Hermione . 
" This is Hermy , Grawp ! 
Eh ? Two friends fer yeh ter - GRAWPY , NO ! " 
Grawp's hand had shot out of nowhere towards Hermione ; Harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree , so that Grawp's fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air . 
" BAD BOY , GRAWPY ! " they heard Hagrid yelling , as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree , shaking and whimpering . 
Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back , his hand over his nose . 
" Righ ' , " said Hagrid thickly , getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow , " well … there yeh are … yeh ' ve met him an ' - an ' now he ' ll know yeh when yeh come back . 
Yeah … well … " 
He looked up at Grawp , who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face ; the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground . 
Harry and Hermione nodded . 
Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and , still pinching his nose , led the way back into the trees . 
Nobody spoke for a while , not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last . 
Hermione's face was pale and set . 
Harry could not think of a single thing to say . 
What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest ? 
And he had promised that he , Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrid's totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant . 
How could Hagrid , even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless , fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans ? 
" Hold it , " said Hagrid abruptly , just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him . 
He pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow . 
Harry and Hermione raised their wands ; now that they had stopped walking , they , too , could hear movement close by . 
" Oh , blimey " said Hagrid quietly . 
" I thought we told you , Hagrid , " said a deep male voice , " that you are no longer welcome here ? " 
This centaur had a proud , high - cheekboned face and long black hair . 
Like Hagrid , he was armed ; a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders . 
" How are yeh , Magorian ? " said Hagrid warily . 
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him . 
Harry recognized the black - bodied and bearded Bane , whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze . 
" We agreed , I think , what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the Forest again ? " 
" ' This human ' now , am I ? " said Hagrid testily . 
Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us . " 
" Firenze has entered into servitude to humans , " said a grey centaur with a hard , deeply lined face . 
" Servitude ! " said Hagrid scathingly . 
" He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans , " said Magorian quietly . 
" If yeh say so , " said Hagrid , shrugging , " but personally I think yeh ' re makin ' a big mistake - " 
" As are you , human , " said Bane , " coming back into our Forest when we warned you - " 
" I ' ll have less of the ' our ' Forest , if it's all the same ter yeh . 
" No more is it up to you , Hagrid , " said Magorian smoothly . 
" I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young — " 
" They're not his ! " interrupted Bane contemptuously . 
" Nevertheless , " said Magorian calmly , " the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime - we do not touch the innocent . 
Henceforth , stay away from this place . 
You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us . " 
" Hagrid , " said Hermione in a high - pitched and terrified voice , as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground , " let's go , please let's go ! " 
Hagrid moved forwards , but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian . 
" We know what you are keeping in the Forest , Hagrid ! " Magorian called after them , as the centaurs slipped out of sight . 
Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian . 
" Yeh ' ll tolerate ' im as long as he's here , it's as much his Forest as yours ! " he yelled , as Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid's moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards . 
Still scowling , he looked down ; his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him ; he seemed not to have felt it . 
" Hagrid , " said Hermione breathlessly , skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there , " if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest , it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able - " 
At last they rejoined the path and , after another ten minutes , the trees began to thin ; they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and , in the distance , the definite sounds of cheering and shouting . 
" Was that another goal ? " asked Hagrid , pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view . 
" Or d ' yeh reckon the match is over ? " 
" I don't know , " said Hermione miserably . 
Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear ; her hair was full of twigs and leaves , her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms . 
" Good idea , " said Harry . 
" I don't believe him , " said Hermione in a very unsteady voice , the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid . 
" I don't believe him . 
I really don't believe him . " 
" Calm down , " said Harry . 
" Calm down ! " she said feverishly . 
" A giant ! 
A giant in the Forest ! 
And we ' re supposed to give him English lessons ! 
Always assuming , of course , we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out ! 
I - don't - believe - him ! " 
Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice , as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle . 
" He's not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen . " 
" Oh , come off it , Harry ! " said Hermione angrily , stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her . 
" Of course he's going to be chucked out and , to be perfectly honest , after what we ' ve just seen , who can blame Umbridge ? " 
There was a pause in which Harry glared at her , and her eyes filled slowly with tears . 
" You didn't mean that , " said Harry quietly . 
" But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself - for us ? ' 
" I dunno - " 
" Weasley is our King , Weasley is our King , He didn't let the Quaffle in , Weasley is our King … " 
" And I wish they'd stop singing that stupid song , " said Hermione miserably , " haven't they gloated enough ? " 
A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch . 
" Oh , let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins , " said Hermione . 
" Weasley can save anything , He never leaves a single ring , That's why Gryffindors all sing , Weasley is our King . " 
" Hermione … " said Harry slowly . 
The song was growing louder , but it was issuing not from a crowd of green - and - silver - clad Slytherins , but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle , bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders . 
" Weasley is our King , Weasley is our King , He didn't let the Quaffle in , Weasley is our King … " 
" No ? " said Hermione in a hushed voice . 
" YES ! " said Harry loudly . 
" HARRY ! HERMIONE ! " yelled Ron , waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself . 
They beamed up at him as he passed . 
There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel , but nobody seemed to want to put him down . 
Still singing , the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight . 
Harry and Hermione watched them go , beaming , until the last echoing strains of ' Weasley is our King'died away . 
Then they turned to each other , their smiles fading . 
" Yes , all right , " said Hermione wearily . 
" I'm not in any hurry . " 
They climbed the steps together . 
At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination , but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance , almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots . 
All he wanted to do was talk over the match , so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp . 
Not that either of them tried very hard ; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion . 
As it was another fine , warm day , they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake , where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room . 
Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair , not to mention the occasional outbursts of ' Weasley is our King ' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good . 
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time . 
" Well , I mean , I'd already let in that one of Davies's , so I wasn't feeling all that confident , but I dunno , when Bradley came towards me , just out of nowhere , I thought - you can do this ! 
And I had about a second to decide which way to fly , you know , because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right , obviously , his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting , and so I took the chance and flew left - his right , I mean - and - well - you saw what happened , " he concluded modestly , sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them — a bunch of gossiping third - year Hufflepuffs — had heard him . 
" Why are you grinning ? " 
" I'm not , " said Harry quickly , and looked down at his Transfiguration notes , attempting to straighten his face . 
The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree . 
" I'm just glad we won , that's all . " 
" Yeah , " said Ron slowly , savoring the words , " we won . 
Did you see the look on Changs face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose ? " 
" I suppose she cried , did she ? " said Harry bitterly . 
" Er - " said Harry . 
" Well , actually … no , Ron , " said Hermione with a heavy sigh , putting down her book and looking at him apologetically . 
" As a matter of fact , the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal . " 
" You didn't watch ? " he said faintly , looking from one to the other . 
" But Ron , we didn't want to leave — we had to ! " 
" It was Hagrid , " said Harry . 
" He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants . 
He wanted us to go into the Forest with him , we had no choice , you know how he gets . 
Anyway … " 
The story was told in five minutes , by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity . 
" He brought one back and hid it in the Forest ? " 
" Yep , " said Harry grimly . 
" Well , he has , " said Hermione firmly . 
" And Hagrid wants us to … ? " 
" Teach him English , yeah , " said Harry . 
" Yes , " said Hermione irritably , turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses . 
" Yes , I'm starting to think he has . 
But , unfortunately , he made Harry and me promise . " 
" Well , you ' re just going to have to break your promise , that's all , " said Ron firmly . 
And anyway … remember Norbert ? 
" I know , it's just that - we promised , " said Hermione in a small voice . 
Ron smoothed his hair flat again , looking preoccupied . 
" Well , " he sighed , " Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet , has he ? 
The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted ; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake ; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze . 
If he had , then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry . 
This suited Harry very well ; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape , and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency ; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself , and had not laid out any elf clothes for days . 
She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer . 
Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their study habits . 
" How many hours d ' you think you ' re doing a day ? " he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology , a manic gleam in his eyes . 
" I dunno , " said Ron . " A few . " 
" More or less than eight ? " 
" Less , I s ' pose , " said Ron , looking slightly alarmed . 
" I'm doing eight , " said Ernie , puffing out his chest . 
I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day . 
I can do ten on a good weekend day . 
I did nine and a half on Monday . 
Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter . 
Then on Wednesday - " 
Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point , forcing Ernie to abandon his recital . 
Meanwhile , Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic . 
" Of course , it's not what you know , " he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start , " it's who you know . 
Now , Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda 
" Do you think that's true ? " Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron . 
" Nothing we can do about it if it is , " said Ron gloomily . 
" I don't think it's true , " said Neville quietly from behind them . 
" Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's , and she's never mentioned the Malfoys . " 
" What's she like , Neville ? " asked Hermione at once . 
" Is she strict ? " 
" Bit like Gran , really , " said Neville in a subdued voice . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione glanced at each other , but didn't know what to say . 
It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital . 
Meanwhile , a flourishing black - market trade in aids to concentration , mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth - and seventh - years . 
Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth - year Eddie Carmichael , who swore it was solely responsible for the nine ' Outstanding ' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons . 
Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job , but before they could close the deal , Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet . 
" Hermione , we wanted to buy that ! " shouted Ron . 
" Not any more , " said Hermione . 
None of these things actually work , you know . " 
" This stuff can , " said Hermione grimly . 
" I ' ve had a look at it , and it's actually dried Doxy droppings . " 
This information took the edge off Harry and Rons desire for brain stimulants . 
" As you can see , " Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard , " your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks . 
You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons . 
" Now , I must warn you that the most stringent anti - cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers . 
Our new - Headmistress — " Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt " - has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because , of course , your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - " 
" - however , that is no reason not to do your very best . 
You have your own futures to think about . " 
" Please , Professor , " said Hermione , her hand in the air , " when will we find out our results ? " 
" An owl will be sent to you some time in July " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Excellent , " said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper , " so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays . " 
Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks ' time , waiting for his OWL results . 
Well , he thought dully , at least he would be sure of one bit of post next summer . 
Their first examination , Theory of Charms , was scheduled for Monday morning . 
Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday , but regretted it almost at once ; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right , finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming . 
Meanwhile , Ron was reading two years ' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears , his lips moving soundlessly ; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor , reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 5 ; and Parvati and Lavender , who were practicing basic Locomotion Charms , were making their pencil - cases race each other around the edge of the table . 
Dinner was a subdued affair that night . 
Harry and Ron did not talk much , but ate with gusto , having studied hard all day . 
Hermione , on the other hand , kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag , from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure . 
Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night , when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate . 
" Oh , my goodness , " she said faintly , staring into the Entrance Hall . 
" Is that them ? 
Is that the examiners ? " 
Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench . 
Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient - looking witches and wizards . 
Umbridge , Harry was pleased to see , looked rather nervous . 
Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall , slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners . 
Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny , stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs ; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially . 
Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf ; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart . 
she said impatiently . 
" No idea where he is , I suppose ? " 
" None at all , " said Umbridge , shooting a malevolent look at Harry , Ron and Hermione , who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace . 
" But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough . " 
" I doubt it , " shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks , " not if Dumbledore doesn't want to be found ! 
I should know … examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs … did things with a wand I'd never seen before . " 
" Yes … well … " said Professor Umbridge as Harry , Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared , " let me show you to the staff room . 
Everyone was trying to do some last - minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far . 
Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours . 
He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did . 
He knew he was not the only one lying awake , but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally , one by one , they fell asleep . 
None of the fifth - years talked very much at breakfast next day , either : Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched ; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred ; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade . 
Once breakfast was over , the fifth - and seventh - years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons ; then , at half past nine , they were called forwards class by class to re - enter the Great Hall , which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father , Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs ; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one , all facing the staff - table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them . 
When they were all seated and quiet , she said , " You may begin , " and turned over an enormous hour - glass on the desk beside her , on which there were also spare quills , ink bottles and rolls of parchment . 
Harry turned over his paper , his heart thumping hard - three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling - and lowered his eyes to the first question : a ) Give the incantation and b ) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly . 
Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll … smiling slightly , he bent over the paper and began to write . 
" Well , it wasn't too bad , was it ? " 
asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later , still clutching the exam paper . 
" I'm not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms , I just ran out of time . 
I wasn't , sure whether I ought to , it felt like too much - and on question twenty - three - " 
" Hermione , " said Ron sternly , " we ' ve been through this before … we ' re not going through every exam afterwards , it's bad enough doing them once . " 
The fifth - years ate lunch with the rest of the school ( the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour ) , then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall , where they were to wait until called for their practical examination . 
As small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order , those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand movements , occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake . 
Hermione's name was called . 
Trembling , she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein , Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass . 
Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards , so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done . 
" She ' ll be fine , remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests ? " said Ron . 
Ten minutes later , Professor Flitwick called , " Parkinson , Pansy - Patil , Padma - Patil , Parvati - Potter , Harry . " 
" Good luck , " said Ron quietly . 
Harry walked into the Great Hall , clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook . 
" Professor Tofty is free , Potter , " squeaked Professor Flitwick , who was standing just inside the door . 
He pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner , a short distance from Professor Marchbanks , who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy . 
" The famous Potter ? " 
Out of the corner of his eye , Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him ; the wine - glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed . 
Harry could not suppress a grin ; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly . 
" That's it , " he said in his quavery old voice , " no need to be nervous . 
Now , if I could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me . " 
His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy's had been , though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color Change and Growth Charms , so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake . 
He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards . 
He could tell Ron , though ; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened . 
There was no time to relax that night ; they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day ; Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories . 
At least he managed to Vanish the whole of his iguana , whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos , causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall . 
They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday ( other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium , Harry felt he had done reasonably well ) ; and then , on Thursday , Defense Against the Dark Arts . 
Here , for the first time , Harry felt sure he had passed . 
He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure , during the practical examination , in performing all the counter - jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge , who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall . 
" Oh , bravo ! " cried Professor Tofty , who was examining Harry again , when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell . 
" Very good indeed ! 
Well , I think that's all , Potter … unless … " 
He leaned forwards a little . 
" I heard , from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden , that you can produce a Patronus ? 
For a bonus point … ? " 
Harry raised his wand , looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked . 
" Expecto patronum ! " 
His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall . 
All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically . 
" Excellent ! " he said . 
" Very well , Potter , you may go ! " 
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door , their eyes met . 
There was a nasty smile playing around her wide , slack mouth , but he did not care . 
Unless he was very much mistaken ( and he was not planning on telling anybody , in case he was ) , he had just achieved an ' Outstanding ' OWL . 
On Friday , Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam , and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision . 
They stretched and yawned beside the open window , through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess . 
Harry could see Hagrid in the distance , teaching a class on the edge of the Forest . 
He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining - he thought it must be unicorns , because the boys seemed to be standing back a little - when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in , looking thoroughly bad - tempered . 
" How were the Runes ? " said Ron , yawning and stretching . 
" I mistranslated ehwaz , " said Hermione furiously . 
" Ah well , " said Ron lazily , " that's only one mistake , isn't it , you ' ll still get - " 
" Oh , shut up ! " said Hermione angrily . 
" It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail . 
And what's more , someone's put another Niffler in Umbridge's office . 
I don't know how they got it through that new door , but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off - by the sound of it , it tried to take a chunk out of her leg - " 
" Good , " said Harry and Ron together . 
" She thinks it's Hagrid doing it , remember ? 
And we do not want Hagrid chucked out ! " 
" He's teaching at the moment ; she can't blame him , " said Harry , gesturing out of the window . 
" Oh , you ' re so naive sometimes , Harry . You really think Umbridge will wait for proof ? " said Hermione , who seemed determined to be in a towering temper , and she swept off towards the girls'dormitories , banging the door behind her . 
" Such a lovely , sweet - tempered girl , " said Ron , very quietly , prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights . 
Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend , though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday , the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least - and which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror . 
Sure enough , he found the written paper difficult , though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion ; he could describe its effects accurately , having taken it illegally in his second year . 
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be . 
With Snape absent from the proceedings , he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions . 
Neville , who was sitting very near Harry , also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class . 
" Only four exams left , " said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room . 
" Only ! " said Hermione snappishly . 
Nobody was foolish enough to snap back , so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first - years for giggling too loudly in the common room . 
Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesdays Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down . 
The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest , where students were required to correctly identify the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs ( the trick was to offer them all milk in turn : Knarls , highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties , generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them ) ; then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle ; feed and clean out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns ; and choose , from a wide selection of food , the diet they would give a sick unicorn . 
Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window . 
When Harry's examiner , a plump little witch this time , smiled at him and told him he could leave , Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs - up before heading back to the castle . 
Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all Jupiter's moons right , but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice . 
They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy ; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination . 
He might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball ; he lost his head completely during tea - leaf reading , saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round , dark , soggy stranger , and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday . 
He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball , only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiner's reflection . 
" We shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place , " said Harry . 
" Still , at least we can give it up now . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" And from now on , I don't care if my tea - leaves spell die , Ron , die - I'm just chucking them in the bin where they belong . " 
Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them . 
" Well , I think I ' ve done all right in Arithmancy " she said , and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief . 
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o ' clock , they found a perfect night for stargazing , cloudless and still . 
The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air . 
Each of them set up his or her telescope and , when Professor Marchbanks gave the word , proceeded to fill in the blank star - chart they had been given . 
Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them , watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing . 
All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment , the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand , and the scribbling of many quills . 
Half an hour passed , then an hour ; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished . 
As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart , however , the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing , so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn . 
Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more . 
Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it , now examining Venus . 
He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there , but something distracted him ; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment , he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn . 
If they had not been moving , and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads , they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked . 
Even at this distance , Harry had a funny feeling he recognized the walk of the squattest of them , who seemed to be leading the group . 
He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight , much less accompanied by five others . 
Then somebody coughed behind him , and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam . 
Jamming his eye to his telescope , he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when , alert for any odd sound , he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds , followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog . 
He looked up , his heart hammering . 
There were lights on in Hagrid's windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them . 
The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold . 
The door closed again and there was silence . 
Harry felt very uneasy . 
He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had , but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and , not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work , Harry hastily bent over his starchart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin . 
Figures were now moving across the cabin windows , temporarily blocking the light . 
He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope , staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago , but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower . 
Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin . 
" Try and concentrate , now , boys and girls , " he said softly . 
Harry looked to his left . 
Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin . 
" Ahem - twenty minutes to go , " said Professor Tofty . 
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star - chart ; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as Mars . 
He bent to correct it . 
There was a loud BANG from the grounds . 
Several people cried ' Ouch ! ' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below . 
Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists , surrounded by six people , all of whom , judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction , seemed to be attempting to Stun him . 
" No ! " cried Hermione . 
" My dear ! " said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice . 
" This is an examination ! " 
But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star - charts any more . 
Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid's cabin , yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him ; he was still upright and still , as far as Harry could see , fighting . 
Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang , attempting to defend Hagrid , leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground . 
Hagrid gave a howl of fury , lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him ; the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again . 
Hermione gasped , both hands over her mouth ; Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he , too , was looking scared . 
None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before . 
" Look ! " squealed Parvati , who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again ; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn . 
" Now , really ! " said Professor Tofty anxiously . 
But nobody paid him the slightest attention : they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside Hagrid's cabin . 
" How dare you ! " the figure shouted as she ran . 
" How dare you ! " 
" It's McGonagall ! " whispered Hermione . 
Hermione , Parvati and Lavender all screamed . 
shouted Professor Tofty , who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely . 
" COWARDS ! " bellowed Hagrid , his voice carring clearly to the top of the tower , and several lights flickered back on inside the castle . 
" Oh my — " gasped Hermione . 
Harry saw Hagrid double over , and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell . 
But , on the contrary , next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back - then Harry realized that Fang's limp body was draped around his shoulders . 
" Get him , get him ! " 
screamed Umbridge , but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid's fists ; indeed , he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over . 
Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck . 
Then Professor Tofty's voice said feebly , " Um … five minutes to go , everybody . " 
Though he had only filled in two - thirds of his chart , Harry was desperate for the exam to end . 
When it came at last he , Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase . 
None of the students were going to bed ; they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed . 
" Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night ! " 
" She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's , " said Ernie Macmillan sagely , squeezing over to join them . 
" Its very hard to Stun a giant , they ' re like trolls , really tough … but poor Professor McGonagall … four Stunners straight in the chest and she's not exactly young , is she ? " 
People around them were drifting away , still talking excitedly about what they had just seen . 
" At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban , " said Ron . " I'spect he's gone to join Dumbledore , hasn't he ? " 
" I suppose so , " said Hermione , who looked tearful . 
" Oh , this is awful , I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long , but now we ' ve lost Hagrid too . " 
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full . 
Seamus and Dean , who had arrived ahead of Harry , Ron and Hermione , were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower . 
" But why sack Hagrid now ? " asked Angelina Johnson , shaking her head . 
" And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office , " piped up Katie Bell . 
Fred and George left me a couple ; I ' ve been levitating them in through her window . " 
" She'd have sacked him anyway " said Dean . " He was too close to Dumbledore . " 
" That's true , " said Harry , sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's . 
" I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right , " said Lavender tearfully . 
" They carried her back up to the castle , we watched through the dormitory window , " said Colin Creevey " She didn't look very well . " 
" Madam Pomfrey will sort her out , " said Alicia Spinnet firmly . 
" She's never failed yet . " 
It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared . 
Harry felt wide awake ; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him ; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her , though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast - Ended Skrewts had its merits . 
Their final exam , History of Magic , was not to take place until that afternoon . 
Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast , but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last - minute revision , so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common - room window , trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the notes stacked three - and - ahalf feet high that Hermione had lent him . 
The fifth - years entered the Great Hall at two o ' clock and took their places in front of their facedown examination papers . 
Harry felt exhausted . 
He just wanted this to be over , so that he could go and sleep ; then tomorrow , he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch - he was going to have a fly on Rons broom - and savor their freedom from revision . 
" Turn over your papers , " said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall , flicking over the giant hour - glass . 
" You may begin . " 
Harry stared fixedly at the first question . 
It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it ; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows . 
Slowly , tortuously , he at last began to write an answer . 
He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates . 
He simply skipped question four ( In your opinion , did wand legislation contribute to , or lead to better control of , goblin riots of the eighteenth century ? ) , thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end . 
He had a stab at question five ( How wasthe Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence ? ) but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points ; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere . 
He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten : Describe the circumstances that led to the form ation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join . 
I know this , Harry thought , though his brain felt torpid and slack . 
He began to write , looking up now and again to check the large hour - glass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks . 
He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil , whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair . 
Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly , and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it . 
… the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord , but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein , because - 
The sun was very hot on the back of his head . 
What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein ? 
Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls … he gazed blankly at the back of Parvati's head again . 
If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein … 
Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands , so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool . 
Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll - hunting and give the trolls rights … but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls … that was it . 
He opened his eyes ; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment . 
He closed his eyes again , trying to see them , trying to remember … the Confederation had met for the first time in France , yes , he had written that already … 
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come … 
Think , he told himself , his face in his hands , while all around him quills scratched out neverending answers and the sand trickled through the hour - glass at the front … 
He was walking along the cool , dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again , walking with a firm and purposeful tread , breaking occasionally into a run , determined to reach his destination at last … the black door swung open for him as usual , and here he was in the circular room with its many doors … 
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door … patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking , but no time to explore , he must hurry … 
He jogged the last few feet to the third door , which swung open just like the others … 
Once again he was in the cathedral - sized room full of shelves and glass spheres … his heart was beating very fast now … he was going to get there this time … when he reached number ninetyseven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows … 
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end , a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal … Harry's stomach contracted with fear … with excitement … 
A voice issued from his own mouth , a high , cold voice empty of any human kindness … 
" Take it for me … lift it down , now … I cannot touch it … but you can " 
The black shape on the floor shifted a little . 
Harry saw a long - fingered white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm … heard the high , cold voice say " Crucio ! " 
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain , attempted to stand but fell back , writhing . 
Harry was laughing . 
He raised his wand , the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless . 
" Lord Voldemort is waiting " 
Very slowly , his arms trembling , the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head . 
" You ' ll have to kill me , " whispered Sirius . 
" Undoubtedly I shall in the end , " said the cold voice . 
" But you will fetch it for me first , Black … you think you have felt pain thus far ? 
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again ; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor ; Harry awoke as he hit the ground , still yelling , his scar on fire , as the Great Hall erupted all around him . 
CHAPTER THIRTY - TWO : Out of the Fire 
" I'm not going … I don't need the hospital wing … I don't want " 
He was gibbering as he tried to pull away from Professor Tofty , who was looking at Harry with much concern after helping him out into the Entrance Hall with the students all around them staring . 
" I'm - I'm fine , sir , " Harry stammered , wiping the sweat from his face . 
" Really … I just fell asleep … had a nightmare … " 
" Pressure of examinations ! " said the old wizard sympathetically , patting Harry shakily on the shoulder . 
" It happens , young man , it happens ! 
Now , a cooling drink of water , and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall ? 
" Yes , " said Harry wildly . 
" I mean … no … I ' ve done - done as much as I can , I think … " 
" I shall go and collect your examination paper and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down . " 
" I ' ll do that , " said Harry , nodding vigorously . 
The second that the old man's heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall , Harry ran up the marble staircase , hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches , up more flights of stairs , and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing , causing Madam Pomfrey - who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague's open mouth - to shriek in alarm . 
" Potter , what do you think you ' re doing ? " 
" I need to see Professor McGonagall , " gasped Harry , the breath tearing his lungs . 
" Now … it's urgent ! " 
" She's not here , Potter , " said Madam Pomfrey sadly . 
" She was transferred to St . Mungo's this morning . 
Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age ? 
" She's … gone ? " said Harry , shocked . 
The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him . 
He remained quite still , looking at Madam Pomfrey . 
There was nobody left to tell . 
Dumbledore had gone , Hagrid had gone , but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there , irascible and inflexible , perhaps , but always dependably , solidly present … 
" Yes , " said Harry blankly . 
He wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood , buffeted by the crowd , panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do … 
Ron and Hermione , said a voice in his head . 
He was running again , pushing students out of the way , oblivious to their angry protests . 
He sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him . 
" Harry ! " said Hermione at once , looking very frightened . 
" What happened ? 
Are you all right ? 
Are you ill ? " 
" Where have you been ? " demanded Ron . 
" Come with me , " Harry said quickly . 
" Come on , I ' ve got to tell you something . " 
He led them along the first - floor corridor , peering through doorways , and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived , closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside , and leaned against it , facing them . 
" Voldemort's got Sirius . " 
" What ? " 
" How d ' you - ? " 
" Saw it . 
Just now . 
When I fell asleep in the exam . " 
" But - but where ? 
How ? " said Hermione , whose face was white . 
" I dunno how , " said Harry . 
" But I know exactly where . 
There's a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and they ' re at the end of row ninetyseven … he's trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there … he's torturing him … says he ' ll end by killing him ! " 
He moved over to a desk and sat down on it , trying to master himself . 
" How ' re we going to get there ? " he asked them . 
There was a moment's silence . 
Then Ron said , " G - get there ? " 
" Get to the Department of Mysteries , so we can rescue Sirius ! " 
Harry said loudly . 
" But - Harry … " said Ron weakly . 
" What ? 
What ? " said Harry . 
He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable . 
" Harry , " said Hermione in a rather frightened voice , " er … how … how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there ? " 
" How do I know ? " bellowed Harry . 
" The question is how we ' re going to get in there ! " 
" But … Harry , think about this , " said Hermione , taking a step towards him , " it's five o ' clock in the afternoon … the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers … how would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen ? 
Harry … they ' re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world … you think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected ? " 
Harry shouted . 
" You ' ve never been there , Harry , " said Hermione quietly . 
Harry shouted in her face , standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn . 
He wanted to shake her . 
" How d ' you explain Ron's dad then , what was all that about , how come I knew what had happened to him ? " 
" But why , " Hermione persisted , " why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon , or whatever the thing is ? " 
" You know what , I ' ve just thought of something , " said Ron in a hushed voice . 
" Sirius's brother was a Death Eater , wasn't he ? 
Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon ! " 
" Yeah - and that's why Dumbledore's been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time ! " said Harry . 
" Look , I'm sorry , " cried Hermione , " but neither of you is making sense , and we ' ve got no proof for any of this , no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there - " 
" Okay , " she said , looking frightened yet determined , " I ' ve just got to say this - " 
" What ? " 
But you do … sort of … I mean - don't you think you ' ve got a bit of a - a - saving - people thing ! " she said . 
He glared at her . 
" I mean … last year , for instance … in the lake … during the Tournament … you shouldn't have … I mean , you didn't need to save that little Delacour girl … you got a bit … carried away … " 
" I mean , it was really great of you and everything , " said Hermione quickly , looking positively petrified at the look on Harrys face , " everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do - " 
" That's funny , " said Harry through gritted teeth , " because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero … is that what you think this is ? 
You reckon I want to act the hero again ? " 
" No , no , no ! " said Hermione , looking aghast . 
" That's not what I mean at all ! " 
" Well , spit out what you ' ve got to say , because we ' re wasting time here ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" I'm trying to say - Voldemort knows you , Harry ! 
He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there , it's the kind of thing he does , he knows you ' re the - the sort of person who'd go to Sirius's aid ! 
What if he's just trying to get you into the Department of Myst — ? " 
" Hermione , it doesn't matter if he's done it to get me there or not - they ' ve taken McGonagall to St . Mungo's , there isn't anyone from the Order left at Hogwarts who we can tell , and if we don't go , Sirius is dead ! " 
" But Harry - what if your dream was - was just that , a dream ? " 
Harry let out a roar of frustration . 
Hermione actually stepped back from him , looking alarmed . 
Harry shouted at her , " I'm not having nightmares , I'm not just dreaming ! 
What d ' you think all the Occlumency was for , why d ' you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things ? 
Voldemort's got him , and no one else knows , and that means we ' re the only ones who can save him , and if you don't want to do it , fine , but I'm going , understand ? 
And if I remember rightly , you didn't have a problem with my saving - people thing when it was you I was saving from the Dementors , or - " he rounded on Ron " - when it was your sister I was saving from the Basilisk - " 
" I never said I had a problem ! " said Ron heatedly . 
" But Harry , you ' ve just said it , " said Hermione fiercely , " Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind , if you'd done Occlumency properly you'd never have seen this - " 
" Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind ! " 
The classroom door opened . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione whipped around . 
Ginny walked in , looking curious , closely followed by Luna , who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally . 
" Hi , " said Ginny uncertainly . 
" We recognized Harry's voice . 
What are you yelling about ? " 
" Never you mind , " said Harry roughly . 
Ginny raised her eyebrows . 
" There's no need to take that tone with me , " she said coolly , " I was only wondering whether I could help . " 
" Well , you can't , " said Harry shortly . 
" You ' re being rather rude , you know , " said Luna serenely . 
Harry swore and turned away . 
" Wait , " said Hermione suddenly . 
" Wait … Harry , they can help . " 
Harry and Ron looked at her . 
" Listen , " she said urgently , " Harry , we need to establish whether Sirius really has left Headquarters . " 
" I ' ve told you , I saw - " 
" Harry , I'm begging you , please ! " said Hermione desperately . 
" Please let's just check that Sirius isn't at home before we go charging off to London . 
If we find out he's not there , then I swear I won't try to stop you . 
I ' ll come , I ' ll d - do whatever it takes to try and save him . " 
" Sirius is being tortured NOW ! " shouted Harry . 
" We haven't got time to waste . " 
" But if this is a trick of Voldemort's , Harry , we ' ve got to check , we ' ve got to . " 
" How ? " Harry demanded . 
" How ' re we going to check ? " 
" We ' ll have to use Umbridge's fire and see if we can contact him , " said Hermione , who looked positively terrified at the thought . 
" We ' ll draw Umbridge away again , but we ' ll need lookouts , and that's where we can use Ginny and Luna . " 
Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on , Ginny said immediately , " Yeah , we ' ll do it , " and Luna said , " When you say ' Sirius ' , are you talking about Stubby Boardman ? " 
Nobody answered her . 
" Okay , " Harry said aggressively to Hermione , " Okay , if you can think of a way of doing this quickly , I'm with you , otherwise I'm going to the Department of Mysteries right now . " 
" But how are you going to get there ? " 
Again , Harry ignored her . 
" Right , " said Hermione , twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks . 
" Right … well … one of us has to go and find Umbridge and - and send her off in the wrong direction , keep her away from her office . 
They could tell her - I don't know - that Peeves is up to something awful as usual " 
" I ' ll do it , " said Ron at once . 
" I ' ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something , it's miles away from her office . 
Peeves to do it if I met him on the way . " 
It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department . 
" Now , we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry , or some Slytherins bound to go and tip her off . " 
" Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor , " said Ginny promptly , " and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garrotting Gas . " Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie ; Ginny shrugged and said , " Fred and George were planning to do it before they left . " 
" Okay , " said Hermione . 
" Well then , Harry , you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we ' ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius - " 
" He's not there , Hermione ! " 
" I mean , you can - can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch , I don't think you should be in there alone , Lee's already proved the windows a weak spot , sending those Nifflers through it . " 
Even through his anger and impatience , Harry recognized Hermiones offer to accompany him into Umbridge's office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty . 
" I … okay , thanks , " he muttered . 
" Right , well , even if we do all of that , I don't think we ' re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes , " said Hermione , looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan , " not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around . " 
" Five minutes ' ll be enough , " said Harry . 
" C ' mon , let's go - " 
" Now ? " said Hermione , looking shocked . 
" What did you think , we ' re going to wait until after dinner or something ? 
Hermione , Sirius is being tortured right now ! " 
" I - oh , all right , " she said desperately . 
" You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we ' ll meet you at the end of Umbridge's corridor , okay ? " 
Harry didn't answer , but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside . 
Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean , who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk - till - dawn end - of - exams celebration in the common room . 
Harry barely heard them . 
He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black - market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it , the 
Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky - " 
But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor , and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron , Hermione , Ginny and Luna , who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor . 
" So Ron - you go and head Umbridge off … Ginny , Luna , if you can start moving people out of the corridor … Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear … " 
Ron strode away , his bright - red hair visible right to the end of the passage ; meanwhile Ginnys equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction , trailed by Luna's blonde one . 
" Get over here , " muttered Hermione , tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column . 
" Are - are you sure you ' re okay , Harry ? 
" I'm fine , " he said shortly , tugging the Invisibil i ty Cloak from out of his bag . 
" Here , " he said ; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them . 
Ginny was calling to the crowd . 
" No , sorry , you ' re going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase , someone's let off Garrotting Gas just along here - " 
They could hear people complaining ; one surly voice said , " I can't see no gas . " 
" That's because it's colorless , " said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice , " but if you want to walk through it , carry on , then we ' ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn't believe us . " 
Slowly , the crowd thinned . 
The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread ; people were not coming this way any more . 
Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor . 
As they passed Ginny , Hermione whispered , " Good one … don't forget the signal . " 
" What's the signal ? " 
" A loud chorus of ' Weasly is our King ' if they see Umbridge coming , " replied Hermione , as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall . 
The garish kittens were basking in the late - afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates , but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time . 
" I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler . " 
They pulled off the Cloak ; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight , peering down into the grounds with her wand out . 
Harry dashed over to the fireplace , seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate , causing emerald flames to burst into life there . 
He knelt down quickly , thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried , " Number twelve , Grimmauld Place ! " 
His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fair - ground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor . 
He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long , cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place . 
There was nobody there . 
He had expected this , yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room . 
" Sirius , are you there ? " 
His voice echoed around the room , but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire . 
" Who's there ? " he called , wondering whether it was just a mouse . 
Kreacher the house - elf crept into view . 
" It's the Potter boy's head in the fire , " Kreacher informed the empty kitchen , stealing furtive , oddly triumphant glances at Harry . 
" Where's Sirius , Kreacher ? " 
Harry demanded . 
" Master has gone out , Harry Potter . " 
" Where's he gone ? 
Where's he gone , Kreacher ? " 
" What about Lupin ? 
Any of them , are any of them there ? " 
" Nobody here but Kreacher ! " said the elf gleefully , and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen . 
Harry yelled after the elf . 
" Kreacher , has he gone to the Department of Mysteries ? " 
Kreacher stopped in his tracks . 
Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him . 
" Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going , " said the elf quietly . 
" But you know ! " shouted Harry . 
You know where he is ! " 
" Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries ! " he said gleefully . 
And he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall . 
" You - ! " 
But before he could utter a single curse or insult , Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head ; he inhaled a lot of ash and , choking , found himself being dragged backwards through the flames , until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide , pallid face of Professor Umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go , as though she were going to slit his throat . 
" You think , " she whispered , bending Harry's neck back even further , so that he was looking up at the ceiling , " that after two Nifflers I was going to let one more foul , scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge ? 
Take his wand , " she barked at someone he could not see , and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand . 
Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her . 
" I want to know why you are in my office , " said Umbridge , shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered . 
" I was - trying to get my Firebolt ! " 
Harry croaked . 
She shook his head again . 
" Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons , as you very well know , Potter . 
" No one - " said Harry , trying to pull away from her . 
He felt several hairs part company with his scalp . 
Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode . 
Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill , smirking as he threw Harry's wand into the air one - handed and caught it again . 
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered , each gripping Ron , Ginny , Luna and - to Harry's bewilderment - Neville , who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation . 
" That one , " he poked a thick finger at Neville , " tried to stop me taking her , " he pointed at Ginny , who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her , " so I brought him along too . " 
" Well , it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley - free zone , doesn't it ? " 
Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically . 
Umbridge gave her wide , complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz - covered armchair , blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed . 
" So , Potter , " she said . 
" You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon , " she nodded at Ron — Malfoy laughed even louder - " to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes - Mr . Filch having just informed me so . 
" Clearly , it was very important for you to talk to somebody . 
Or the half - breed , Hagrid ? 
I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall , I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone . " 
Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that . 
Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking . 
Umbridge's slack face seemed to tighten . 
" Very well , " she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice . 
" Very well , Mr Potter … I offered you the chance to tell me freely . 
You refused . 
I have no alternative but to force you . 
Draco fetch Professor Snape . " 
Malfoy stowed Harry's wand inside his robes and left the room smirking , but Harry hardly noticed . 
He had just realized something ; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it . 
He had thought that all the members of the Order , all those who could help him save Sirius , were gone - but he had been wrong . 
There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts - Snape . 
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the Slytherins ' efforts to keep Ron and the others under control . 
Ron's lip was bleeding on to Umbridge's carpet as he struggled against Warrington's half - nelson ; Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth - year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip ; Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe's arms ; and Hermione was attempting , in vain , to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her . 
Luna , however , stood limply by the side of her captor , gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings . 
Harry looked back at Umbridge , who was watching him closely . 
He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy entered the room , closely followed by Snape . 
" You wanted to see me , Headmistress ? " said Snape , looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference . 
" Yes , I would like another bottle of Veritaserum , as quick as you can , please . " 
" Surely you did not use it all ? 
I told you that three drops would be sufficient . " 
" It takes a full moon - cycle to mature , so I should have it ready for you in around a month . " 
" A month ? 
But I need it this evening , Snape ! 
I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown ! " 
" Really ? " said Snape , showing his first , faint sign of interest as he looked round at Harry . 
Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules . " 
His cold , dark eyes were boring into Harry's , who met his gaze unflinchingly , concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream , willing Snape to read it in his mind , to understand … 
" I wish to interrogate him ! " repeated Umbridge angrily , and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face . 
" I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth ! " 
" I have already told you , " said Snape smoothly , " that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum . 
Unless you wish to poison Potter - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did - I cannot help you . 
Snape looked back at Harry , who stared at him , frantic to communicate without words . 
Voldemort's got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries , he thought desperately . Voldemort's got Sirius - 
" You are on probation ! " 
shrieked Professor Umbridge , and Snape looked back at her , his eyebrows slightly raised . 
Now get out of my office ! " 
Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave . 
Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door . 
" Padfoot ? " cried Professor Umbridge , looking eagerly from Harry to Snape . 
" What is Padfoot ? 
What does he mean , Snape ? " 
Snape looked round at Harry . 
His face was inscrutable . 
Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not , but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge . 
" I have no idea , " said Snape coldly . 
" Potter , when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage . 
And Crabbe , loosen your hold a little . 
If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job . " 
He closed the door behind him with a snap , leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before : Snape had been his very last hope . 
He looked at Umbridge , who seemed to be feeling the same way ; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration . 
" Very well , " she said , and she pulled out her wand . 
She seemed to be talking herself into something . 
She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot , staring at Harry , beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily . 
" You are forcing me , Potter … I do not want to , " said Umbridge , still moving restlessly on the spot , " but sometimes circumstances justify the use … I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice . " 
Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face . 
" No ! " shrieked Hermione . 
" Professor Umbridge - it's illegal . " 
There was a nasty , eager , excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before . 
She raised her wand . 
" The Minister wouldn't want you to break the law , Professor Umbridge ! " cried Hermione . 
" What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him , " said Umbridge , who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry's body in turn , apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most . 
" He never knew I ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer , but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him , all the same . " 
" It was you ! " gasped Harry . 
" They were all bleating about silencing you somehow - discrediting you - but I was the one who actually did something about it … only you wriggled out of that one , didn't you , Potter ? 
Not today though , not now - " And taking a deep breath , she cried , " Cruc — " 
" NO ! " shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode . 
" No - Harry - we ' ll have to tell her ! " 
" No way ! " yelled Harry , staring at the little of Hermione he could see . 
" We ' ll have to , Harry , she ' ll force it out of you anyway , what's … what's the point ? " 
And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode's robes . 
Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted . 
Come on then , girl , come on ! " 
" Er - my - nee - no ! " shouted Ron through his gag . 
Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before . 
Neville , still choking for breath , was gazing at her , too . 
But Harry had just noticed something . 
Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands , there was no trace of a tear . 
" I'm - I'm sorry everyone , " said Hermione . 
" But - I can't stand it - " 
" That's right , that's right , girl ! " said Umbridge , seizing Hermione by the shoulders , thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her . 
" Well , " gulped Hermione into her hands , " well , he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore . " 
Fortunately , the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs . 
" Dumbledore ? " said Umbridge eagerly . 
" You know where Dumbledore is , then ? " 
" We ' ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog's Head - " 
wailed Hermione , holding her hands more tightly over her face , not , Harry knew , out of anguish , but to disguise the continued absence of tears . 
" What was it you wanted to tell him ? " 
" What's ready ? " demanded Umbridge , and now she grabbed Hermione's shoulders again and shook her slightly . 
" What's ready , girl ? " 
" The … the weapon , " said Hermione . 
" Weapon ? Weapon ? " said Umbridge , and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement . 
A weapon you could use against the Ministry ? 
On Professor Dumbledore's orders , of course ? " 
" Y — y - yes , " gasped Hermione , " but he had to leave before it was finished and n - n - now we ' ve finished it for him , and we c - c - can't find him t - t - to tell him ! " 
" What kind of weapon is it ? " said Umbridge harshly , her stubby hands still tight on Hermione's shoulders . 
Umbridge straightened up , looking exultant . 
" Lead me to the weapon , " she said . 
" I'm not showing … them , " said Hermione shrilly , looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers . 
" Fine … let them see it , I hope they use it on you ! 
In fact , I wish you'd invite loads and loads of people to come and see ! Th - that would serve you right - oh , I'd love it if the wh - whole school knew where it was , and how to u - use it , and then if you annoy any of them they ' ll be able to s - sort you out ! " 
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge : she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad , her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy , who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face . 
Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment , then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice . 
" All right , dear , let's make it just you and me … and we ' ll take Potter , too , shall we ? Get up , now . " 
" Professor , " said Malfoy eagerly , " Professor Umbridge , I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after - " 
" I am a fully qualified Ministry official , Malfoy , do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone ? " 
" In any case , it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see . 
You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these - " she gestured around at Ron , Ginny , Neville and Luna " - escape . " 
" All right , " said Malfoy , looking sulky and disappointed . 
" And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way " said Umbridge , pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand . 
" Lead on . " 
Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning , or even whether she had a plan . 
He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge's office , knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going . 
He did not dare attempt to talk to her ; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing . 
Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall . 
The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall - it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner , celebrating the end of exams , not a care in the world … 
Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air . 
The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now , and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass - Umbridge jogging to keep up - their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks . 
" It's hidden in Hagrid's hut , is it ? " said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear . 
" Of course not , " said Hermione scathingly . 
" Yes , he would have done , of course , the great half - breed oaf . " 
She laughed . 
Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat , but resisted . 
His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white - hot , as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill . 
" Then … where is it ? " 
asked Umbridge , with a hint of uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride towards the Forest . 
" It had to be somewhere that students weren't going to find it accidentally , didn't it ? " 
" Of course … very well , then … you two stay ahead of me . " 
Harry asked her . 
As they reached the cool shade of the first trees , Harry tried to catch Hermiones eye ; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening . 
She , however , merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees , moving at such a pace that Umbridge , with her shorter legs , had difficulty in keeping up . 
" Oh yes , " said Hermione , " yes , it's well hidden . " 
Harry's misgivings increased . 
Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp , but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog . 
Hermione had not been with him on that occasion ; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it . 
" Er - are you sure this is the right way ? " he asked her pointedly . 
" Oh yes , " she said in a steely voice , crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise . 
Neither of them paused to help her up again ; Hermione merely strode on , calling loudly over her shoulder , " It's a bit further in ! " 
" I want us heard , " she answered quietly , as Umbridge jogged noisily after them . 
" You ' ll see … " 
They walked on for what seemed a long time , until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light . 
Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest , one of being watched by unseen eyes . 
demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him . 
" Not far now ! " shouted Hermione , as they emerged into a dim , dank clearing . 
" Just a little bit - " 
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head . 
The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves ; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling ; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield - 
He wrenched himself free of her and turned . 
Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side , their bows raised and loaded , pointing at Harry Hermione and Umbridge . 
They backed slowly into the center of the clearing , Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror . 
Harry looked sideways at Hermione . 
" Who are you ? " said a voice . 
Harry looked left . 
The chestnut - bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out of the circle : his bow , like those of the others , was raised . 
On Harry's right , Umbridge was still whimpering , her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur . 
" I asked you who are you , human , " said Magorian rou ghly . 
" Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts ! " 
" You are from the Ministry of Magic ? " said Magorian , as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly . 
" That's right ! " said Umbridge , in an even higher voice , " so be very careful ! 
By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , any attack by half - breeds such as yourselves on a human - " 
" What did you call us ? " shouted a wild - looking black centaur , whom Harry recognized as Bane . 
Hermione said furiously , but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her . 
" ' Near - human intelligence ' ? " repeated Magorian , as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground . 
" What are you doing in our Forest ? " 
bellowed the hard - faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the Forest . 
" Why are you here ? " 
" I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land - " 
An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing : she let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head , while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously . 
The sound of their wild , neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving . 
" Be quiet ! " shouted Hermione , but it was too late : Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed , " Incarcerous ! " 
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes , wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur's torso and trapping his arms : he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs , attempting to free himself , while the other centaurs charged . 
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground ; face down on the Forest floor , he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him , but the centaurs leapt over and around them , bellowing and screaming with rage . 
Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to Stun one of them ; then she screamed very loudly . 
Lifting his head a few inches , Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air , wriggling and yelling with fright . 
Her wand fell from her hand to the ground , and Harry's heart leapt . 
If he could just reach it - 
But as he stretched out a hand towards it , a centaur's hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half . 
Over the plunging , many - colored backs and heads of the centaurs , Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane . 
Screaming non - stop , her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them . 
" They are young , " said a slow , doleful voice from behind Harry . 
" We do not attack foals . " 
He shook Harry by the neck of his robes . 
We only came in here because we hoped you'd drive her off for us . " 
Harry knew at once , from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding Hermione , that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this . 
The grey centaur threw back his head , his back legs stamping furiously , and bellowed , " You see , Ronan ? 
They already have the arrogance of their kind ! 
We were to act as your servants , drive away your enemies like obedient hounds ? " 
" No ! " said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak . 
" Please - I didn't mean that ! 
I just hoped you'd be able to - to help us - " 
But she seemed to be going from bad to worse . 
" We do not help humans ! " 
snarled the centaur holding Harry , tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time , so that Harry's feet left the ground momentarily . 
" We are a race apart and proud to be so . 
We will not permit you to walk from here , boasting that we did your bidding ! " 
" We're not going to say anything like that ! " Harry shouted . 
" We know you didn't do what you did because we wanted you to - " 
But nobody seemed to be listening to him . 
A bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted , " They came here unasked , they must pay the consequences ! " 
A roar of approval met these words and a dun - colored centaur shouted , " They can join the woman ! " 
" We haven't done anything to hurt you , we haven't used wands or threats , we just want to go back to school , please let us go back - " 
" We are not all like the traitor Firenze , human girl ! " shouted the grey centaur , to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows . 
We do not recognize your laws , we do not acknowledge your superiority , we are - " 
But they did not hear what else centaurs were , for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them , Harry , Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing , looked around . 
Harry's centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows . 
Hermione had been dropped , too , and Harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap . 
The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind ; the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired , all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches . 
Grawp's lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly ; they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half - light , his dull sludgecolored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet . 
He opened his mouth even wider . 
" Hagger . " 
Harry did not know what ' hagger ' meant , or what language it was from , nor did he much care ; he was watching Grawp's feet , which were almost as long as Harry's whole body . 
Hermione gripped his arm tightly ; the centaurs were quite silent , staring up at the giant , whose huge , round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped . 
" Hagger ! " he said again , more insistently . 
" Harry ! " she whispered . 
" I think he's trying to say ' Hagrid ' ! " 
At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them , the only two humans in a sea of centaurs . 
He lowered his head another foot or so , staring intently at them . 
Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said , in a deep , rumbling voice , " Hermy . " 
" Goodness , " said Hermione , gripping Harry's arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint , " he - he remembered ! " 
" HERMY ! " roared Grawp . 
" I'm sorry , Grawp , I don't know ! " 
" GRAWP WANT HAGGER ! " 
One of the giant's massive hands reached down . 
Hermione let out a real scream , ran a few steps backwards and fell over . 
Devoid of a wand , Harry braced himself to punch , kick , bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a snow - white centaur off his legs . 
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp's outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant , peppering his enormous face , causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up , rubbing his face with his enormous hands , breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper . 
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way ; pebble - sized droplets of Grawp's blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees . 
Once there they looked back ; Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his face ; they were retreating in disorder , galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing . 
" Oh no , " said Hermione , quaking so badly that her knees gave way . 
And he might kill them all . " 
" I'm not that fussed , to be honest , " said Harry bitterly . 
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter . 
As Harry listened to them , his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him . 
Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever . 
" Really smart plan . 
" We need to get back up to the castle , " said Hermione faintly . 
" By the time we ' ve done that , Sirius ' ll probably be dead ! " said Harry , kicking a nearby tree in temper . 
A high - pitched chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him . 
" Anyway , Harry , how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London ? " 
" Yeah , we were just wondering that , " said a familiar voice from behind her . 
Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees . 
Ron came into sight , closely followed by Ginny , Neville and Luna . 
All of them looked a little the worse for wear - there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny's cheek ; a large purple lump was swelling above Neville's right eye ; Ron's lip was bleeding worse than ever - but all were looking rather pleased with themselves . 
" So , " said Ron , pushing aside a low - hanging branch and holding out Harry's wand , " had any ideas ? " 
asked Harry in amazement , taking his wand from Ron . 
Anyway , we saw you out of the window heading into the Forest and followed . 
" She got carried away , " said Harry . 
" No , they got chased off by Grawp , " said Harry 
" Who's Grawp ? " Luna asked interestedly . 
" Anyway , never mind that now . 
Harry , what did you find out in the fire ? 
" Yes , " said Harry , as his scar gave another painful prickle , " and I'm sure Sirius is still alive , but I can't see how we ' re going to get there to help him . " 
" Well , we ' ll have to fly , won't we ? " said Luna , in the closest thing to a matter - of - fact voice Harry had ever heard her use . 
" I ' ve got a broom ! " said Ginny . 
" Excuse me , but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do ! " said Ginny , her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking . 
" Yeah , but - " 
And this is the first chance we ' ve had to do something real - or was that all just a game or something ? " 
" No — of course it wasn't - " said Harry impatiently . 
" Then we should come too , " said Neville simply . 
" We want to help . " 
" That's right , " said Luna , smiling happily . 
Harry's eyes met Ron's . 
He knew Ron was thinking exactly what he was : if he could have chosen any members of the D . A . , in addition to himself , Ron and Hermione , to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius , he would not have picked Ginny , Neville or Luna . 
" Well , it doesn't matter , anyway , " said Harry through gritted teeth , " because we still don't know how to get there - " 
" I s ' pose we ' re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is ? " Ron demanded . 
" The Crumple - Horned Snorkack can't fly , " said Luna in a dignified voice , " but they can , and Hagrid says they ' re very good at finding places their riders are looking for . " 
Harry whirled round . 
Standing between two trees , their white eyes gleaming eerily , were two Thestrals , watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word . 
They tossed their reptilian heads , throwing back long black manes , and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck ; how could he ever have thought them ugly ? 
" Is it those mad horse things ? " said Ron uncertainly , staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" How many ? " 
" Just two . " 
" Four , Hermione , " said Ginny , scowling . 
" I think there are six of us , actually , " said Luna calmly , counting . 
" Look , you three - " he pointed at Neville , Ginny and Luna , " you ' re not involved in this , you ' re not - " 
" Okay , fine , it's your choice , " he said curtly , " but unless we can find more Thestrals you ' re not going to be able - " 
" Oh , more of them will come , " said Ginny confidently , who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction , apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses . 
" What makes you think that ? " 
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve , which was damp with Grawp's blood . 
" Okay , then , " he said , a bright idea occurring , " Ron and I will take these two and go ahead , and Hermione can stay here with you three and she ' ll attract more Thestrals - " 
" I'm not staying behind ! " said Hermione furiously . 
Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral , placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horses silken back . 
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure , then looked around at the others . 
Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back . 
Luna was already in place , sitting side - saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day . 
Ron , Hermione and Ginny , however , were still standing motionless on the spot , open - mouthed and staring . 
" What ? " he said . 
" How ' re we supposed to get on ? " said Ron faintly . 
" When we can't see the things ? " 
" Oh , it's easy , " said Luna , sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him , Hermione and Ginny . 
" Come here … " 
She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount . 
All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed . 
" Mad … if I could just see it - " 
" We all ready , then ? " 
He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed . 
" Ministry of Magic , visitors ' entrance , London , then , " he said uncertainly . 
" Er … if you know … where to go … " 
For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all ; then , with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him , the wings on either side extended ; the horse crouched slowly , then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump . 
He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horse's silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood - red sunset . 
Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast : the Thestral streaked over the castle , its wide wings hardly beating ; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face ; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind , he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him , each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream . 
They were over the Hogwarts grounds , they had passed Hogsmeade ; Harry could see mountains and gullies below them . 
As the daylight began to fail , Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages , then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills … 
" This is bizarre ! " 
Twilight fell : the sky was turning to a light , dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars , and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were , or how very fast they were traveling . 
Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horses neck as he willed it to go even faster . 
How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor ? 
How much longer would Sinus be able to resist Voldemort ? 
All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted , nor died , for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body , making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr . Weasley was attacked . 
On they flew through the gathering darkness ; Harry's face felt stiff and cold , his legs numb from gripping the Thestrals sides so tightly , but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip … he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears , and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind . 
He had lost all sense of how far they had come ; all his faith was in the beast beneath him , still streaking purposefully through the night , barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards . 
If they were too late … 
He's still alive , he's still fighting , I can feel it … 
I'd know … 
Harrys stomach gave a jolt ; the Thestrals head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck . 
They were descending at last … he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously , but could see no sign of a falling body … presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction , just as he had . 
Quite suddenly , it seemed , they were hurtling towards the pavement ; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength , braced for a sudden impact , but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back , looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box , both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights . 
Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement . 
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him : both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron , though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground ; Neville jumped down , shaking ; and Luna dismounted smoothly . 
" Where do we go from here , then ? " she asked Harry in a politely interested voice , as though this was all a rather interesting day - trip . 
" Over here , " he said . 
He gave his Thestral a quick , grateful pat , then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door . 
" Come on ! " he urged the others , as they hesitated . 
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently ; Hermione , Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them ; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals , now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip , then forced himself into the box after Luna . 
Ron did it , his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial ; as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box . 
" Welcome to the Ministry of Magic . 
Please state your name and business . " 
" Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , Hermione Granger , " Harry said very quickly , " Ginny Weasley , Neville Longbottom , Luna Lovegood … we ' re here to save someone , unless your Ministry can do it first ! " 
" Thank you , " said the cool female voice . 
" Visitors , please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes . " 
Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head ; he glanced at the topmost one , Harry Potter , Rescue Mission . 
" Visitors to the Ministry , you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk , which is located at the far end of the Atrium . " 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows ; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight ; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic . 
Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium , but it seemed to be completely empty . 
The light was dimmer than it had been by day ; there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls , but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling . 
" The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening , " said the woman's voice . 
The door of the telephone box burst open ; Harry toppled out of it , closely followed by Neville and Luna . 
The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain , where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard , the point of the centaur's arrow , the tip of the goblin's hat and the house - elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool . 
" Come on , " said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall , Harry in the lead , past the fountain towards the desk where the security man who had weighed Harry's wand had sat , and which was now deserted . 
Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there , sure that their absence was an ominous sign , and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts . 
He pressed the nearest'down ' button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately , the golden grilles slid apart with a great , echoing clanking and they dashed inside . 
Harry stabbed the number nine button ; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend , jangling and rattling . 
Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with Mr . Weasley ; he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building , yet when the lift halted , the cool female voice said , " Department of Mysteries , " and the grilles slid open . 
They stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches , flickering in the rush of air from the lift . 
Harry turned towards the plain black door . 
After months and months of dreaming about it , he was here at last . 
" Let's go , " he whispered , and he led the way down t he corridor , Luna right behind him , gazing around with her mouth slightly open . 
" Okay , listen , " said Harry stopping again within six feet of the door . 
" Maybe … maybe a couple of people should stay here as a — as a lookout , and — " 
" We're coming with you , Harry , " said Neville . 
" Let's get on with it , " said Ron firmly . 
Harry still did not want to take them all with him , but it seemed he had no choice . 
He turned to face the door and walked forwards … just as it had in his dream , it swung open and he marched over the threshold , the others at his heels . 
They were standing in a large , circular room . 
Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling ; identical , unmarked , handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls , interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue ; their cool , shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot . 
" Someone shut the door , " Harry muttered . 
Without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them , the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor . 
In his dream , Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on . 
But there were around a dozen doors here . 
Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him , trying to decide which was the right one , there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways . 
The circular wall was rotating . 
Hermione grabbed Harry's arm as though frightened the floor might move , too , but it did not . 
For a few seconds , the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around ; then , quite as suddenly as it had started , the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again . 
Harry's eyes had blue streaks burned into them ; it was all he could see . 
" What was that about ? " whispered Ron fearfully . 
" I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through , " said Ginny in a hushed voice . 
Harry realized at once she was right : he could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant on the jet - black floor ; and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them . 
" Well , that doesn't matter now , " said Harry forcefully , blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision , and clutching his wand tighter than ever , " we won't need to get out till we ' ve found Sirius - " 
Hermione said urgently ; but Harry had never needed her advice less , his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible . 
" Where do we go , then , Harry ? " Ron asked . 
" I don't - " Harry began . 
He swallowed . 
" In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room - that's this one - and then I went through another door into a room that kind of … glitters . 
We should try a few doors , " he said hastily , " I ' ll know the right way when I see it . 
He marched straight at the door now facing him , the others following close behind him , set his left hand against its cool , shining surface , raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened , and pushed . 
After the darkness of the first room , the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter , though there were no glittering , shimmering lights as Harry had seen in his dreams . 
The place was quite empty except for a few desks and , in the very middle of the room , an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid , big enough for all of them to swim in ; a number of pearly - white objects were drifting around lazily in it . 
" What ' re those things ? " 
whispered Ron . 
" Dunno , " said Harry . 
" Are they fish ? " 
" Aquavirius Maggots ! " said Luna excitedly . 
" No , " said Hermione . 
She moved forward to look through the side of the tank . 
" Yes … I wonder what they ' re doing with them ? " 
Harry joined her at the tank . 
Glimmering eerily , they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid , looking something like slimy cauliflowers . 
" Let's get out of here , " said Harry . 
" This isn't right , we need to try another door . " 
" There are doors here , too , " said Ron , pointing around the walls . 
Harry's heart sank ; how big was this place ? 
" In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one , " he said . 
" I think we should go back and try from there . " 
So they hurried back into the dark , circular room ; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry's eyes instead of the blue candle flames . 
" Wait ! " said Hermione sharply , as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them . 
" Flagrate ! " 
She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery ' X ' appeared on the door . 
No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling , and once again the wall began to revolve very fast , but now there was a great red - gold blur in amongst the faint blue and , when all became still again , the fiery cross still burned , showing the door they had already tried . 
" Good thinking , " said Harry . 
Again , he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open , his wand still raised , the others at his heels . 
This room was larger than the last , dimly lit and rectangular , and the center of it was sunken , forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep . 
They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre , or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot . 
Instead of a chained chair , however , there was a raised stone dais in the center of the pit , on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient , cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing . 
Unsupported by any surrounding wall , the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which , despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air , was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched . 
" Who's there ? " said Harry , jumping down on to the bench below . 
There was no answering voice , but the veil continued to flutter and sway . 
" Careful ! " whispered Hermione . 
Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit . 
The pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when he'd been looking down on it from above . 
" Sirius ? " Harry spoke again , but more quietly now that he was nearer . 
He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway . 
Gripping his wand very tightly , he edged around the dais , but there was nobody there ; all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil . 
" Let's go , " called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps . 
" This isn't right , Harry , come on , let's go . " 
She sounded scared , much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam , yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it , old though it was . 
The gently rippling veil intrigued him ; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it . 
" Harry , let's go , okay ? " said Hermione more forcefully . 
He had just heard something . 
There were faint whispering , murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil . 
" What are you saying ? " he said , very loudly , so that his words echoed all around the stone benches . 
" Someone's whispering behind there , " he said , moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil . 
" Is that you , Ron ? " 
" I'm here , mate , " said Ron , appearing around the side of the archway . 
Harry demanded , for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder ; without really meaning to put it there , he found his foot was on the dais . 
" I can hear them too , " breathed Luna , joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil . 
Harry , stop it , come away - " 
She grabbed his arm and pulled , but he resisted . 
" Harry , we are supposed to be here for Sirius ! " she said in a high - pitched , strained voice . 
" Yeah … " 
Something finally slid back into place in his brain ; Sirius , captured , bound and tortured , and he was staring at this archway … 
He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil . 
" Let's go , " he said . 
" That's what I ' ve been trying to - well , come on , then ! " said Hermione , and she led the way back around the dais . 
On the other side , Ginny and Neville were staring , apparently entranced , at the veil too . 
Without speaking , Hermione took hold of Ginny's arm , Ron grabbed Neville's , and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door . 
" What d ' you reckon that arch was ? " Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room . 
" I don't know , but whatever it was , it was dangerous , " she said firmly , again inscribing a fiery cross on the door . 
Once more , the wall span and became still again . 
Harry approached another door at random and pushed . 
It did not move . 
" What's wrong ? " said Hermione . 
" It's … locked … " said Harry , throwing his weight at the door , but it didn't budge . 
" This is it , then , isn't it ? " said Ron excitedly , joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open . 
" Bound to be ! " 
" Get out of the way ! " said Hermione sharply . 
She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said , " Alohomora ! " 
Nothing happened . 
" Sirius's knife ! " said Harry . 
He pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall . 
What was more , when Harry looked down at the knife , he saw the blade had melted . 
" But what if that's the one ? " said Ron , staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing . 
" It can't be , Harry could get through all the doors in his dream , " said Hermione , marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now - useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket . 
" You know what could be in there ? " said Luna eagerly , as the wall started to spin yet again . 
" Something blibbering , no doubt , " said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh . 
The wall slid to a halt and Harry , with a feeling of increasing desperation , pushed the next door open . 
" This is it ! " 
He knew it at once by the beautiful , dancing , diamond - sparkling light . 
As Harrys eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare , he saw clocks gleaming from every surface , large and small , grandfather and carriage , hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room , so that a busy , relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule , marching footsteps . 
The source of the dancing , diamond - bright light was a towering crystal ball jar that stood at the far end of the room . 
" This way ! " 
Harry's heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track ; he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks , heading , as he had done in his dream , for the source of the light , the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing , glittering wind . 
" Oh , look ! " said Ginny , as they drew nearer , pointing at the very heart of the bell jar . 
As it rose in the jar , it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged , which was carried to the very top of the jar , but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again , and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg . 
" Keep going ! " said Harry sharply , because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird . 
" You dawdled enough by that old arch ! " she said crossly , but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it . 
" This is it , " Harry said again , and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech , " it's through here - " 
He glanced around at them all ; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious . 
He looked back at the door and pushed . 
They were there , they had found the place : high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small , dusty , glass orbs . 
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle - brackets set at intervals along the shelves . 
The room was very cold . 
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves . 
" You said it was row ninety - seven , " whispered Hermione . 
" Yeah , " breathed Harry , looking up at the end of the closest row . 
Beneath the branch of blueglowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure fifty - three . 
" We need to go right , I think , " whispered Hermione , squinting to the next row . 
They crept forward , glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves , the further ends of which were in near - total darkness . 
They passed row eighty - four … eighty - five … Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement , but Sirius might be gagged now , or else unconscious … or , said an unbidden voice inside his head , he might already be dead … 
" Ninety - seven ! " whispered Hermione . 
They stood grouped around the end of the row , gazing down the alley beside it . 
" He's right down at the end , " said Harry , whose mouth had become slightly dry . 
" He should be near here , " whispered Harry , convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor . 
" Harry ? " said Hermione tentatively , but he did not want to respond . 
His mouth was very dry . 
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight . 
" Or maybe … " He hurried to look down the one beyond that . 
" Harry ? " said Hermione again . 
" What ? " he snarled . 
" I … I don't think Sirius is here . " 
Harry did not want to look at any of them . 
He felt sick . 
He did not understand why Sirius was not here . 
He had to be here . 
He ran up the space at the end of the rows , staring down them . 
There was no sign of Sirius anywhere , nor any hint of a struggle . 
" Harry ? " Ron called . 
" What ? " 
He did not want to hear what Ron had to say ; did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts , but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others ' accusing stares … 
" Have you seen this ? " said Ron , 
" What ? " said Harry , but eagerly this time - it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there , a clue . 
He strode back to where they were all standing , a little way down row ninety - seven , but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf . 
" What ? " Harry repeated glumly . 
" It's — it's got your name on , " said Ron . 
Harry moved a little closer . 
Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light , though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years . 
" My name ? " said Harry blankly . 
He stepped forwards . 
Not as tall as Ron , he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball . 
S . P . T . to A . P . W . B . D . 
Dark Lord and ( ? ) Harry Potter 
Harry stared at it . 
" What is it ? " 
He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf . 
" I'm not here , " he said , sounding perplexed . 
" None of the rest of us are here . " 
" Harry , I don't think you should touch it , " said Hermione sharply , as he stretched out his hand . 
" Why not ? " he said . 
" Don't , Harry , " said Neville suddenly . 
Harry looked at him . 
" It's got my name on , " said Harry . 
He had expected it to feel cold , but it did not . 
On the contrary , it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours , as though the glow of light within was warming it . 
Expecting , even hoping , that something dramatic was going to happen , something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile after all , Harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it . 
The others moved in closer around Harry , gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust . 
And then , from right behind them , a drawling voice spoke . 
" Very good , Potter . 
Now turn around , nice and slowly , and give that to me . " 
" To me , " said Malfoy yet again . 
" Where's Sirius ? " 
Harry said . 
Several of the Death Eaters laughed ; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly , " The Dark Lord always knows ! " 
" Now , give me the prophecy Potter . " 
" I want to know where Sirius is ! " 
" I want to know where Sirius is ! " mimicked the woman to his left . 
She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others , the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes . 
" You ' ve got him , " said Harry , ignoring the rising panic in his chest , the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety - seventh row . 
" He's here . 
I know he is . " 
Harry felt Ron stir beside him . 
" Don't do anything , " Harry muttered . 
" Not yet - " 
" Oh , you don't know Potter as I do , Bellatrix , " said Malfoy softly . 
" He has a great weakness for heroics ; the Dark Lord understands this about him . 
Now give me the prophecy , Potter . " 
" I know you ' ve got him ! " 
More of the Death Eaters laughed , though the woman laughed loudest of all . 
" It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams , Potter , " said Malfoy . 
" Go on , then , " said Harry , raising his own wand to chest height . 
As he did so , the five wands of Ron , Hermione , Neville , Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him . 
The knot in Harry's stomach tightened . 
If Sirius really was not here , he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all … 
But the Death Eaters did not strike . 
" Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt , " said Malfoy coolly . 
It was Harry's turn to laugh . 
" Yeah , right ! " he said . 
" I give you this - prophecy , is it ? 
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked : " Accio proph — " 
before she had finished her spell , and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it . 
" Oh , he knows how to play , little bitty baby Potter , " she said , her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood . 
" If you smash it - ! " 
Harry's mind was racing . 
The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun - glass sphere . 
He had no interest in it . 
He just wanted to get them all out of this alive , to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity … 
The woman stepped forward , away from her fellows , and pulled off her hood . 
Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face , making it gaunt and skull - like , but it was alive with a feverish , fanatical glow . 
I ' ll do it . " 
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny ; he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her , the prophecy held up to his chest . 
" You ' ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us , " he told Bellatrix . 
" I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it , will he ? " 
She did not move ; she merely stared at him , the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth . 
" So , " said Harry , " what kind of prophecy are we talking about , anyway ? " 
He could not think what to do but to keep talking . 
Neville's arm was pressed against his , and he could feel him shaking ; he could feel one of the others ' quickened breath on the back of his head . 
He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this , because his mind was blank . 
" What kind of prophecy ? " 
repeated Bellatrix , the grin fading from her face . 
" You jest , Harry Potter . " 
" Nope , not jesting , " said Harry , his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater , looking for a weak link , a space through which they could escape . 
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses . 
" You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips , you dare besmirch it with your half - blood's tongue , you dare - " 
" Did you know he's a half - blood too ? " said Harry recklessly . 
Yeah , his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle - or has he been telling you lot he's pure - blood ? " 
" NO ! " 
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand , but Malfoy had deflected it ; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered . 
Two figures , pearly - white as ghosts , fluid as smoke , unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak ; their voices vied with each other , so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts . 
" … at the solstice will come a new … " said the figure of an old , bearded man . 
Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor . 
The problem was going to be conveying it to the others . 
" Do not play games with us , Potter , " said Malfoy . 
" I'm not playing games , " said Harry , half his mind on the conversation , half on his wandering foot . 
A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermiones . 
" What ? " she whispered . 
" Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries ? " 
" I - what ? " said Harry . 
And for a moment he quite forgot his plan . 
" What about my scar ? " 
" What ? " whispered Hermione more urgently behind him . 
" Dumbledore never told you ? " Malfoy repeated . 
" Well , this explains why you didn't come earlier , Potter , the Dark Lord wondered why - " 
" - when I say now - " 
" Did he ? " said Harry . 
Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking , to distract the Death Eaters . 
" So he wanted me to come and get it , did he ? 
Why ? " 
" Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries , Potter , are those about whom it was made , as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him . " 
" And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me ? " 
" About both of you , Potter , about both of you … haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby ? " 
Harry stared into the slitted eye - holes through which Malfoy's grey eyes were gleaming . 
Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand ? 
" Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me ? " he said quietly , gazing at Lucius Malfoy , his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand . 
" And he's made me come and get it for him ? 
Why couldn't he come and get it himself ? " 
" The Dark Lord , walk into the Ministry of Magic , when they are so sweetly ignoring his return ? 
The Dark Lord , reveal himself to the Aurors , when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin ? " 
" So , he's got you doing his dirty work for him , has he ? " said Harry . 
" Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it - and Bode ? " 
" Very good , Potter , very good … " said Malfoy slowly . 
" But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell — " 
" NOW ! " yelled Harry . 
Five different voices behind him bellowed , " REDUCTO ! " 
Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit ; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart , pearly - white figures unfurled into the air and floated there , their voices echoing from who knew what long - dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor - 
" RUN ! " Harry yelled , as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above . 
He seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forwards , holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them . 
A Death Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face ; they were all yelling , there were cries of pain , and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves , weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres - 
Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron , Ginny and Luna sprint past him , their arms over their heads ; something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards ; a hand caught him by the shoulder ; he heard Hermione shout , " Stupefy ! " 
They were at the end of row ninety - seven ; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest ; he could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on ; straight ahead , the door through which they had come was ajar ; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar ; he pelted through the doorway , the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand , and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them - 
" Colloportus ! " gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise . 
" Where - where are the others ? " 
gasped Harry . 
He had thought Ron , Luna and Ginny were ahead of them , that they would be waiting in this room , but there was nobody there . 
" They must have gone the wrong way ! " whispered Hermione , terror in her face . 
" Listen ! " whispered Neville . 
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed ; Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar , " Leave Nott , leave him , I say — his injuries will be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy . 
Jugson , come back here , we need to organize ! 
We ' ll split into pairs and search , and don't forget , be gentle with Potter until we ' ve got the prophecy , you can kill the others if necessary - Bellatrix , Rodolphus , you take the left ; Crabbe , Rabastan , go right - Jugson , Dolohov , the door straight ahead - Macnair and Avery , through here - Rookwood , over there - Mulciber , come with me ! " 
" What do we do ? " Hermione asked Harry , trembling from head to foot . 
" Well , we don't stand here waiting for them to find us , for a start , " said Harry . 
They ran as quietly as they could , past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching , towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room . 
" Stand aside ! " said a rough voice . 
As the door flew open , Harry , Hermione and Neville dived under desks . 
They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters ' robes drawing nearer , their feet moving rapidly . 
" They might ' ve run straight through to the hall , " said the rough voice . 
" Check under the desks , " said another . 
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend ; poking his wand out from under the desk , he shouted , " STUPEFY ! " 
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater ; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over ; the second Death Eater , however , had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione , who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim . 
Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees , causing him to topple and his aim to go awry . 
Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help ; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair , he cried : 
" EXPELLIARMUS ! " 
Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy ; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them , the Death Eater in front , Harry hot on his heels , and Neville bringing up the rear , plainly horrorstruck by what he had done . 
" Get out of the way , Harry ! " yelled Neville , clearly determined to repair the damage . 
" STUPEFY ! " 
The jet of red light had flown right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass - fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour - glasses ; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart , glass flying everywhere , sprang back up on to the wall , fully mended , then fell down again , and shattered - 
The Death Eater had snatched up his wand , which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar . 
He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted : " STUP — " 
The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest : he froze , his arm still raised , his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar . 
Harry expected to hear a dunk , for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor , but instead , his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest , sprawled on his back on the table , with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind . 
" Accio wand ! " cried Hermione . 
Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him . 
" Thanks , " he said . 
He was staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar . 
All three of them raised their wands again , but none of them struck : they were all gazing , openmouthed , appalled , at what was happening to the man's head . 
It was shrinking very fast , growing balder and balder , the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull ; his cheeks becoming smooth , his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz … 
A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick , muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again ; but even as they watched , their mouths open , the head began to swell to its previous proportions again ; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin … 
" It's Time , " said Hermione in an awestruck voice . 
" Time … " 
The Death Eater shook his ugly head again , trying to clear it , but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more … 
There was a shout from a room nearby , then a crash and a scream . 
" Harry ! " Hermione screamed . 
The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar . 
Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm . 
" You can't hurt a baby ! " 
There was no time to argue the point ; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew , too late , that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position . 
" Come on ! " he said , and leaving the ugly baby - headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room , leading back into the black hallway . 
They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them ; veering left , he burst instead into a small , dark , cluttered office and slammed the door behind them . 
" Collo — " began Hermione , but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside . 
Harry , Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet ; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view ; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books ; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him , tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react . 
" Silencio ! " cried Hermione and the man's voice was extinguished . 
He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask , but no sound came out . 
He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater . 
" Petrificus Totalus ! " shouted Harry , as the second Death Eater raised his wand . 
His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards , face down on to the rug at Harry's feet , stiff as a board and unable to move . 
" Well done , Ha — " 
But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand ; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione's chest . 
She gave a tiny " Oh ! " as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor , where she lay motionless . 
" HERMIONE ! " 
Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk , his wand held up in front of him . 
The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged - his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face . 
Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled , clutching his mouth and nose . 
Harry twisted around , his own wand held high , and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry , who recognized the long , pale , twisted face from the Daily Prophet : Antonin Dolohov , the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts . 
Give me the prophecy , or you get the same as her … 
" Like you won't kill us all anyway , the moment I hand it over ! " said Harry . 
" Whaddever you do , Harry , " said Neville fiercely from under the desk , lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin , " don'd gib it to him ! " 
Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder - the baby - headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway , his head bawling , his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him . 
Harry seized his chance : 
" PETRIFICUS TOTALUS ! " 
The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade , both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch . 
" Hermione , " Harry said at once , shaking her as the baby - headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again . 
" Whad did he do to her ? " said Neville , crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side , blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose . 
" I dunno … " 
Neville groped for Hermione's wrist . 
" She's alive ? " 
" Yeah , I dink so . " 
There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps , but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby - headed Death Eater in the next room . 
" Neville , we ' re not far from the exit , " Harry whispered , " we ' re right next to that circular room … if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come , I ' ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift … then you could find someone … raise the alarm … " 
" And whad are you going do do ? " said Neville , mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry . 
" I ' ve got to find the others , " said Harry . 
" Well , I ' b going do find dem wid you , " said Neville firmly . 
" But Hermione — " 
He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms , glaring at Harry , who hesitated , then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders . 
" Wait , " said Harry , snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville's hand , " you'd better take this . " 
Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door . 
" My gran's going do kill be , " said Neville thickly , blood spattering from his nose as he spoke , " dat was by dad's old wand . " 
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously . 
The baby - headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things , toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks , bawling and confused , while the glass - fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time - Turners continued to fall , shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them . 
They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway , which now seemed completely deserted . 
They walked a few steps forwards , Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight ; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more . 
With a sinking heart , Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors . 
But before they could make a decision as to which way to try , a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it . 
" Ron ! " croaked Harry , dashing towards them . 
" Ginny - are you all - ? " 
" Harry , " said Ron , giggling weakly , lurching forwards , seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes , " there you are … ha ha ha … you look funny , Harry … you ' re all messed up … " 
Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth . 
Next moment his knees had given way , but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes , so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow . 
" Ginny ? " 
Harry said fearfully . 
" What happened ? " 
But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position , panting and holding her ankle . 
" I think her ankle's broken , I heard something crack , " whispered Luna , who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt . 
" Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets ; it was a very odd place , some of the time we were just floating in the dark - " 
" Harry , we saw Uranus up close ! " said Ron , still giggling feebly . 
" Get it , Harry ? 
We saw Uranus - ha ha ha - " 
A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst . 
" - anyway , one of them grabbed Ginny's foot , I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face , but … " 
Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny , who was breathing in a very shallow way , her eyes still closed . 
" And what about Ron ? " said Harry fearfully , as Ron continued to giggle , still hanging off the front of Harry's robes . 
" I don't know what they hit him with , " said Luna sadly , " but he's gone a bit funny , I could hardly get him along at all . " 
" Harry , " said Ron , pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly , " you know who this girl is , Harry ? 
She's Loony … Loony Lovegood … ha ha ha " 
" Luna , can you help Ginny ? " 
" Yes , " said Luna , sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping , then putting an arm around Ginnys waist and pulling her up . 
" It's only my ankle , I can do it myself ! " said Ginny impatiently , but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support . 
Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as , so many months ago , he had pulled Dudley's . 
He looked around : they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time - 
He heaved Ron towards a door ; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in , led by Bellatrix Lestrange . 
Stunning Spells shot across the room : Harry smashed his way through the door ahead , flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione : they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix . 
" Colloportus ! " shouted Harry , and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side . 
Harry span around ; they were back in the Brain Room and , sure enough , there were doors all around the walls . 
He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first . 
" Luna - Neville - help me ! " 
The three of them tore around the room , sealing the doors as they went ; Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door : 
There were footsteps running along behind the doors , every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one , so it creaked and shuddered ; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall - then , as Harry reached the very top of the room , he heard Luna cry : 
He turned in time to see her flying through the air ; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time ; Luna hit a desk , slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled , as still as Hermione . 
" Get Potter ! " shrieked Bellatrix , and she ran at him ; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room ; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy - 
" Hey ! " said Ron , who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry , giggling . 
" Hey Harry , there are brains in here , ha h a ha , isn't that weird , Harry ? " 
But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank . 
Harry , Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish : for a moment it seemed suspended in midair , then it soared towards Ron , spinning as it came , and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it , unraveling like rolls of film - 
" Ha ha ha , Harry , look at it - " said Ron , watching it disgorge its gaudy innards , " Harry come and touch it ; bet it's weird - " 
" RON , NO ! " 
Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain , but he was sure it would not be anything good . 
The moment they made contact with his skin , the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes . 
" Harry , look what's happen — No - no - I don't like it - no , stop - stop - " 
But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now ; he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body . 
" Diffindo ! " yelled Harry , trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes , but they would not break . 
" Harry , it ' ll suffocate him ! " screamed Ginny , immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor – then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face . 
" STUBEFY ! " shouted Neville , wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters , " STUBEFY , STUBEFY ! " 
But nothing happened . 
Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters , two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them . 
Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him : holding the prophecy high above his head , he sprinted back up the room ; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others . 
It seemed to have worked ; they streaked after him , knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy , and he dashed through the only door still open , the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come ; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him . 
He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish - 
The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters ' laughter : he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him , while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him . 
Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him : the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand , his wand clutched tightly in his right . 
The back of his legs hit something solid : he had reached the dais where the archway stood . 
" Potter , your race is run , " drawled Lucius Malfoy , pulling off his mask , " now hand me the prophecy like a good boy . " 
" Let - let the others go , and I ' ll give it to you ! " said Harry desperately . 
A few of the Death Eaters laughed . 
" You are not in a position to bargain , Potter , " said Lucius Malfoy , his pale face flushed with pleasure . 
Harry's heart sank : Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them , Hermiones wand held fast in his trembling hand . 
" Neville - no - go back to Ron - " 
" STUBEFY ! " Neville shouted again , pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn . 
" STUBEFY ! 
One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind , pinioning his arms to his sides . 
He struggled and kicked ; several of the Death Eaters laughed . 
" Well , your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause … your death will not come as a great shock . " 
" Longbottom ? " repeated Bellatrix , and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face . 
" No , no , no , " said Bellatrix . 
" No , let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents … unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy . " 
Bellatrix raised her wand . 
Neville screamed , his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground . 
The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor , twitching and screaming in agony . 
" That was just a taster ! " said Bellatrix , raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet . 
She turned and gazed up at Harry . 
Harry did not have to think ; there was no choice . 
Malfoy jumped forwards to take it . 
Then , high above them , two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room : Sirius , Lupin , Moody , Tonks and Kingsley . 
Malfoy turned , and raised his wand , but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him . 
Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact , but dived off the dais out of the way . 
The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order , who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor . 
Through the darting bodies , the flashes of light , Harry could see Neville crawling along . 
He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville . 
" Yes , " said Neville , trying to pull himself up . 
" I dink he's all righd - he was still fighding de brain when I lefd - " 
The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it , leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been only seconds before ; both scrambled away from the spot , then a thick arm came out of nowhere , seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright , so that his toes were barely touching the floor . 
" Give it to me , " growled a voice in his ear , " give me the prophecy - " 
Through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away ; Kingsley was fighting two at once ; Tonks , still halfway up the tiered seats , was firing spells down at Bellatrix - nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying . 
He turned his wand backwards towards the man's side , but had no breath to utter an incantation , and the man's free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy - 
" AARGH ! " 
Neville had come lunging out of nowhere ; unable to articulate a spell , he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eaters mask . 
" STUPEFY ! " 
The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off : it was Macnair , Buckbeak's would - be killer , one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot . 
" Thanks ! " Harry said to Neville , pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past , dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs ; then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped . 
For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy , but then he saw Moody's magical eye spinning away across the floor . 
Its owner was lying on his side , bleeding from the head , and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville : Dolohov , his long pale face twisted with glee . 
" Tarantallegra ! " he shouted , his wand pointing at Neville , whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap - dance , unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again . 
" Now , Potter - " 
Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife ; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville's jerking legs , but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell . 
Dolohov raised his wand again . 
" Accio proph — " 
The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling on to it . 
Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling , their wands flashing like swords , sparks flying from their wand - tips - 
Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione . 
Springing up , Harry yelled , " Petrificus Totalus ! " Once again , Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards , landing with a crash on his back . 
" Now I want you to get out of - " 
Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps , her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix , triumphant , running back towards the fray . 
" Harry , take the prophecy , grab Neville and run ! " Sirius yelled , dashing to meet Bellatrix . 
Harry did not see what happened next : Kingsley swayed across his field of vision , battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood ; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself towards Neville - 
" Can you stand ? " he bellowed in Neville's ear , as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably . 
Neville did so - Harry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction , they would not support him , and then , out of nowhere , a man lunged at them : both fell backwards , Neville's legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle's , Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed . 
" The prophecy , give me the prophecy , Potter ! " snarled Lucius Malfoy's voice in his ear , and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs . 
" No - get - off - me … Neville - catch it ! " 
Harry flung the prophecy across the floor , Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest . 
Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville , but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled , " Impedimenta ! " 
As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling . 
Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again , but before he could draw breath to strike , Lupin had jumped between them . 
" Harry , round up the others and GO ! " 
Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps ; Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight ; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step - 
A spell hit the stone bench at Harrys heel ; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below . 
Neville sank to the ground , his legs still jerking and thrashing , and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket . 
" Come on ! " said Harry desperately , hauling at Neville's robes . 
He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam - the small spun - glass ball dropped from his pocket and , before either of them could catch it , one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it : it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them . 
As both of them stared at the place where it had broken , appalled at what had happened , a pearly - white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air , unnoticed by any but them . 
Harry could see its mouth moving , but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them , not one word of the prophecy could he hear . 
" Harry , I ' b sorry ! " cried Neville , his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder . 
" I ' b so sorry , Harry , I didn'd bean do - " 
Harry shouted . 
" Just try and stand , let's get out of - " 
" Dubbledore ! " said Neville , his sweaty face suddenly transported , staring over Harry's shoulder . 
" What ? " 
" DUBBLEDORE ! " 
Harry turned to look where Neville was staring . 
Directly above them , framed in the doorway from the Brain Room , stood Albus Dumbledore , his wand aloft , his face white and furious . 
Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body - they were saved . 
Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry , who had no more thoughts of leaving . 
Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there and yelled to the others . 
One of the Death Eaters ran for it , scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite . 
Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line - 
Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light : he was laughing at her . 
" Come on , you can do better than that ! " he yelled , his voice echoing around the cavernous room . 
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest . 
The laughter had not quite died from his face , but his eyes widened in shock . 
Harry released Neville , though he was unaware of doing so . 
He was jumping down the steps again , pulling out his wand , as Dumbledore , too , turned towards the dais . 
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall : his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch . 
Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted , once - handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil , which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind , then fell back into place . 
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream , but knew it meant nothing - Sirius had only just fallen through the archway , he would reappear from the other side any second … 
But Sirius did not reappear . 
" SIRIUS ! " Harry yelled . 
" SIRIUS ! " 
Sirius must be just behind the curtain , he , Harry , would pull him back out … 
But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais , Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest , holding him back . 
" There's nothing you can do , Harry - " 
" Get him , save him , he's only just gone through ! " 
" - it's too late , Harry . " 
" There's nothing you can do , Harry … nothing … he's gone . " 
Harry yelled . 
He did not believe it ; he would not believe it ; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had . 
Lupin did not understand ; people hid behind that curtain ; Harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room . 
" SIRIUS ! " he bellowed . 
" SIRIUS ! " 
" He can't come back , Harry , " said Lupin , his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry . 
" He can't come back , because he's d - " 
" SIRIUS ! " 
To Harry it was meaningless noise , the deflected curses flying past them did not matter , nothing mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius - who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain - was not going to emerge at any moment , shaking back his dark hair and eager to re - enter the battle . 
Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais . 
Harry , still staring at the archway , was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting 
But some part of him realized , even as he fought to break free from Lupin , that Sirius had never kept him waiting before … Sirius had risked everything , always , to see Harry , to help him … if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it , the only possible explanation was that he could not come back … that he really was . 
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room , seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes ; Mad - Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay , and was attempting to revive her ; behind the dais there were still hashes of light , grunts and cries - Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius's duel with Bellatrix . 
" Harry ? " 
Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood . 
" Harry … I ' b really sorry … " said Neville . 
Harry nodded . 
" Here , " said Lupin quietly , and pointing his wand at Neville's legs he said , " Finite . " 
The spell was lifted : Neville's legs fell back to the floor and remained still . 
Lupin's face was pale . 
Where are they all , Neville ? " 
Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke . 
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais . 
Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain : Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around . 
He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it ; she was halfway up the steps now 
" SHE KILLED SIRIUS ! " bellowed Harry . 
The hem of Bellatrix's robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming … 
She aimed a curse over her shoulder . 
Harry was deluged in the foul - smelling potion within : the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long colored tentacles , but he shouted , " Wingardium Leviosa ! " and they flew off him up into the air . 
Slipping and sliding , he ran on towards the door ; he leapt over Luna , who was groaning on the floor , past Ginny , who said , " Harry - what - ? " , past Ron , who giggled feebly , and Hermione , who was still unconscious . 
He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room ; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts . 
He ran , but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating . 
Once more , he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra . 
" Where's the exit ? " he shouted desperately , as the wall rumbled to a halt again . 
" Where's the way out ? " 
The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask . 
The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him , torch - lit and empty . 
He ran … 
He could hear a lift clattering ahead ; he sprinted up the passageway , swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift . 
He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around . 
Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall , but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him . 
He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren : the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells . 
She had stopped running . 
" Come out , come out , little Harry ! " she called in her mock baby voice , which echoed off the polished wooden floors . 
" What did you come after me for , then ? 
I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin ! " 
" I am ! " shouted Harry , and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am ! 
I am ! 
I am ! all around the room 
" Aaaaaah … did you love him , little baby Potter ? " 
Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before ; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed , " Crucio ! " 
Bellatrix screamed : the spell had knocked her off her feet , but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had - she was already back on her feet , breathless , no longer laughing . 
Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again . 
Her counter - spell hit the head of the handsome wizard , which was blown off and landed twenty feet away , gouging long scratches into the wooden floor . 
" You need to mean them , Potter ! 
You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I ' ll show you how it is done , shall I ? I ' ll give you a lesson - " 
Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed , " Crucio ! " and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur's arm , holding its bow , span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard's head . 
" Potter , you cannot win against me ! " she cried . 
He could hear her moving to the right , trying to get a clear shot of him . 
He backed around the statue away from her , crouching behind the centaur's legs , his head level with the house - elf's . 
" I was and am the Dark Lord's most loyal servant . 
I learned the Dark Arts from him , and I know spells of such power that you , pathetic little boy , can never hope to compete " 
" Stupefy ! " yelled Harry . 
He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain . 
She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck . 
" Protego ! " 
Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin's ears went flying across the room . 
" Potter , I'm going to give you one chance ! " 
" Give me the prophecy - roll it out towards me now - and I may spare your life ! " 
" Well , you ' re going to have to kill me , because it's gone ! " 
Harry roared and , as he shouted it , pain seared across his forehead ; his scar was on fire again , and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage . 
" And he knows ! ' " said Harry , with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix's own . 
He's not going to be happy with you , is he ? " 
" What ? 
What do you mean ? " she cried , and for the first time there was fear in her voice . 
" The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps ! 
What do you think Voldemort ' ll say about that , then ? " 
" LIAR ! " she shrieked , but he could hear the terror behind the anger now . 
" YOU ' VE GOT IT , POTTER , AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME ! Accio prophecy ! 
ACCIO PROPHECY ! " 
Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her , the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst . 
He waved his empty hand from behind the one - eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him . 
It smashed and nobody heard what it said , tell your boss that ! " 
" Don't waste your breath ! " yelled Harry , his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar , now more terrible than ever . 
" He can't hear you from here ! " 
" Can't I , Potter ? " said a high , cold voice . 
Harry opened his eyes . 
Tall , thin and black - hooded , his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt , his scarlet , slit - pupilled eyes staring … Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall , his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen , quite unable to move . 
" So , you smashed my prophecy ? " said Voldemort softly , staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes . 
" No , Bella , he is not lying … I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind … months of preparation , months of effort … and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again " " Master , I am sorry I knew not , I was fighting the Animagus Black ! " sobbed Bellatrix , flinging herself down at Voldemort's feet as he paced slowly nearer . 
Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies ? " 
" But Master - he is here - he is below " 
" I have nothing more to say to you , Potter , " he said quietly . 
" You have irked me too often , for too long . 
AVADA KEDAVRA ! " 
Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist ; his mind was blank , his wand pointing uselessly at the floor . 
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive , leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort . 
The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry . 
" What - ? " cried Voldemort , staring around . 
And then he breathed , " Dumbledore ! " 
Harry looked behind him , his heart pounding . 
Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates . 
Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore , who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak . 
Next second , he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain . 
The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix , who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest , before it dived at her , pinning her to the floor . 
Meanwhile , the goblin and the house - elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one - armed centaur galloped at Voldemort , who vanished and reappeared beside the pool . 
The headless statue thrust Harry backwards , away from the fight , as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both . 
" It was foolish to come here tonight , Tom , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed , instead hitting the security guard's desk , which burst into flame . 
Dumbledore flicked his own wand : the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry , though shielded by his golden guard , felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it . 
" You do not seek to kill me , Dumbledore ? " called Voldemort , his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield . 
" We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man , Tom , " Dumbledore said calmly , continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world , as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall . 
" There is nothing worse than death , Dumbledore ! " snarled Voldemort . 
" You are quite wrong , " said Dumbledore , still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks . 
Harry felt scared to see him walking along , undefended , shieldless ; he wanted to cry out a warning , but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall , blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it . 
" Indeed , your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness " 
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield . 
This time it was the one - armed centaur , galloping in front of Dumbledore , that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces , but before the fragments had even hit the floor , Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip . 
A long thin flame flew from the tip ; it wrapped itself around Voldemort , shield and all . 
For a moment , it seemed Dumbledore had won , but then the fiery rope became a serpent , which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned , hissing furiously , to face Dumbledore . 
Voldemort vanished ; the snake reared from the floor , ready to strike . 
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared , standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood . 
" Look out ! " Harry yelled . 
But even as he shouted , another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake had struck . 
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore , opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole : he burst into flame and fell to the floor , small , wrinkled and flightless . 
At the same moment , Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long , fluid movement - the snake , which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him , flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke ; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass . 
Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool , slopping wildly over the sides , drenching the polished floor . 
Sure it was over , sure Voldemort had decided to flee , Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard , but Dumbledore bellowed : " Stay where you are , Harry ! " 
Harry could not see why : the hall was quite empty but for themselves , the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue , and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor 
And then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead : it was pain beyond imagining , pain past endurance . 
He was gone from the hall , he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes , so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature's began : they were fused together , bound by pain , and there was no escape 
And when the creature spoke , it used Harry's mouth , so that in his agony he felt his jaw move 
" If death is nothing , Dumbledore , kill the boy … " 
Let the pain stop , thought Harry … let him kill us … end it , Dumbledore … death is nothing compared to this … 
And I ' ll see Sirius again … 
And as Harry's heart filled with emotion , the creature's coils loosened , the pain was gone ; Harry was lying face down on the floor , his glasses gone , shivering as though he lay upon ice , not wood … 
And there were voices echoing through the hall , more voices than there should have been … Harry opened his eyes , saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him , but which now lay flat on its back , cracked and immobile . 
He put them on and raised his head a little to find Dumbledore's crooked nose inches from his own . 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry , shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly . 
The Atrium was full of people ; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall ; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them . 
As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet , Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house - elf and the goblin , leading a stunned - looking Cornelius Fudge forward . 
" He was there ! " shouted a scarlet - robed man with a ponytail , who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall , where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before . 
" I saw him , Mr . Fudge , I swear it was You - Know - Who , he grabbed a woman and Disapparated ! " 
" I know , Williamson , I know , I saw him too ! " gibbered Fudge , who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles . 
" If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore - apparently satisfied that Harry was all right , and walking forwards so that the newcomers realized he was there for the first time ( a few of them raised their wands ; others simply looked amazed ; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipperclad feet left the floor ) - " you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber , bound by an Anti - Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them . " 
" You - here - I - I " 
He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry , " Seize him ! " 
" Cornelius , I am ready to fight your men - and win , again ! " said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice . 
" But a few minutes ago you saw proof , with your own eyes , that I have been telling you the truth for a year . 
Lord Voldemort has returned , you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months , and it is time - you listened to sense ! " 
" I - don't – well " blustered Fudge , looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do . 
When nobody did , he said , " Very well - Dawlish ! Williamson ! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see … Dumbledore , you - you will need to tell me exactly - the Fountain of Magical Brethren - what happened ? " he added in a kind of whimper , staring around at the floor , where the remains of the statues of the witch , wizard and centaur now lay scattered . 
" We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts , " said Dumbledore . 
" Harry - Harry Potter ? " 
Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry , who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel . 
" He - here ? " said Fudge , goggling at Harry . 
" I shall explain everything , " repeated Dumbledore , " when Harry is back at school . " 
He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard's head lay on the floor . 
He pointed his wand at it and muttered , " Portus . " 
The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds , then became still once more . 
" Now see here , Dumbledore ! " said Fudge , as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it . 
You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic , you – you " 
His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half - moon spectacles . 
" You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts , " said Dumbledore . " You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work . 
I will give you … " Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed it … " half an hour of my time tonight , in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here . 
After that , I shall need to return to my school . 
If you need more help from me you are , of course , more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts . 
Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me . " 
Fudge goggled worse than ever ; his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair . 
" I - you " 
Dumbledore turned his back on him . 
" Take this Portkey , Harry . " 
He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand on it , past caring what he did next or where he went . 
" I shall see you in half an hour , " said Dumbledore quietly " One … two … three … " 
Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel . 
The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet ; the Atrium , Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of color and sound … 
Harry's feet hit solid ground ; his knees buckled a little and the golden wizard's head fell with a resounding dunk to the floor . 
He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledore's office . 
The delicate silver instruments stood once more on the spindle - legged tables , puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames , heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture . 
Harry looked through the window . 
The silence and the stillness , broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait , was unbearable to him . 
He walked around the quiet , beautiful office , breathing quickly , trying not to think . 
It was his fault Sirius had died ; it was all his fault . 
If he , Harry , had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort's trick , if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real , if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was , as Hermione had said , banking on Harry's love of playing the hero … 
It was unbearable , he would not think about it , he could not stand it … there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine , a dark hole where Sirius had been , where Sirius had vanished ; he did not want to have to be alone with that great , silent space , he could not stand it - 
Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn , stretching his arms as he surveyed Harry out of shrewd , narrow eyes . 
" And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning ? " said Phineas eventually " This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful Headmaster . 
Or has Dumbledore sent you here ? 
Harry could not speak . 
Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead , but Harry could not tell him . 
To say it aloud would be to make it final , absolute , irretrievable . 
Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob . 
" I hope this means , " said the corpulent , red - nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind the Headmaster's desk , " that Dumbledore will soon be back among us ? " 
Harry turned . 
The wizard was surveying him with great interest . 
Harry nodded . 
He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back , but it remained immovable . 
" Oh good , " said the wizard . 
He settled himself on the throne - like chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry 
" Dumbledore thinks very highly of you , as I am sure you know , " he said comfortably . 
" Oh yes . 
Harry could not stand this , he could not stand being himself any more … he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body , never wished so intensely that he could be somebody ; anybody , else … 
The empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame , making Harry leap away from the door , staring at the man spinning inside the grate . 
As Dumbledore's tall form unfolded itself from the fire , the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake , many of them giving cries of welcome . 
" Thank you , " said Dumbledore softly . 
He did not look at Harry at first , but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew , from an inside pocket of his robes , the tiny , ugly , featherless Fawkes , whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full - grown Fawkes usually stood . 
" Well , Harry , " said Dumbledore , finally turning away from the baby bird , " you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night's events . " 
Harry tried to say , " Good , " but no sound came out . 
It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused , and although Dumbledore was for once looking at him directly , and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory , Harry could not bear to meet his eyes . 
" Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up , " said Dumbledore . " Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St . Mungo's , but it seems she will make a full recovery . " 
Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet , which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler . 
He was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word 
" I know how you ' re feeling , Harry , " said Dumbledore very quietly . 
" You see , Dumbledore ? " said Phineas Nigellus slyly " Never try to understand the students . 
They would much rather be tragically misunderstood , wallow in self - pity , stew in their own - " 
" That's enough , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . 
Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window . 
He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance . 
Sirius had appeared there once , disguised as the shaggy black dog , so he could watch Harry play … he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been … Harry had never asked him … 
" There is no shame in what you are feeling , Harry , " said Dumbledore's voice . 
Harry felt the white - hot anger lick his insides , blazing in the terrible emptiness , filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words . 
" My greatest strength , is it ? " said Harry , his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium , no longer seeing it . 
" What don't I know ? " asked Dumbledore calmly . 
Harry turned around , shaking with rage . 
" I don't want to talk about how I feel , all right ? " 
This pain is part of being human " 
" THEN - I - DON ' T - WANT - TO - BE - HUMAN ! " Harry roared , and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindlelegged table beside him and flung it across the room ; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall . 
Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright , and the portrait of Armando Dippet said , " Really ! " 
" I ' VE HAD ENOUGH , I ' VE SEEN ENOUGH , I WANT OUT , I WANT IT TO END , I DON ' T CARE ANY MORE " 
He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that , too . 
It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions . 
" You do care , " said Dumbledore . 
" I - DON ' T ! " Harry screamed , so loudly that he felt his throat might tear , and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him , too ; shatter that calm old face , shake him , hurt him , make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself . 
" Oh , yes , you do , " said Dumbledore , still more calmly . 
" You have now lost your mother , your father , and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known . 
Of course you care . " 
But words were no longer enough , smashing things was no more help ; he wanted to run , he wanted to keep running and never look back , he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him , that hatefully calm old face . 
He turned on his heel and ran to the door , seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it . 
But the door would not open . 
Harry turned back to Dumbledore . 
" Let me out , " he said . 
He was shaking from head to foot . 
" No , " said Dumbledore , simply . 
For a few seconds they stared at each other . 
" Let me out , " Harry said again . 
" No , " Dumbledore repeated . 
" If you don't - if you keep me in here - if you don't let me " 
" I daresay I have too many . " 
He walked around his desk and sat down . 
behind it , watching Harry . 
" Not until I have had my say , " said Dumbledore . 
" Do you - do you think I want to - do you think I give a - I DON ' T CARE WHAT YOU ' VE GOT TO SAY ! " Harry roared . 
" I don't want to hear anything you ' ve got to say ! " 
" You will , " said Dumbledore steadily . 
" Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be . 
If you are to attack me , as I know you are close to doing , I would like to have thoroughly earned it . " 
" What are you talking - ? " 
Sirius was a brave , clever and energetic man , and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger . 
Nevertheless , you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight . 
If I had been open with you , Harry , as I should have been , you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries , and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight . 
And Sirius would not have had to come after you . 
That blame lies with me , and with me alone . " 
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it . 
" Please sit down , " said Dumbledore . 
It was not an order , it was a request . 
Harry hesitated , then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood , and took the seat facing Dumbledore's desk . 
" Am I to understand , " said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left , " that my great - greatgrandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead ? " 
" Yes , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . 
" I don't believe it , " said Phineas brusquely . 
Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place . 
" Harry , I owe you an explanation , " said Dumbledore . " An explanation of an old man's mistakes . 
For I see now that what I have done , and not done , with regard to you , bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age . 
But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young … and I seem to have forgotten , lately … " The sun was rising properly now ; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and bright . 
" I guessed , fifteen years ago , " said Dumbledore , " when I saw the scar on your forehead , what it might mean . 
I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort . " 
" You ' ve told me this before , Professor , " said Harry bluntly . 
He did not care about being rude . 
He did not care about anything very much any more . 
" Yes , " said Dumbledore apologetically . 
" Yes , but you see - it is necessary to start with your scar . 
For it became apparent , shortly after you rejoined the magical world , that I was correct , and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you , or else feeling powerful emotion . " 
" I know , " said Harry wearily . 
" And this ability of yours - to detect Voldemort's presence , even when he is disguised , and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused - has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers . " 
Harry did not bother to nod . 
He knew all of this already . 
Sure enough , there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence . 
I am speaking , of course , of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr . Weasley " 
" Yeah , Snape told me , " Harry muttered . 
" But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you ? 
Why I did not teach you Occlumency ? 
Why I had not so much as looked at you for months ? " 
Harry looked up . 
" Yeah , " Harry mumbled . 
" You see , " Dumbledore continued , " I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind , to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts , and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so . 
I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was - or had ever been - closer than that of headmaster and pupil , he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me . 
I feared the uses to which he would put you , the possibility that he might try and possess you . 
Harry , I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way . 
Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him , ready to strike , in those moments when he and Dumbledore had made eye - contact . 
He hoped , when he possessed you briefly a short while ago , that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him . 
So you see , I have been trying , in distancing myself from you , to protect you , Harry . 
He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago , but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius ; none of it mattered … 
" Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley's attack . 
In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort's assaults on your mind , I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape . " 
He paused . 
Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore's explanation ; he could hear the occasional rustle of robes , the slight clearing of a throat . 
Phineas Nigellus had still not returned … 
" Professor Snape discovered , " Dumbledore resumed , " that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months . 
Voldemort , of course , had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body ; and as he dwelled on the door , so did you , though you did not know what it meant . 
" And then you saw Rockwood , who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest , telling Voldemort what we had known all along - that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected . 
Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness : in this case , either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic , and risk revealing himself at last - or else you would have to take it for him . 
He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him : a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart . 
" I didn't practice , I didn't bother , I could ' ve stopped myself having those dreams , Hermione kept telling me to do it , if I had he'd never have been able to show me where to go , and - Sirius wouldn't - Sirius wouldn't " 
Something was erupting inside Harry's head : a need to justify himself , to explain - 
" I tried to check he'd really taken Sirius , I went to Umbridge's office , I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn't there , he said he'd gone ! " 
" Kreacher lied , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic . " 
" Oh yes . 
Kreacher , I am afraid , has been serving more than one master for months . " 
" How ? " said Harry blankly . 
" He hasn't been out of Grimmauld Place for years . " 
" Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas , " said Dumbledore , " when Sirius , apparently , shouted at him to ' get out ' . 
He took Sirius at his word , and interpreted this as an order to leave the house . 
He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left … Black's cousin Narcissa , sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy " 
" How do you know all this ? " 
Harry said . 
His heart was beating very fast . 
He felt sick . 
He remembered worrying about Kreacher's odd absence over Christmas , remembered him turning up again in the attic … 
" Kreacher told me last night , " said Dumbledore . " You see , when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning , he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries . 
I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge's office . 
Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place . 
" When , however , you did not return from your trip into the Forest with Dolores Umbridge , Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort's . 
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued , " Alastor Moody , Nymphadora Tonks , Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he made contact . 
All agreed to go to your aid at once . 
In the meantime he , Professor Snape , intended to search the Forest for you . 
" But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you . 
He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened . 
And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry , it was the elf who told me - laughing fit to burst - where Sirius had gone . " 
" He was laughing ? " said Harry in a hollow voice . 
" Oh , yes , " said Dumbledore . " You see , Kreacher was not able to betray us totally . 
He is not Secret Keeper for the Order , he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts , or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal . 
He was bound by the enchantments of his kind , which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master , Sirius . 
But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort , yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it . " 
" Like what ? " said Harry . 
" Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother . 
Voldemort knew already , of course , that Sirius was in the Order , and that you knew where he was - but Kreacher's information made him realize that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black . " 
Harry's lips were cold and numb . 
" So … when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night … " 
Then , if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not , Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not . 
Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday , and , at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire , Sirius was upstairs tending to him . " 
There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs ; his breathing was quick and shallow . 
" And Kreacher told you all this … and laughed ? " he croaked . 
" He did not wish to tell me , " said Dumbledore . " But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story , before I left for the Department of Mysteries . " 
" And , " whispered Harry , his hands curled in cold fists on his knees , " and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him " 
" She was quite right , Harry , " said Dumbledore . " I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect . 
I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us . 
I do not think Sinus took me very seriously , or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's " 
His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's . 
He was forced to do Sirius's bidding , because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved , but he felt no true loyalty to him . 
And whatever Kreacher's faults , it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier " 
" DON ' T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT ! " Harry yelled . 
He was on his feet again , furious , ready to fly at Dumbledore , who had plainly not understood Sirius at all , how brave he was , how much he had suffered … 
" What about Snape ? " 
Harry spat . 
" You ' re not talking about him , are you ? 
When I told him 
Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual – " 
" Harry , you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge , " said Dumbledore steadily , " but as I have explained , he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said . 
It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest . 
It was he , too , who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius's whereabouts . " 
Harry disregarded this ; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape , it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt , and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him . 
" Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - he made out Sirius was a coward " 
" Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him , " said Dumbledore . 
Harry snarled . 
" He threw me out of his office ! " 
" I am aware of it , " said Dumbledore heavily " I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself , though I was sure , at the time , that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence – " 
" Snape made it worse , my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him " Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on " - how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort , make it easier for him to get inside my – " 
" I trust Severus Snape , " said Dumbledore simply " But I forgot - another old man's mistake - that some wounds run too deep for the healing . 
I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father - I was wrong . " 
" But that's okay , is it ? " 
yelled Harry , ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls . 
" Sirius did not hate Kreacher , " said Dumbledore . " He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice . 
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike … the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie . 
We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long , and we are now reaping our reward . " 
" I did not say that , nor will you ever hear me say it , " Dumbledore replied quietly . 
" Sirius was not a cruel man , he was kind to house - elves in general . 
" Yeah , he did hate it ! " said Harry , his voice cracking , turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away . 
The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked , without realizing what he was doing , without seeing the office at all . 
" I was trying to keep Sirius alive , " said Dumbledore quietly 
" You did it to me all last summer " 
Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his longfingered hands . 
Harry watched him , but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion , or sadness , or whatever it was from Dumbledore , did not soften him . 
On the contrary , he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness . 
Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half - moon glasses . 
" It is time , " he said , " for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago , Harry . 
I am going to tell you everything . 
I ask only a little patience . 
You will have your chance to rage at me - to do whatever you like - when I have finished . 
I will not stop you . " 
Harry glared at him for a moment , then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited . 
Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window , then looked back at Harry and said , " Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts , Harry , safe and whole , as I had planned and intended . 
I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep . 
I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years . " 
He paused . 
Harry said nothing . 
" You might ask - and with good reason - why it had to be so . 
" My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive . 
Voldemort had been vanquished hours before , but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large , angry , desperate and violent . 
Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever ? 
I knew not whether it would be ten , twenty or fifty years before he returned , but I was sure he would do so , and I was sure , too , knowing him as I have done , that he would not rest until he killed you . 
I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power . 
And so I made my decision . 
You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows , which he despises , and which he has always , therefore , underestimated - to his cost . 
I am speaking , of course , of the fact that your mother died to save you . 
She gave you a lingering protection he never expected , a protection that flows in your veins to this day . 
I put my trust , therefore , in your mother's blood . 
I delivered you to her sister , her only remaining relative . " 
" She doesn't love me , " said Harry at once . 
" She may have taken you grudgingly , furiously , unwillingly , bitterly , yet still she took you , and in doing so , she sealed the charm I placed upon you . 
Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you . " 
" I still don't . " 
" While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells , there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort . 
He shed her blood , but it lives on in you and her sister . 
Her blood became your refuge . 
You need return there only once a year , but as long as you can still call it home , while you are there he cannot hurt you . 
Your aunt knows this . 
I explained what I had done in the letter I left , with you , on her doorstep . 
" Wait , " said Harry . 
" Wait a moment . " 
He sat up straighter in his chair , staring at Dumbledore . 
You told her to remember - it was your voice – " 
" I thought , " said Dumbledore , inclining his head slightly , " that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you . 
I suspected the Dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son . " 
" It did , " said Harry quietly . 
He wanted to chuck me out , but after the Howler came she - she said I had to stay " 
He stared at the floor for a moment , then said , " But what's this got to do with – " 
He could not say Sirius's name . 
" Five years ago , then , " continued Dumbledore , as though he had not paused in his story , " you arrived at Hogwarts , neither as happy nor as well - nourished as I would have liked , perhaps , yet alive and healthy . 
You were not a pampered little prince , but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances . 
" And then … well , you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do . 
You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner - much sooner - than I 
You survived again . 
You did more . 
You delayed his return to full power and strength . 
You fought a man's fight . 
I was … prouder of you than I can say . 
And yet , knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed , I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it . 
I alone could prevent this , so I alone must be strong . 
" I don't understand what you ' re saying , " said Harry . 
" Don't you remember asking me , as you lay in the hospital wing , why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby ? " 
Harry nodded . 
" Ought I to have told you then ? " 
Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing , but his heart was racing again . 
" You do not see the flaw in the plan yet ? 
Well , as you know , I decided not to answer you . 
Eleven , I told myself , was much too young to know . 
I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven . 
The knowledge would be too much at such a young age . 
" I should have recognized the danger signs then . 
I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew , one day , I must give a terrible answer . 
I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day … YOU were too young , much too young . 
" And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts . 
And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced : once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams . 
You did not ask me again , however , why Voldemort had left that mark on you . 
We discussed your scar , oh yes … we came very , very close to the subject . 
Why did I not tell you everything ? 
" Well , it seemed to me that twelve was , after all , hardly better than eleven to receive such information . 
I allowed you to leave my presence , bloodstained , exhausted but exhilarated , and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought , perhaps , to have told you then , it was swiftly silenced . 
You were still so young , you see , and I could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph … 
" Do you see , Harry ? 
Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now ? 
I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen , that I had told myself I could avoid , that I must avoid . " 
" I don't – " " I cared about you too much , " said Dumbledore simply . 
" I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth , more for your peace of mind than my plan , more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed . 
In other words , I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act . 
I defy anyone who has watched you as I have - and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined - not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered . 
What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future , if in the here and now you were alive , and well , and happy ? 
I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands . 
I watched from afar as you struggled to repel Dementors , as you found Sirius , learned what he was and rescued him . 
Was I to tell you then , at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry ? 
But now , at the age of thirteen , my excuses were running out . 
Young you might be , but you had proved you were exceptional . 
" But you came out of the maze last year , having watched Cedric Diggory die , having escaped death so narrowly yourself … and I did not tell you , though I knew , now Voldemort had returned , I must do it soon . 
And now , tonight , I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long , because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this . 
Harry waited , but Dumbledore did not speak . 
" I still don't understand . " 
" Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth . 
He knew the prophecy had been made , though he did not know its full contents . 
He set out to kill you when you were still a baby , believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy . 
He discovered , to his cost , that he was mistaken , when the curse intended to kill you backfired . 
And so , since his return to his body , and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year , he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety . 
This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return : the knowledge of how to destroy you . " 
The sun had risen fully now : Dumbledore's office was bathed in it . 
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque , the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops , and behind him , the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes . 
" The prophecy's smashed , " Harry said blankly . 
" I was pulling Neville up those benches in the - the room where the archway was , and I ripped his robes and it fell … " 
" The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of 
But the prophecy was made to somebody , and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly " 
" Who heard it ? " 
asked Harry , though he thought he knew the answer already 
" I did , " said Dumbledore . " On a cold , wet night sixteen years ago , in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head inn . 
I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher , though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all . 
I was disappointed . 
It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself . 
I told her , courteously I hope , that I did not think she would be suitable for the post . 
I turned to leave . " 
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch . 
He bent down , slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin , carved with runes around the edges , in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape . 
Dumbledore walked back to the desk , placed the Pensieve upon it , and raised his wand to his own temple . 
From it , he withdrew silvery , gossamer - fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin . 
He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment . 
A figure rose out of it , draped in shawls , her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses , and she revolved slowly ; her feet in the basin . 
But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke , it was not in her usual ethereal , mystic voice , but in the harsh , hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before : 
" The one with the power to vanquish the - Dark Lord approaches … born to those who have thrice defied him , born as the seventh month dies … and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal , but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not … and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives … the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies … " 
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished . 
Harry said very quietly , for Dumbledore , still staring at the Pensieve , seemed completely lost in thought . 
" It … did that mean … what did that mean ? " 
" It meant , " said Dumbledore , " that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July , nearly sixteen years ago . 
This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times . " 
Harry felt as though something was closing in on him . 
Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses . 
Sibyll's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys , both born at the end of July that year , both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix , both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times . 
One , of course , was you . 
The other was Neville Longbottom . " 
" But then … but then , why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville's ? " 
" The official record was re - labeled after Voldemort's attack on you as a child , " said Dumbledore . " It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring . " 
" I am afraid , " said Dumbledore slowly , looking as though every word cost him a great effort , " that there is no doubt that it is you . " 
" But you said - Neville was born at the end of July , too - and his mum and dad – " 
" You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy , the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort … Voldemort himself would mark him as his equal . 
And so he did , Harry . 
He chose you , not Neville . 
He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse . " 
" But he might have chosen wrong ! " said Harry . 
" He might have marked the wrong person ! " 
" He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him , " said Dumbledore . " And notice this , Harry : he chose , not the pureblood ( which , according to his creed , is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing ) but the half - blood , like himself . 
He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you , and in marking you with that scar , he did not kill you , as he intended , but gave you powers , and a future , which have fitted you to escape him not once , but four times so far - something that neither your parents , nor Neville's parents , ever achieved . " 
" Why did he do it , then ? " said Harry , who felt numb and cold . 
" Why did he try and kill me as a baby ? 
He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then – " 
" That might , indeed , have been the more practical course , " said Dumbledore , " except that Voldemort's information about the prophecy was incomplete . 
As you and your friends found out to your cost , and I to mine that night , it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard . 
Of course , I had not dreamed , when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney , that I would hear anything worth overhearing . 
My - our - one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building . " 
" So he only heard - ? " 
" He heard only the beginning , the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort . 
Consequently , he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you , and marking you as his equal . 
So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you , that it might be wise to wait , to learn more . 
He did not know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not – " 
" There is a room in the Department of Mysteries , " interrupted Dumbledore , " that is kept locked at all times . 
It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death , than human intelligence , than the forces of nature . 
It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all . 
That power took you to save Sirius tonight . 
That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort , because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests . 
In the end , it mattered not that you could not close your mind . 
Harry closed his eyes . 
If he had not gone to save Sirius , Sirius would not have died … More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again , Harry asked , without caring much about the answer , " The end of the prophecy ... it was something about neither ... can live ... " 
" … while the other survives , " said Dumbledore . 
" So , " said Harry , dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him , " so does that mean that … that one of us has got to kill the other one … in the end ? " " Yes , " said Dumbledore . 
Somewhere far beyond the office walls , Harry could hear the sound of voices , students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast , perhaps . 
It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food , who laughed , who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever . 
Sirius seemed a million miles away already ; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil , he would have found Sirius looking back at him , greeting him , perhaps , with his laugh like a bark … 
" I feel I owe you another explanation , Harry , " said Dumbledore hesitantly . 
I must confess … that I rather thought … you had enough responsibility to be going on with . " 
Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore's face into his long silver beard . 
" In a brief statement on Friday night , Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that HeWho - Must - Not - Be - Named has returned to this country and is active once more . 
" ' It is with great regret that I must confirm that t he wizard styling himself Lord - well , you know who I mean - is alive and among us again ,'said Fudge , looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters . 
' It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the Dementors of Azkaban , who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry's employ . 
The Minister's statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community , which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was ' no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You - Know - Who is operating amongst us once more ' . 
" Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy , though it is believed that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named and a select band of followers ( known as Death Eaters ) gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening . 
" Albus Dumbledore , newly reinstated Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot , has so far been unavailable for comment . 
He has insisted over the past year that You - Know - Who is not dead , as was widely hoped and believed , but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power . 
" There you are , Harry , I knew they'd drag you into it somehow , " said Hermione , looking over the top of the paper at him . 
Harry was sitting on the end of Ron's bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sun day Prophet . 
Ginny , whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey , was curled up at the foot of Hermione's bed ; Neville , whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape , was in a chair between the two beds ; and Luna , who had dropped in to visit , clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler , was reading the magazine upside - down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying . 
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet , threw a few to Harry , Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth . 
There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain's tentacles had wrapped around him . 
According to Madam Pomfrey , thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else , though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr . Ubbly's Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement . 
" Yes , they ' re very complimentary about you now , Harry , " said Hermione , scanning down the article . 
" ' A lone voice of truth … perceived as unbalanced , yet never wavered in his story … forced to bear ridicule and slander … ' Hmmm , " she said , frowning , " I notice they don't mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the Prophet … " 
She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs . 
The curse Dolohov had used on her , though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud , had nevertheless caused , in Madam Pomfrey's words , ' quite enough damage to be going on with ' . 
" You - Know - Who's Last Attempt to Take Over , pages two to four , What the Ministry Should Have Told Us , page five , Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore , pages six to eight , Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter , page nine … Well , " said Hermione , folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside , " it's certainly given them lots to write about . 
And that interview with Harry isn't exclusive , it's the one that was in The Quibbler months ago … " 
" He got a very good price for it , too , so we ' re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer to see if we can catch a Crumple - Horned Snorkack . " 
Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment , then said , " That sounds lovely " 
Ginny caught Harry's eye and looked away quickly , grinning . 
" So , anyway , " said Hermione , sitting up a little straighter and wincing again , " what's going on in school ? " 
" Well , Flitwick's got rid of Fred and George's swamp , " said Ginny , " he did it in about three seconds . 
But he left a tiny patch under the window and he's roped it off " 
" Why ? " said Hermione , looking startled . 
" Oh , he just says it was a really good bit of magic , " said Ginny , shrugging . 
" I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George , " said Ron , through a mouthful of chocolate . 
Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked , " So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore's back ? " 
" Yes , " said Neville , " everything's settled right back to normal . " 
" Not at all , " said Ginny " He's really , really miserable , actually … " She lowered her voice to a whisper . 
" He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts … " 
All six of them looked around . 
Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them , gazing up at the ceiling . 
Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs ; how he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him - nobody knew , and Umbridge was certainly not telling . 
Since she had returned to the castle she had not , as far as any of them knew , uttered a single word . 
Nobody really knew what was wrong with her , either . 
Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it , but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed . 
" Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock , " whispered Hermione . 
" Yeah , she shows signs of life if you do this , " said Ron , and with his tongue he made soft clipclopping noises . 
Umbridge sat bolt upright , looking around wildly . 
" No , I must have been dreaming … " 
Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes . 
" He's got to , " said Harry , " the other centaurs won't take him back , will they ? " 
" It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach , " said Ginny 
" Mind you , the whole subject's useless if you ask me , Firenze isn't a lot better … " 
" How can you say that ? " Hermione demanded . 
" After we ' ve just found out that there are real prophecies ? " 
Harry's heart began to race . 
He had not told Ron , Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained . 
Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression . 
He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim , there was no other way … 
" It is a pity it broke , " said Hermione quietly , shaking her head . 
" Yeah , it is , " said Ron . " Still , at least You - Know - Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going ? " he added , looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up . 
" You know , he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are . " 
" Oh , all right then , " said Ron grumpily , looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond . 
" Say hello to him for us ! " called Hermione , as Harry proceeded down the ward . 
Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory . 
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday . 
Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds , enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework . 
Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor , peering out of windows as he went ; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake , accompanied by the giant squid . 
He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not ; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company . 
He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid , though , as he had not talked to him properly since he'd returned … 
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room . 
Harry stopped dead ; so did Malfoy and the others . 
The only sounds were the shouts , laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors . 
Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers - then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice , " You ' re dead , Potter . " 
Harry raised his eyebrows . 
" Funny " he said , " you'd think I'd have stopped walking around … " 
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him ; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale , pointed face contorted with rage . 
" You ' re going to pay , " said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper . 
" I'm going to make you pay for what you ' ve done to my father … " 
" Well , I'm terrified now , " said Harry sarcastically . 
" I s ' pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm - up act compared to you three - what's the matter ? " he added , for Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name . 
Not scared of him , are you ? " 
" You think you ' re such a big man , Potter , " said Malfoy , advancing now , Crabbe and Goyle flanking him . 
I ' ll have you . 
You can't land my father in prison " 
" I thought I just had , " said Harry . 
" The Dementors have left Azkaban , " said Malfoy quietly . 
" Yeah , I expect they will , " said Harry " Still , at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now " 
Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand , but Harry was too quick for him ; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes . 
" Potter ! " 
The voice rang across the Entrance Hall . 
Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy … whatever Dumbledore said , he would never forgive Snape … never … 
" What are you doing , Potter ? " said Snape , as coldly as ever , as he strode over to the four of them . 
" I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy , sir , " said Harry fiercely . 
Snape stared at him . 
Snape looked towards the giant hour - glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile . 
In that case , Potter , we will simply have to - " 
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle ; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other , but otherwise looked quite well . 
" Professor McGonagall ! " said Snape , striding forwards . 
" Yes , Professor Snape , " said Professor McGonagall , shrugging off her traveling cloak , " I'm quite as good as new . 
She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came , shuffling their large feet and looking awkward . 
" Here , " said Professor McGonagall , thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe's chest and her cloak into Goyle's ; " take these up to my office for me . " 
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase . 
" Right then , " said Professor McGonagall , looking up at the hourglasses on the wall . 
" Well , I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You - Know - Who ! 
What say you , Professor Snape ? " 
" What ? " snapped Snape , though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well . 
" So that's fifty each for Potter , the two Weasleys , Longbottom and Miss Granger , " said Professor McGonagall , and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor's hour - glass as she spoke . 
" Oh - and fifty for Miss Lovegood , I suppose , " she added , and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw's glass . 
" Well , Potter , Malfoy I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this , " Professor McGonagall continued briskly . 
Harry did not need telling twice - he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy . 
Students lying around on the grass sunbathing , talking , reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets , looked up at him as he passed ; some called out to him , or else waved , clearly eager to show that they , like the Prophet , had decided he was something of a hero . 
He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago , but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way . 
He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid's cabin door that he was out , but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome . 
" All righ ' , Harry ! " he said , beaming , when Harry approached the fence . 
Hagrid asked him , as they settled d own at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice . 
Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid's face that he was not referring to Harry's physical well - being . 
" I'm fine , " Harry said quickly , because he could no t bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid's mind . 
" Up in a cave , like Sirius did when he – " 
Hagrid broke off , cleared his throat gruffly , looked at Harry , and took a long draught of juice . 
" Anyway , back now , " he said feebly . 
" You - you look better , " said Harry , who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius . 
Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back , ter tell yeh the truth . 
He's a good lad , really … I ' ve bin thinkin ' abou ' tryin'ter find him a lady friend , actually … " 
Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once ; the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the Forest , possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp , was positively alarming , but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point . 
He was starting to wish he was alone again , and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice , half - emptying his glass . 
" Ev ' ryone knows yeh ' ve bin tellin'the truth now , Harry , " said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly . 
Harry shrugged . 
" Look … " Hagrid leaned towards him across the table , " I knew Sirius longer ' n yeh did … he died in battle , an'tha's the way he'd ' ve wanted ter go – " 
" He didn't want to go at all ! " said Harry angrily . 
Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head … 
" Nah , I don ' reckon he did , " he said quietly . 
" But s till , Harry … he was never one ter sit aroun ' at home an ' let other people do the fightin ' . 
Harry leapt up . 
" I ' ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing , " he said mechanically . 
Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open ; he was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye , and walking away across the lawn . 
He closed his eyes for a few moments , wishing they would all vanish , that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds … 
A few days ago , before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind , he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth , for them to believe that Voldemort was back , and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad . 
He walked a short way around the lake , sat down on its bank , sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs , and stared out over the gleaming water , thinking … 
An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world . 
It was just that he had never really understood what that meant … 
And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake , with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him , with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside , he could not muster any great sense of fear . 
It was sunny , and the grounds around him were full of laughing people , and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race , it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include , or end in , murder … 
He sat there for a long time , gazing out at the water , trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here , on the opposite bank , that Sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred Dementors … 
He got up and returned to the castle , wiping his face on his sleeve as he went . 
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term . 
Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius , but Ron tended to make ` hushing noises every time she mentioned his name . 
Harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet ; his wishes varied with his mood . 
He knew one thing , though : unhappy as he felt at the moment , he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days ' time when he was back at number four , Privet Drive . 
Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer , he did not feel any better about it . 
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term . 
It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime , evidently hoping to depart undetected , but unfortunately for her , she met Peeves on the way , who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed , and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk . 
Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half - heartedly to restrain them . 
Indeed , Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself , because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick . 
Their last evening at school arrived ; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end - of - term feast , but Harry had not even started . 
" Come on , I'm starving . " 
But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron , Harry made no effort to speed up his packing . 
The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast . 
He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech . 
Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and , as he did so , noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it . 
He bent down , pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it . 
He realized what it was within seconds . 
Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place . 
Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package . 
Out fell a small , square mirror . 
It looked old ; it was certainly dirty . 
Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him . 
He turned the mirror over . 
This is a two - way mirror , I ' ve got the other . 
If you need to speak to me , just say my name into it ; you ' ll appear in my mirror and I ' ll be able to talk in yours . 
James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions . 
Harry's heart began to race . 
He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago . 
He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again , right now , he knew it - 
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there ; the dormitory was quite empty . 
He looked back at the mirror , raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said , loudly and clearly , " Sirius . " 
His breath misted the surface of the glass . 
He held the mirror even closer , excitement flooding through him , but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own . 
He wiped the mirror clear again and said , so that every syllable rang clearly through the room : 
" Sirius Black ! " 
Nothing happened . 
Sirius didn't have his mirror on him when he went through the archway , said a small voice in Harry's head . 
Harry remained quite still for a moment , then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered . 
He had been convinced , for a whole , shining minute , that he was going to see Sirius , talk to him again … 
Disappointment was burning in his throat ; he got up and began throwing his things pell - mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror - 
But then an idea struck him … a better idea than a mirror … a much bigger , more important idea … how had he never thought of it before - why had he never asked ? 
He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing ; he hurtled across the empty common room , through the portrait hole and off along the corridor , ignoring the Fat Lady , who called after him : " The feast is about to start , you know , you ' re cutting it very fine ! " 
He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead . 
Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt , panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later , until after the end of the feast … 
But just as he had given up hope , he saw it - a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor . 
" Hey - hey Nick ! NICK ! " 
The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall , revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington . 
" Good evening , " he said , withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry " I am not the only one who is late , then ? 
Though , " he sighed , " in a rather different sense , of course … " 
" Nick , can I ask you something ? " 
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter , apparently to give himself thinking time . 
He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely . 
" Can't it wait until after the feast ? " 
" No - Nick - please , " said Harry , " I really need to talk to you . 
Can we go in here ? " 
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed . 
Harry was holding the door open for him , but he drifted through the wall instead . 
Harry asked , as he closed the door . 
" You to come and find me , " said Nick , now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds . 
Nick said nothing . 
But you ' re still here , aren't you ? " 
Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds . 
" You died , but I'm talking to you … you can walk around Hogwarts and everything , can't you ? " 
" Yes , " said Nearly Headless Nick quietly , " I walk and talk , yes . " 
" So , you came back , didn't you ? " said Harry urgently . 
As ghosts . 
They don't have to disappear completely . 
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated , then said , " Not everyone can come back as a ghost . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " said Harry quickly 
So he can come back , right ? " 
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry . 
" He won't come back . " 
" Sirius Black , " said Nick . 
" But you did ! " said Harry angrily . 
" You came back - you ' re dead and you didn't disappear - " 
" Why not ? " said Harry . 
" Anyway - it doesn't matter - Sirius won't care if it's unusual , he ' ll come back , I know he will ! " 
And so strong was his belief , Harry actually turned his head to check the door , sure , for a split second , that he was going to see Sirius , pearly - white and transparent but beaming , walking through it towards him . 
" He will not come back , " repeated Nick . 
" He will have … gone on . " 
" What d ' you mean , ' gone on ' ? " said Harry quickly " Gone on where ? 
Listen - what happens when you die , anyway ? 
Where do you go ? 
Why - ? " 
" I cannot answer , " said Nick . 
" Who can answer better than you ? " 
" I was afraid of death , " said Nick softly . 
I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have … well , that is neither here nor there … in fact , I am neither here nor there … " 
He gave a small sad chuckle . 
" I know nothing of the secrets of death , Harry , for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead . 
I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries - " 
" Don't talk to me about that place ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" I am sorry not to have been more help , " said Nick gently " Well … well , do excuse me … the feast , you know … " 
And he left the room , leaving Harry there alone , gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared . 
Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more . 
He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle , wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again . 
He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady's corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall . 
A second glance showed him it was Luna . 
There were no good hiding places nearby , she was bound to have heard his footsteps , and in any case , Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment . 
" Hello , " said Luna vaguely , glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice . 
" How come you ' re not at the feast ? " 
Harry asked . 
" People take them and hide them , you know . 
But as it's the last night , I really do need them back , so I ' ve been putting up signs . " 
She gestured towards the noticeboard , upon which , sure enough , she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes , with a plea for their return . 
An odd feeling rose in Harry ; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius's death . 
" I think they think I'm a bit odd , you know . 
Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully . 
" That's no reason for them to take your things , " he said flatly . 
" Oh , no , " she said , smiling at him . 
It was just that I wanted to pack tonight . 
Anyway … why aren't you at the feast ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
" Just didn't feel like it . " 
Harry nodded curtly , but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius . 
He had just remembered that she , too , could see Thestrals . 
" I mean , who … has anyone you known ever died ? " 
" Yes , " said Luna simply , " my mother . 
She was a quite extraordinary witch , you know , but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day . 
I was nine . " 
" I still feel very sad about it sometimes . 
But I ' ve still got Dad . 
And anyway , it's not as though I ' ll never see Mum again , is it ? " 
" Er - isn't it ? " said Harry uncertainly . 
She shook her head in disbelief . 
You heard them , just behind the veil , didn't you ? " 
" You mean … " 
" In that room with the archway . 
They were just lurking out of sight , that's all . 
You heard them . " 
They looked at each other . 
Harry did not know what to say , or to think ; Luna believed so many extraordinary things … yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil , too . 
" Are you sure you don't want me to help you look for your stuff ? " he said . 
" Oh , no , " said Luna . " No , I think I ' ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up … it always does in the end … well , have a nice holiday Harry " 
" Yeah … yeah , you too . " 
She walked away from him and , as he watched her go , he found that the terrible weight in his stomach - seemed to have lessened slightly . 
Firstly Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle , who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses , attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet . 
The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D . A . members , who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry's aid . 
By the time Ernie Macmillan , Hannah Abbott , Susan Bones , Justin Finch - Fletchley , Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them , Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry , Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze . 
" I must say , I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mother's face when he gets off the train , " said Ernie , with some satisfaction , as he watched Malfoy squirm above him . 
Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment , where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties . 
Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again , Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia , which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched . 
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet . 
It was now full of articles about how to repel Dementors , attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning … 
" Hey , Harry " said Ron softly , nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor . 
Harry looked around . 
Cho was passing , accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe , who was wearing a balaclava . 
His and Cho's eyes met for a moment . 
Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight . 
" Nothing , " said Harry truthfully . 
" I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now , " said Hermione tentatively . 
Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him ; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius ' , death felt that way these days … the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much , much longer ; it stretched across two universes , the one with Sirius in it , and the one without . 
Ron asked Hermione , but it was Ginny who answered . 
" Michael Corner , " she said . 
" Michael - but – " said Ron , craning around in hiss eat to stare at her . " But you were going out with him ! " 
" He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch , and got really sulky , so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead . " 
She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill , turned The Quibbler upside - down and began marking her answers . 
Ron looked highly delighted . 
" Well , I always thought he was a bit of an idiot , " he said , prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle . 
Just choose someone - better - next time . " 
" Well , I ' ve chosen Dean Thomas , would you say he's better ? " asked Ginny vaguely . 
" WHAT ? " shouted Ron , upending the chessboard : Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead . 
As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross , Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less . 
He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off , but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September , when it would take him back to Hogwarts . 
When the ticket inspector signaled to Harry , Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten , however , he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side : a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all . 
There was Mad - Eye Moody , looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it , his gnarled hands clutching a long staff , his body wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak . 
Tonks stood just behind him , her bright bubblegumpink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling , wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T - shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters . 
At the front of the group stood Mr . and Mrs . Weasley , dressed in their Muggle best , and Fred and George , who were both wearing brand - new jackets in some lurid green , scaly material . 
" Ron , Ginny ! " called Mrs . Weasley , hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly " Oh , and Harry dear - how are you ? " 
" Fine , " lied Harry , as she pulled him into a tight embrace . 
Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins ' new clothes . 
" What are they supposed to be ? " he asked , pointing at the jackets . 
" Hello , Harry " said Lupin , as Mrs . Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione . 
" Well , " said Lupin with a slight smile , " we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home . " 
" I dunno if that's a good idea , " said Harry at once . 
" Oh , I think it is , " growled Moody , who had limped a little closer . 
He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder ; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat . 
Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad - Eye was pointing and there , sure enough , were the three Dursleys , who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee . 
" Ah , Harry " said Mr . Weasley , turning from Hermione's parents , who he had just greeted enthusiastically , and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione . 
" Yeah , I reckon so , Arthur , " said Moody . 
He and Mr . Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys , who were apparently rooted to the floor . 
" Good afternoon , " said Mr . Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him . 
" You might remember me , my name's Arthur Weasley " 
As Mr . Weasley had single - handedly demolished most o f the Dursleys ' living room two years previously , Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him . 
Sure enough , Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr . Weasley , but chose not to say anything , partly , perhaps , because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one . 
Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed ; she kept glancing around , as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company . 
Dudley , meanwhile , seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant , a feat at which he was failing extravagantly . 
" We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry , " said Mr . Weasley , still smiling . 
" About how he's treated when he's at your place . " 
Uncle Vernon's moustache seemed to bristle with indignation . 
" I expect what you ' re not aware of would fill several books , Dursley , " growled Moody . 
" Anyway , that's not the point , " interjected Tonks , whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together , for she closed her eyes rather than look at her . " The point is , if we find out you ' ve been horrible to Harry – " 
" Yes , " said Mr . Weasley , " even if you won't let Harry use the fellytone – " 
" - Yeah , if we get any hint that Potter's been mistreated in any way , you ' ll have us to answer to , " said Moody . 
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously . 
His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs . 
" Are you threatening me , sir ? " he said , so loudly t hat passers - by actually turned to stare . 
" Yes , I am , " said Mad - Eye , who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly . 
" And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated ? " 
barked Uncle Vernon . 
" Well … " said Moody , pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye . 
He turned away from Uncle Vernon to survey Harry . 
If we don't hear from you for three days in a row , we ' ll send someone along … " 
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously . 
It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path . 
" Bye , then , Potter , " said Moody , grasping Harry's shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand . 
" Harry , we ' ll have you away from there as soon as we can , " Mrs . Weasley whispered , hugging him again . 
" We ' ll see you soon , mate , " said Ron anxiously , shaking Harry's hand . 
" Really soon , Harry " said Hermione earnestly . 
Harry nodded . 
He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him , to see them all ranged there , on his side .
