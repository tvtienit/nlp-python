Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets 
Chapter 1 
This is not the first argument that broke out in breakfast at Privet Drive 4 . 
Early in the morning , Mr. Vernon Dursley was awakened by a loud noise from his Harry's room . 
He roared from the dining table : 
- This is the third time this week ! 
You can not hold that owl , you have to throw it away for me ! 
Again , Harry must try to explain : 
- It's so boring , Uncle . 
She used to fly outside . 
If you let her release it tonight 
Uncle Vernon bundled an egg , scrambled eggs sticking out into the bushy mustache of the uncle : 
- Are you stupid ? 
I know what happens if I drop the owl 
He threw his wife , Aunt Petunia , a look of darkness . 
Harry frowned , but his voice was engulfed by Dudley's long , bulging buzzwords : 
- I want to eat more fried meats . 
Aunt Petunia turned her eyes toward the bulky boy : 
- There's a lot in that pan ! 
Whenever I have the opportunity to mothers have to nourish the children do not like the food in school 
- Blubber , he was never hungry when he attended Smeltings . 
Uncle Vernon eagerly interrupted his wife , then turned to his son : 
- Is it enough for your child to eat , is not it my son ? 
Dudley was so big that his ass was on both sides of the kitchen chair . 
He grinned at her and turned to Harry . 
- put the pan ! 
Harry annoyed : 
- You forgot to say the two colored words ! 
The effect of this simple sentence on all the rest of the family was unbelievable : Dudley gasped and fell from the chair and knocked on a chair that shook the kitchen ; Mrs. Dursley gave a small chuckle and held her hands together ; and Dursley stood up , his blood vessels rising from his temples . 
Harry explained hastily : 
- I mean , two hours , I do not mean 
But her stepfad raged , roared , saliva sprayed throughout the table : 
- WHAT IS TAO WHAT's WRONG ABOUT THE SAY SAYING IN THE TEA HOUSE ? 
- But you 
Uncle punched down the table one , roared : 
- WHAT DO YOU DO FOR DUDLEY ? 
- You just 
- TOO REFUGE ! I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING OF ANYTHING IN THIS HOUSE . 
Harry glanced at Vernon's unruly face to the aunt's pouting face . 
I'm trying to help Dudley stand up . 
- Yes . Said Harry , " OK 
Uncle Vernon sat down , panting like a rhinoceros , and looked at Harry through the small corner of his eye . 
Ever since Harry's vacation home , Uncle Vernon treated it like a bomb that could explode at any moment , because Harry was not a normal kid . 
Well , Harry can not be as normal as he wants to be . 
Uncle Vernon is big and no neck , only a great mustache . 
Harry Potter is a witch - a new witch has completed his first year at Hogwarts , magic academy and magic . 
And if the Dursleys were not happy to be home for the summer , that would not be so much of a distraught grin on Harry . 
He remembers Hogwarts as earnest as having a chronic stomach ache . 
He remembers the castle with its secret corridors and ghosts , remembers classes ( though perhaps not remembering the master of Snape's poison ) . 
He remembered the delivery in the morning , remembering the long table in the Great Hall , the bed between the four posters in the dormitory tower . 
Remember the visits to Dr . Hagrid - the keeper of the lock - in the cabin next door 
Forbidden Forest . 
And it's especially remembered Quidditch , the most popular sport in the wizarding world ( with six high pitches , four balls , and fourteen players ) . 
Aunt Petunia's face was as long as a horse , bony . 
All of Harry's mantra books , witches , witch robes , cauldrons , and brooms of the top of the Nimbus 2000 were unmasked by Uncle Vernon in his jutting under the stairs at the time Harry had set foot . return . 
The Dursleys are concerned that Harry could lose his place in the Gryffindor Quidditch team because he did not practice at all during the summer . 
And if Harry returned to Hogwarts School without completing any work , what would he eat for the Dursleys ? 
The Dursleys were the ones the wizards called Muggles ( who did not have a drop of blood in their veins ) , and in the Dursleys view , having a witch in the house was a profound scandal . the best . 
Uncle Vernon locked Harry's owl , Hedwig , in his cage and locked it , not giving it to anyone in the wizarding world . 
Harry is not like anyone in this family . 
Uncle Vernon was big and had no neck , only a great black mustache ; Aunt Petunia's face was as long as a horse , bony ; Dudley was blond , rosy , and rebellious . 
While Harry was small and skinny , his green eyes were bright and his dark hair was always messy . 
He wears round glasses , and on his forehead there is a thin lightning scar . 
It was this scars that made Harry special , even for a witch , it was a very special thing : the scar was the only sign of Harry's mysterious past , the reason Harry was removed on the threshold of the Dursleys more than eleven years ago . 
In just one year , somehow , Harry survived under the spell of the greatest black sorceress of all time - Sir Voldemort - a name that most witches are still afraid of when mentioned . 
Harry's parents were killed by Voldemort , but Harry survived the lightning scar , and - no one understood why - Voldemort's power was dissipated the moment he did not kill Harry . 
Harry was raised by his aunt . 
He had lived with the Dursleys for ten years , not knowing why it would cause so many strange things , though it was not intentional ; And it also believed in the story that the Dursleys had told me , that the scar he had was in a car accident that left his parents dead . 
Then , a year ago , Hogwarts sent a letter to Harry , causing the entire story to be exposed . 
Harry and his scars became famous . But now the school year has passed , it must return to the Dursleys for summer vacation , being treated like a dog . Scabies . 
The Dursleys did not even remember today as Harry's twelfth birthday . 
Of course , Harry did not expect much ; They have never given it a real gift , let alone a birthday cake . 
But absolutely nothing at all smooth 
At this point , Uncle Vernon cleared his throat solemnly and said , 
- Listen , as everyone knows , today was a very important day . 
Harry raised his head , not daring to believe it . 
Uncle Vernon said : 
- this is probably the day when we have achieved great advancement in our profession to date . 
Harry looked back down at his toast . 
So , he thought bitterly , Uncle Vernon was talking about that absurd dinner . 
For two weeks now he has not talked about anything else . 
A wealthy builder and his wife will come to dinner , and Uncle Vernon , the maker of drilling machines , hopes to earn his big order . 
Uncle Vernon said : 
- I think we should watch the show again . At eight o ' clock we should all be in the right place . 
Petunia , I will stand 
- in the living room , waiting for the guests to come to our house . 
" Aunt Petunia answered immediately . 
Uncle Vernon satisfied : 
- Good , good , Dudley ? 
- I will wait to open the door . 
Dudley replied and made a fake smile : 
- Mr. Mason , allow me to take his grandparent's jacket . 
Aunt Petunia exclaimed happily . 
- They will love him baby ! 
- Excellent , Dudley ! 
Uncle Vernon finished his son turned to Harry : 
- And you ? 
Harry said in a pensive voice : 
- You will be in the bedroom , do not make noise and pretend like not present . 
- right ! - Vernon's voice is evil . 
- He will lead them into the living room , introduce to you , Petunia , and I will pour wine to invite them . 
At eight o ' clock 
Aunt Petunia said to her husband : 
- I will invite guests to dinner . 
- And Dudley , I will say 
- Mrs. Mason , allow me to take her to the dining room ? 
Dudley said , putting his arm around the invisible woman . 
Aunt Petunia inhaled : 
- Oh my perfect little brother ! 
- And you ? 
Uncle Harry Vernon . 
It chewed dull : 
- You will be in the bedroom , do not make noise and pretend like not present . 
- it's correct . 
Now let's pretend some praise in the party . 
Petunia , what is your opinion ? 
" Mr. Mason , Mr. Vernon told me he was a great golfer , Mrs. Mason , please point me to where you bought this dress . 
- Great . 
And Dudley ? 
" At school we have to write a thesis about our hero , and Mr. Mason , I write about you . 
This is too much for Aunt Petunia and Harry . 
Aunt Petunia cried out and hugged her great son , and Harry staggered down to the table not to be seen laughing . 
- And you , that guy ? 
Harry emerged , keeping his serious expression : 
- You will be in the bedroom , do not make noise and pretend like not present . 
- yes , do it for me . 
Vernon's voice was threatening . 
- Mr. and Mrs. Mason do not know anything about you and will never know you . 
When the party ends , he will take Mrs. Mason back to the living room to drink coffee , Petunia , and he will lead the story to the drilling machines . 
If you are lucky , you will sign the stamp of this business before ten pm . 
And tomorrow at this time , we will go shopping for our holiday home in Majorca . 
Harry did not feel excited about this , because in Majorca the Dursleys did not like it much more than they were at 4 Privet Drive . 
- Then let him down the street to get his party jacket and Dudley . 
Turning to Harry , Uncle Vernon said , 
- As for you , whether the soul that avoids the aunt you sweep up ! 
Harry snapped out by the back door . 
It was a sunny day . 
He crossed the lawn , plopped down on the bench in the garden , and sang to me quietly : 
- Wish me a happy birthday ! 
A happy birthday to me ! 
There is no card , no presents , and tonight it will be as if it were not present in the world . 
He looked sadly at the hedge . 
He never felt so lonely . He missed her , remembering anything else in Hogwarts , more than Quidditch matches . 
He remembers his best friends , Hermione and Ron . 
But maybe they do not remember it at all . 
During the summer , neither of them wrote to Harry . 
Even Ron , who had promised to invite Harry to his house , was also incredulous . 
How many times , Harry used the magic to remove cage cage for Hedwig to bring it to Hermione and Ron . 
But it's understandable not to risk just one thing . 
Juvenile offenders are not allowed to use magic outside the school . 
Harry has not told the Dudley family yet ; He knew it , because they feared it would turn them into beetles they would not dare to confine to the room under the stairs with their wands and broomsticks . 
Two large green eyes appeared among the trees . 
For the first few weeks when Harry had just returned home , he enjoyed pretending to mumble the insignificant nonsense to see Dudley , with his fertile body , coming out of the room at full speed . 
But the long silence of Ron and Hermione made Harry feel so isolated from the wizarding world that he was always teasing Dudley . 
And to this day , both Ron and Hermione have forgotten their birthday . 
Now what will it exchange for a letter from Hogwarts ? 
From any witch ? 
Even now seeing the image of the enemy is not common ground , 
Draco Malfoy , he is also happy , as long as he can be confident that everything that belongs to Hogwarts is not just a dream . 
Her school year at Hogwarts was not all fun . 
In the last days of the school year , Harry had to face Voldemort himself , no one else . 
Although Voldemort was only a remnant of his former self , he was still scary , still cunning , determined to regain power . 
Harry had escaped Voldemort's second - handed vengeance , but escaped death in the interstitial ; Even now , he still woke up in the middle of the night , sweating cold , wondering where Voldemort was now . 
He still remembers his glittering face and his massive , crazy eyes 
Suddenly Harry sat up on the bench . 
He glared absent - mindedly at the hedge in front of him - and realized that the hedge was still there . 
Two big green eyes appeared among the leaves . 
Harry jumped up and a mocking voice came from the other side of the lawn : 
" I know what day it is ! 
Dudley squealed and turned to Harry . 
Two big eyes flashed and disappeared . 
Harry did not finish his eyes from the place where the eyes of the mulch were : 
- What you say ? 
Dudley approached Harry , repeating : 
" I know what day it is ! 
- Good . So you finally know the days of the week ? 
Laughed Dudley : 
- Today is your birthday . 
Why do not you receive a greeting card ? Do not you have any friends in that demonic school ? 
Harry said casually : 
- Better not let your mothers hear you talk about my school . 
Dudley pulled up his pants , his pants slipping under his ass . 
He asked suspiciously : 
- Why are you staring at the hedge ? 
Harry said : 
- I was thinking what kind of spell to use to burn this hedge is the best . 
Dudley immediately jumped out , his panic on his face . 
- You do not say you can not do the magic Three said he would throw you out of the house That you have no other place to go to where no friends come home 
Harry read angrily : 
- There are three big three ! 
Talk nonsense ! 
Loose ! 
Get rid of it ! 
Dudley howled : 
- MAAAAAAÁÁÁ ! 
It has four legs running in the creek . 
- MAAA ! 
What does it do ? 
Harry paid dearly for a little fun of it . 
Because both Dudley and the hedge were not hurt , Aunt Petunia knew that Harry was not actually doing magic . 
But Harry also had to claw his head out of the soap - scented pan that she had in his head . 
Then she punished him , and he made him work , and threatened that if he did not work , he would not eat . 
While Dudley hovered over to eat ice cream while looking around , Harry wiped the window , washed the car , cut the grass , trimmed the flowers , watered the pink dust , and painted the bench in the garden . 
The sun shines on its head , burning its neck . 
Harry knew it should not have taken Dudley's bait , but Dudley had hit his heart , telling him that it was not his real friend at Hogwarts . 
Wishing they could see the famous Harry Potter at this time . 
Harry bitterly thought , as he spread his stools over the flowerpot , his back aching and sweat running down his face . 
Finally , at seven o ' clock , when she was exhausted , she heard Aunt Petunia cry out : 
- Come in ! 
Step on the floor paper hear not ! 
Harry went under the shade of the bright kitchen . 
On the top of the refrigerator is the cake for tonight : buttered butter and a purple flower made of sugar . a large pork rolled in the oven . 
Aunt Petunia had only two slices of bread and a pinch of cheese on the kitchen table , Harry : 
- Hurry up ! 
Mr. and Mrs. Mason are coming . 
Aunt Petunia had already put on a pink dress . 
Unfortunately , there was someone in the bed already . 
Harry washed his hands and devastated his pathetic meal . 
As soon as Harry finished eating , Aunt Petunia moved her fork right away . 
- Upstairs ! 
Hurry up ! 
As he crossed the living room , Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in his wedding gown and bow tie . 
It just barely climbed up the stairs , the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon's angry face appeared at the foot of the stairs . 
- Remember not to ejaculate - only a sound is 
Harry tiptoes to the bedroom , opens the door , closes the door and throws himself on his bed . 
Unfortunately , there was someone in the bed already . 
Chapter 2 : DOBBY's WARNING 
Harry was grateful , he screamed loudly . 
The tiny creature on the bed has big ears like a bat's wings and its eyes are blue as a tennis ball . 
Harry knew immediately that these were the two eyes that had observed him at the brink of this morning . 
As the two glared at each other , Harry heard Dudley's voice in the hallway : 
- Mrs. Mason , allow me to take your grandparent's coat . 
The creature slipped down the bed and bowed so low that the tip of her thin and long nose touched the carpet . 
Harry noticed that it was like a worn old pillowcase to protrude into his arms and legs . 
It is worn like an old pillowcase that has excess grooves to protrude into the arms and legs . 
Harry said impatiently : 
- Hello ! 
- Harry Potter ! 
The creature spoke in such a high pitch that Harry was expecting it down the stairs . 
- Dobby was so eager to see him , it was an honor 
- Thank you . 
Harry said and yanked from the wall to sit down at the desk at the study table , next to Hedwig drunk in his big cage . 
Harry would like to ask What kind of a friend are you ? But it sounded a bit rude , so it changed , asking : 
- Who are you ? 
The creature replied : 
- Sir , I'm Dobby . 
Only Dobby . 
Dobby elves . 
- Hey , really ? 
I do not mean insolent or anything , but this is not the best time to have an elf on my bed . 
From beneath the guest room laughed at the pseudonym of aunt Petunia . 
The elf collapses . 
Harry hurriedly said : 
- It does not mean I'm not happy to meet you , but oh , you must come here for a special reason ? 
Dobby said earnestly : 
Yes , sir . 
Dobby came to tell you , sir it was hard Dobby did not know where to start 
Harry pointed to the bed : 
- Please sit . 
The elf burst into tears , sobbing , causing Harry to marvel . 
The elf sobbing : 
- M please sit ! 
Never before . 
Harry thought as if hesitating under the stairs . 
He whispered : 
- Sorry , I do not mean to offend you or anything 
The elves hiccup : 
- offend Dobby ! 
Dobby had never been invited by a sorceress as an equal 
Harry struggled , slurring , leading Dobby back to bed , letting him sit there sobbing like a huge , ugly doll . 
Eventually the elf restrained himself , and he sat there with his huge eyes staring at Harry with the expression of tears . 
Said Harry , trying to make the elf happier : 
- There are not many witches too polite ! 
Dobby shook his head . 
Suddenly , without warning , he jumped , angered his head in the window , shouting : 
- Dobby bad ! 
Bad dobby 
- what do you do ? 
Harry squatted up , pulling him up against the bed . 
Hedwig was awakened , giving a loud , loud crash and furiously knocking on the bars of the cage . 
The elf , slightly cross - eyed , said : 
" Sir , Dobby must punish himself . 
Dobby nearly defamed his family , sir 
- Your family ? 
- That is the family of wizards that Dobby served , Mr. Dobby is a servant spinner in a witch forced to serve in a house and a professor forever 
Harry asked curiously : 
- Do they know you are here ? 
Dobby shuddered : 
- Oh , no , sir , Dobby will be punished severely for coming to see him . 
Dobby would have to shut his ears in the oven door for this . 
If they knew , sir 
- But do they even care about your ears or ears in the oven door ? 
- Sir , Dobby is not sure . 
Dobby always had to punish himself for something , sir . 
They let Dobby do it . Sometimes they even remind Dobby of self punishment , too 
- Why do not you leave ? 
Escape for example ? 
" Sir , an elf only goes when he is liberated by the master . " 
And that family will not be free . Dobby Dobby will have to serve the family to death , sir 
Harry's eyes widened . 
It says : 
" But I thought I had to stay here for another four weeks , it was so miserable . 
So compared to your story , the Dursley family is still humanitarian ? 
Can someone help you ? 
May I help you ? 
Almost immediately after , Harry wished not to say that . 
Because Dobby bluntly expressed his gratitude . 
Harry whispered angrily : 
- Please ! 
Please shut up . 
If the Dursleys heard something , if they knew you were here 
- Harry Potter , he asked if he could help Dobby ? Sir , Dobby has heard of his greatness , but for his goodness , Dobby never knew 
Harry felt his face burning hot : 
- What you heard about my greatness is just a bunch of rumors . 
I do not even get to the top of the class at Hogwarts . 
The best is Hermione , her friend 
But Harry stopped , because he thought of Hermione as heartbreaking . 
Dobby said reverently , his eyes flashing like balls : 
- Harry Potter is modest humble . 
Harry has not talked about winning the Who - Who - Who - knows - it 
- Voldemort ? 
Dobby raised two bat ears and moaned : 
- Sir , do not say that name , please do not say the name ! 
Harry hurriedly said : 
- Sorry . 
I know many people do not like . 
My friend Ron 
She stopped talking . 
Ron thought it hurt too . 
Dobby leaned over to Harry , his eyes looking like two car headlights . 
- Dobby heard that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord a second , only a few weeks ago and Harry escaped again ? 
Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly filled with tears . 
- Ah , sir ! 
He gasped , slowing his tears at the dirty corner of the pillow he was wearing . 
- Harry Potter is brave with me brave ! 
He has challenged how many dangers ! 
But Dobby came to protect Harry Potter , to warn you , even if it was later torn up in the Harry Potter oven door , do not return to Hogwarts anymore ! 
The room was silent , just the forked sound from the floor , and the distant voice of Uncle Vernon . 
Harry stammered : 
- C what ? 
I have to go back to school ! 
The school year will begin on September 1 . 
Just because of that I tried to endure . 
You do not know how . 
I do not belong here . 
I belong to your world - Hogwarts . 
- No , no , never ! 
Dobby shook his head so badly that his ears struck each other . 
It squealed : 
- Harry Potter must stay here if he wants to be safe . 
He is too great , too noble , unable to lose . 
If Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts , he will be in danger of death . 
Surprised Harry : 
- Why ? 
Dobby suddenly trembled , whispering : 
- Harry Potter , there is a conspiracy . 
A plot to make so many horrible happenings at Hogwarts - magic academy and magic - this year . 
Sir , Dobby has known that plot for months . 
Harry Potter can not put himself in danger . 
Sir , Harry Potter is too important . 
Harry asked immediately : 
- What are those terrible things ? Who plotted ? 
Dobby swallowed up a laugh and then went mad at his head . 
Harry grabbed the elf's arm to stop him , advising : 
- That is enough . 
You can not tell me . 
I understand . 
But why did you forewarn me ? 
Suddenly a thought that was not interesting turned up in Harry's mind . 
- Wait ! Does this have anything to do with Vol's excuse for the Who - knows - well ? Are not you ? 
Harry added hurriedly as Dobby's head tilted anxiously toward the wall . 
- You just shook your head or just nod . 
Dobby slowly shook his head . 
- No - Who - knows - who - is - there , sir 
But Dobby's eyes widened and it seemed to give Harry a cue . 
However , Harry did not understand at all . 
- That person has a brother , right ? 
Dobby shook his head , his eyes wide open . 
Harry said : 
" Then I do , I can not think of anyone else who could have caused horror at Hogwarts . 
I mean , first of all Dumbledore you know Dumbledore , right ? 
Dobby lowered his head : 
- Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had . 
Sir , Dobby knows that . 
Dobby thought that Dumbledore's power was on par with Who - Who - Know - Who's power - at that time of his greatest strength . 
But sir , there are powers that Dumbledore does not have power without a good sorcerer 
Dobby jumped out of bed , grabbed Harry's desk lamp , and thumped himself in the head with a rattling noise . 
The lower floor suddenly fell silent . 
Two seconds later , Harry heard his heart beat and heard footsteps of Uncle Vernon go to the corridor : 
" Dursley must have forgot to turn off the television , he was the boy . 
- Hurry up ! 
Hiding in the closet ! 
Harry sneezed Dobby in the closet , closed the door , and threw himself on the bed , just as the door to the room was twisted open . 
Uncle Vernon face close to Harry's face , each voice of his uncle out through clenched teeth : 
- What the - what - is - the - demon ? 
You just ruined the joke of my jokes about Japanese golfers . Also , if you make another noise , you ' ll be born , you can not hear me ! 
Uncle stepped out of the room . 
Harry shivered and dropped Dobby out of the closet . 
It says : 
- See how this is ? 
See why I have to go back to Hogwarts ? That's the only place I have Oh , I think I have you . 
Dobby teased : 
- The friends did not even write to Harry Potter ? 
- I hope they are just this Well , 
Harry stared blankly : 
- How do you know my friends did not write to me ? 
Dobby confused : 
- Harry Potter do not be angry with Dobby . 
Dobby do it because 
- Did you stop my letter ? 
The elf quickly backed out of Harry's reach , saying : 
" Sir , Dobby keep them here . 
He drew a thick envelope from the pillow he was wearing . 
Harry could recognize Hermione's sarcastic strokes , Ron's crooked swoop , and a scrawling paper that looked like the work of Hogwarts keeper Hagrid . 
Dobby blinked at Harry : 
- Harry Potter should not be angry Dobby hope if Harry Potter thinks his friends have forgotten Harry Potter may not want to return to school anymore 
Harry did not listen , he dug into the letter , but Dobby jumped out of his reach . 
" Sir Potter , Harry Potter will receive these letters , promising Dobby Harry Potter will not return to Hogwarts anymore . 
Oh , that's a danger you should not confront ! 
Please promise not to come back again ! 
Harry said angrily : 
- Are not . Give me some letters from my friend ! 
The sad elf said , 
Dobby jumped to the door , opened it , and drove down the stairs . 
Harry followed the elf . 
- So Harry Potter did not give Dobby a choice . 
Before Harry could react , Dobby jumped to the door , opened it , and drove down the stairs . 
Harry followed the elf , trying not to make a noise , his mouth dry , his stomach twitched . 
He jumped past the last six steps of the stairs , landed on the rug as gently as a cat , looked around for Dobby . 
Uncle Vernon's voice came from the dining room . 
- Mr. Mason , please tell Petunia a funny story about the American sewers . 
She wanted to listen 
Harry ran through the corridor into the kitchen , feeling his intestines were gone . 
Aunt Petunia's great dessert cake with ice cream and sugar droplets hovering near the ceiling . 
Dobby hides in the corner of the cupboard . 
Harry choked : 
- do not ! 
Please do not kill me 
- Harry Potter must say he will not return to school anymore 
- Dobby , please 
- He said 
- I can not 
Dobby gave Harry a tragic look . 
- Then Dobby must do , for the sake of Harry Potter , sir . 
The cake dropped to the floor causing a resounding echo . 
The cream splashed on the walls and windows when the plate broke . 
With a whip , Dobby vanished . 
There was a scream from the dining room , and Uncle Vernon rushed to the kitchen to meet Harry , standing like a scarecrow , from head to toe filled with Aunt Petunia's pie . 
At first , Uncle Vernon seems to find the way to fill things up for the past . ( Just a little child . 
Meet the stranger it was scary , so we kept it upstairs . ) He frantically moved Mason and wife back to the dining room , assuring Harry that when Mr. and Mrs. Mason had left , they would unmask her One piece to live on , then give it a wipe . 
Aunt Petunia had to whip ice cream from the freezer , and Harry , still shaking , began to scrub the kitchen floor . 
Uncle Vernon should also have the opportunity to do him with Mason , if not the devastated owl . 
Aunt Petunia had just brought the candy box out after dinner , when an ugly owl broke through the dining room window , dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason's head , and soared through the window . that disappears . 
Mrs. Mason screamed like a scream of the Death Note and ran away from the house screaming about the madman . 
Mr. Mason just lingered enough to ask if this was an interesting joke to tell the Dursleys that his wife was afraid of dead birds , regardless of their shape and size . 
As Uncle Vernon approached Harry , his little eyes sparkled with malicious glances . 
Harry stood in the kitchen , clutching the wiping cloth to stand firmly . 
Uncle the letter that the owl brought , hissing evil : 
- read ! read it ! 
Harry took the letter . That's not a happy birthday card . 
Dear Potter , 
We have just received intelligence that the Spell has just been used at his place of residence at nine o ' clock twelve minutes tonight . 
As you know , adolescent wizards are not allowed to do magic outside the school , and if you do any more magic you will be kicked out of school . ( Juvenile Witch Justice Act , 1875 , para . C ) 
We also urge you to remember that any magical activity that has the potential to cause a member of the Muggle community to commit serious offenses is a violation of section 13 of the Confidentiality of the Conference . International Warlock . 
Happy Holidays ! 
Sincerely , 
Mafalda Hopkirk 
Office used the wrong magic 
Ministry of Magic . 
Harry raised his eyes from the letter , choking . 
A frenzy of mad dancing in Uncle Vernon's eyes as he said , 
- You did not tell me you were not allowed to use magic outside of school . 
You forgot to say you are confused 
Uncle Harry was like a giant hound , all the teeth . 
- okay , I ' ll tell you , baby , I ' ll lock you up , you ' ll never go back to that school again , and if you're going to use magic to escape , they ' ll chase you ! 
And he laughed like a madman , stepping Harry upstairs . 
Uncle Vernon's words were no less bad . 
The next morning , the hired man closed the bars on Harry's window . personally stabbed a cat hole on the door of Harry's bedroom , to give some food to him in the room , 
three times a day . 
They just let Harry out of the room to do the cleaning in the morning and evening . 
In addition , it is locked in the room . 
Three days later , the Dursleys showed no sign of reducing their sentence , and Harry could not see any way out of that traumatic state . 
He lay down on the bed watching the sun go down the window , and wondered what would happen to him . 
If it uses magic to get out , what benefit would it be , since it would be kicked out of Hogwarts . So life at Number Four Privet Drive Road was down to worse than ever . 
Now , when the Dursleys knew they would not be awakened in the middle of the night like bats , Harry lost his only weapon . 
Maybe Dobby saved Harry from the horrible things happening at Hogwarts , then Harry would probably starve to death . 
The latching cat's lingering cowl and Petunia's aunt appeared , pushing a can of boxed soup into the room . 
Harry's stomach was empty so he jumped out of bed and grabbed the soup . 
The ice is as cold as ice , but it tastes half empty . 
Then he walked across the room to the Hedwig cage , picking up pieces of vegetables in the bottom of the cup , and putting it into Hedwig's empty trough . 
The ruffled feathers , throwing Harry a look of extreme disgust . 
Harry bitterly said : 
- I do not eat is not useful . 
We only have that much . 
He put the cup next to the cat hole and went to bed , feeling hungry than when he had not eaten . 
Assuming it is still alive for four more weeks but can not go back to Hogwarts ? 
Do not know whether the school has anyone to find out why it did not return to the school ? 
Will he or she have enough power to get Dursley to go to school ? 
Dark room . 
Tired , the stomach scratched , the mind went on unanswered questions , Harry fell asleep sleep . 
Dobby said : Sir , Harry Potter is in there to be safe . 
She dreamed she was taken to a zoo exhibition , in a cage with a sign , saying : FISHERMAN YOUNG . 
The frogs ' eyes were on the back of the bars , it was there , on the bed of straw , hungry . 
He saw Dobby's face in the crowd , screaming for help , but Dobby said , Sir , Harry Potter is in there to be safe . , disappears . 
Then the Dursley family appeared and Dudley shook the shack , shaking it , laughing at it . 
- Stop it ! 
Harry murmured as the rattle echoed through his aching head . 
- leave me alone Im all I am trying to sleep 
He opened his eyes . 
The moon is shining through the bars . 
And somebody was staring at him through the window pavements : a long , long - haired , red - haired face . 
Outside the main window is Ron Weasley . 
Chapter 3 : BURROW CAMP 
Harry whispered : 
- Ron ! 
It crawls to the window , pushes the glass door to speak through the bars . 
- Ron , how are you ? 
That makes an extraordinary effect . 
Harry gaped at the sight . 
Ron was leaning through the window of a blue car that was standing in the air . 
Sitting in the front seat of the car were Fred and George , Ron's twin sons , who grinned at Harry . 
George asked : 
- How are you , Harry ? 
Ron also asked : 
- What's up ? 
Why do not you reply to your message ? 
I invited you to my house a dozen times , and then today my father went to work to say he was sent warning letters for using magic before the Muggle . 
- Not how I do But how do you know ? 
- He works at the Ministry of Magic . 
You know we're not allowed out of school 
Harry stared at the car , saying , 
- You look so luxurious ? 
- Well , this does not count . 
We just borrowed it . 
It's my car , we do not have any magic . 
But this Harry , spell in front of the Muggle in which we live together 
- I told you I did not do But now it takes a long time to explain Well , you can tell Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and will not let me go back to school To Obviously , I can not do my own liberation , because the Ministry of Magic would think it was the second spell I did in three days , 
Ron said : 
Ron said no more babble . 
We came to bring you home . 
- do not say babble again Harry . 
We came to bring you home . 
- But you can not take the spell out of me ! 
- Need to do it . 
Said Ron , nodding toward the front bench , grinning : 
- You forget who you go with ? 
Fred threw a rope to Harry , telling him , 
- The clamping force of the track is not ! 
Harry tied the rope tightly to a wooden bar saying , 
" If Dursleys would wake me up , I would have died . 
Fred and car engine : 
- do not be afraid . 
Take back 
Harry backed into the darkness beside the owl . 
Hedwig seemed to be aware of the importance of this matter and remained silent . 
The car is picking up at every turn . 
Then suddenly , Fred drove into the air , and with a loud crack , the shock absorbers snapped out of the window . 
Harry ran back to the window , staring at the wooden sticks that were dangling in the ground . 
Ron rushed into the car , but there was no sound in the Dursleys bedroom . 
When Ron had finished loading the logs , Fred pulled back to Harry's bedroom window . 
Said Ron : 
- Jump in the car ! 
- But my Hogwarts - wand , broom 
- Where are they ? 
Locked in the closet under the stairs , I could not get out of this room . 
From the front seat next to Fred , George said , 
- No big deal . 
Harry , get out ! 
George and Fred were gleaming like cats , climbing through Harry's window . 
Harry thought , I had to say hello , when George looked in his pocket and pulled out a normal hairpin and began to floss the keyhole . 
Fred said , 
- Many witches still say that the Muggle clutches only take time , but we think that these skills are worth learning , even if it is a little slow . 
A small chirp sounded and the door burst open . 
George said softly : 
- So we went to pick up the chest for you , and you are all the things you need in the room to give to Ron ! 
Harry also whispered to the two Weasley brothers as they turned down the dark stairs : 
- Beware of the last step , it creaks . 
Harry stumbled across the room , wrapped up his belongings and passed the window to Ron . 
Then she ran back to Fred and George carrying the chest up the stairs . 
Harry suddenly heard Vernon cough . 
Fred gasped : 
- Get a little bit more . push one more 
Harry and George put down the chest , sliding it through the window into the car . 
George whispered : 
- Done ! go ! 
But Harry just climbed up the window sill and suddenly a loud thud sounded behind him . 
And followed by the voice of Uncle Vernon's thunder : 
- BABY BABY ! 
- Death ! 
I forgot Hedwig ! 
Harry jumped back into the room when the corridor lights come on . 
He took Hedwig's cage , popped out of the window , passed out to Ron . 
Just as it was climbing to the top of the closet to climb out of the window , Uncle Vernon roamed the door unlocks that door burst open . 
For half a second , Uncle Vernon stood in the doorway ; Then the phalanx uttered a roar , sounded like a mad buffalo , and kneed at Harry , grasping his ankle . 
Ron , Fred , and George hurriedly clenched Harry's hand and pulled it to his feet . 
Uncle Vernon roared : 
- Petunia ! 
It's running away ! IT IS RUN ! 
But the Weasley brothers pulled each other so hard that Harry's leg was shoved out of Uncle Vernon's grip - Harry got in the car . 
It close the door 
Ron cried : 
- Fred , drop your feet ! 
So the car zoomed to the moon . 
Harry could not believe it - he was free . 
He pulled the windows of the car down , the night breeze sliding through his hair , and he looked down at the rooftops on the diminutive Privet Drive . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia and Dudley stood by the windows of her bedroom , stunned to silence . 
Harry screamed : 
- See you next summer ! 
The Weasleys burst into laughter and Harry sat down neatly in the chair , grinning to his ear . 
He told Ron : 
- Drop Hedwig away , he can fly with us . 
Long time no chance to flap wings . 
Hedwig flew out of the car window to glide at the children like a ghost . 
George handed Ron's hairpin open the door , and just a moment later , Hedwig flew out of the car window to glide behind the kids like a ghost . 
Asked Ron impatiently : 
- Star ? How about the story , Harry ? 
Harry told the Weasley brothers about Dobby , the warning that the elf gave Harry and the umbrella about the cake . 
When it was finished , people were silent for a long time in horror . 
Fred finally said , 
- very suspicious . 
George agrees : 
- Definitely a tricky game ! 
So in the end , the plotter's name does not even say it ? 
Harry said : 
- I think it's impossible to say . 
I told him , every time he was about to reveal something that it was back to the wall . 
Harry saw Fred and George looking at each other . 
She asked : 
- Do you think it's cheating on you ? 
Fred said , 
- okay , in short - the elves themselves have miracles , but they can not use magic without the permission of the master . 
I guess someone sent Dobby to stop me coming back to Hogwarts . 
Probably someone's joke . 
Do you think there is someone in the school who does not like you ? 
- Yes . 
Harry and Ron immediately exclaimed . 
Harry explained : 
- Draco Malfoy . 
She hates me . 
George turned around : 
- Draco Malfoy ? 
Lucius Malfoy's child ? 
Harry replied , 
- Sure , they are not very popular then ? 
What ? 
George says : 
- Did you hear him talk about him ? 
He is a supporter of the Who - knows - well - knows - well . 
Fred looked back at Harry and added , 
- And when the Who - knows - who - is - gone , Lucius Malfoy reappeared , saying that he did not intentionally follow that person . 
Cacao Ba thinks he is in the vicinity of the Know - Who - Know - Who . 
Harry had heard about the Malfoy family before , so it did not surprise him . 
Compared to Malfoy , Dudley is a kind , sensitive , thoughtful kid . 
Harry said : 
- Do not know if Malfoy is raising any elf ? 
Fred said , 
- Anyone who owns the elf is also of the noble family of wealthy . 
George added : 
- Oh , you always wished we had an elf to iron our clothes . 
But all that we have is an old ghost sitting up in the loft and all the ghosts and ghosts fleeing the garden . 
The elves are only found in ancient manor houses , castles , or other such places ; I do not want to find an elf at my house 
Harry was silent . 
Based on the fact that Malfoy always had the best of everything , his family would have been rich in rupture ; Harry could imagine Malfoy chafing around in a large manor house , sending a servant in the house to stop Harry from returning to school at Hogwarts . That sounds so good with what Malfoy likes to do . 
Was he stupid enough to believe in Dobby ? 
Said Ron : 
- Anyway , we are very pleased to have you pick up . 
I was very worried when I did not receive any response from you . 
At first I thought it was Errol's fault 
- Errol ? 
- Our owl . 
It's old - fashioned . This is not the first time it has not arrived . 
Let's try to borrow Hermes 
- Who ? 
Fred answers from the front bench : 
- The owl that your parents bought for Percy when he was the leader ! 
Ron Coal : 
- But Percy did not lend . 
The image says it needs it . 
George pensive : 
Mr. Percy behaved strangely throughout the summer . 
He sent a lot of letters and closed the door in the room . That is , the photo spent a lot of time to polish the badge Brother Leader Fred , he drives a little far west . 
George pointed the compass on the dashboard . 
Fred turned the wheel . 
Harry asked : 
- So do you know if you take the car ? 
- Oh no . 
Said Ron : 
- I'm working tonight . 
Hope we can return to the safe house without being noticed by the cheek we were riding it . 
- By the way , what did your father do at the Ministry of Magic ? 
- Three of Ron's most boring work is the misuse of the muggles . 
- What department ? 
- A muggle - themed mansion that was made of magic , even if it was a house or a Muggle market . 
For example , last year , an old witch died , and her tea set was sold to an antique shop . 
Then there is a Muggle bought home and made tea invite friends . 
Is it a nightmare That you have to stay overtime for weeks ? 
- What happened ? 
- The jar of hot tea warms all over the place , making him in the hospital with a clamped nose stick . 
Three went crazy - at that time there were only three with an old witch named Perkins - so the two of them had to juggle the memory of doing something like that to solve the job . 
- But your father's car 
Fred smiled : 
- Yes , I love everything about the Muggle people . 
Our warehouse is filled with Muggle children . 
He took them off , allowed them , and assembled them . 
If he searched the house , he would have to arrest him . 
This makes the cheek mad . 
George looked down through the windshield , saying , 
- The main road . 
Ten minutes or so we arrived in the middle of the night , it started to light 
A bright pink light shining on the eastern horizon . 
Fred lowered the car , Harry could see the fields and the trees . 
George says : 
- I'm not far away from the village . 
Ottery Street in Catchpole . 
The car went lower and lowered . 
The edge of the bright red sun now radiated through the trees . 
Fred said , 
- Touch the ground ! 
With a slight bounce , they touch the ground safely . 
They had to land next to a shoddy garage in a small courtyard . 
And for the first time , Harry saw Ron's house . 
A table on the ground near the sign : THE BURROW 
It looks like it used to be a very large stone pens , but after this was added a room , a room there , until it became several floors and crooked as if it had to be supported by magic . color ( which , Harry said , dare ! ) . 
On the roof of the red tile is the four or five chimneys . 
A table on the ground near the sign : THE BURROW . 
Flapping the front door is rubber boots and a very old cauldron . 
In the yard are many chubby chickens are cataract surgery . 
Said Ron : 
- That's it ! Not much spending . 
Harry thought of the house at Privet Drive , happily saying : 
- Great ! 
They came out of the car . 
Fred said , 
- Now we go upstairs , very smoothly , and wait until my mother calls down to eat breakfast . 
At that time , Ron , I just launched down the stairs , Mama , who's the last night ? . 
I will be very happy to see Harry again and no one will mind if we drive the car . 
Said Ron : 
- it's correct . Follow me , Harry . 
I sleep in the attic 
But Ron's face turned blue again , his eyes glaring at the house . 
The other three gathered around it . 
Mrs Weasley was crossing the yard , her footsteps made chickens run wild , and for a woman of low , plump , fair - skinned face , she looked so much like a bared tiger This time it's worth paying special attention . 
Fred cried : 
- ASIAN . 
George says : 
- Okay . 
Mrs. Weasley stopped in front of the children , her hands on her hips , staring from one sin to the other . 
She wears a flower apron and a wand sticks out at the apron pocket . 
She said : 
- That's it ! 
- Good morning ! 
George said in a voice that clearly believed he was the voice of triumph . 
Mrs. Weasley said in a deadly murmur : 
- Do you know how worried she is ? 
" We apologize to you , but you see , we have to 
All three of Weasley's sons were taller than their mothers , but they all shook their heads when Mrs. Weasley's outburst exploded : 
- empty bed ! 
There is no message ! 
Dare to take the car to go to Where the accident happened Micky crazy crazy Do not you think of your mother ? No , never in my life . Just wait for the three of us to fly back . We both , Bill , Charlie , and Percy , never hurt you like this . 
Fred mumbled : 
- Leader Percy ! 
Mrs. Weasley yelled , poking a finger at Fred's chest : 
- THE CHILD IS A PERCENT OF PERCY IS A FRIEND THAT KNOWS IT ! 
Do you know that there may have been an accident ? 
May have been seen ? 
Can the three children lose their jobs ? 
Time passes heavy . 
Mrs. Weasley scoffed at the hoarse voice and turned to Harry , who was now standing back . 
She said : 
- I am very happy to meet you , dear Harry , I go to the house and eat breakfast nhé ! 
She turned away and Harry , anxiously glancing at Ron , saw him nod , daring to follow Mrs. Weasley . 
The kitchen is small and cramped . 
In the middle of the room there was a wooden table that was polished with chairs around . 
Harry sat down on the edge of a chair and looked around . 
Now he's never been in a witch's house . 
The clock on the opposite wall has a needle and no number at all . 
Around the clock are the words : Tea time , hours for chickens , and Late for hours ! 
Books stacked three layers on the hearth , books like : Cheese Charms , the charm of baking art , and the party ready for a minute - it's a miracle ! And if Harry's ears do not cheat on him , the radio near the sink will announce the next show : " Nice Hour , " with famous witch singer : Celestina Warbeck . 
Mrs. Weasley was busy , cooking her breakfast without being spotted , throwing her angry glances at her sons , throwing sausages in her pan , occasionally murmuring things like : What do you think ? and never believe it 
Unloading eight or nine sausages , Harry assured her : 
- You do not scold me , dear . 
My uncle and I are always worried about you . 
Last night we both talked , two of you personally to pick up children if the Friday that I did not write back to Ron . 
But indeed , ( now she added three scrambled eggs to it ) flies on an illegal car across half of the country - anyone can see the children . 
He flicked his wand neatly into the pile of pots in the pot , the plates washed themselves , and lightly clattered to each other . 
Fred said , 
- It's cloudy , mother . 
Mrs. Weasley : 
- eating , then shut up . 
George said : 
" Mommy , they're starving Harry 
- You too ! 
Mrs. Weasley left , but her voice was softened and she started cutting bread and buttering for Harry . 
At that moment , the attention center shifted to a tiny red - haired character in a long nightgown ; She appeared at the kitchen door , cried a little and then ran back out . 
Ron whispered to Harry : 
- Ginny , my sister . 
During the summer it only refers to you . 
- Oh , I'm asking for your autograph , Harry . 
Fred said with a grin , but met his mother's eyes , so he closed his eyes to his plate , without saying any more . 
And no words anymore 
was added until four discs were clean , in a surprisingly short time . 
Fred finally set down his fork and yawned : 
- Insert ơi ! 
Too tired . 
I go to sleep and 
Ms Weasley said : 
- I can not sleep ! 
It's my fault to stay awake all night . 
You have to go to the garden clean ghost dust for cheeks ; They are filled up . 
- Oh , my mother 
She turned to Ron and George : 
- Two children too . 
But to Harry , she said : 
" You can go to bed , Harry , you do not have to show me to fly you in the car ! " 
But Harry felt very alert to say so : 
- Sir , help me Ron . 
I have not seen how to clean ghost dust 
Ms . Weasley said : 
" You're good , baby , but it's a boring job . To see what Lockhart said about the subject 
And from the heap on the fireplace , she pulled out a thick book . 
George whined : 
- Mama , we know how to clean the ghost in the garden 
Harry looked at the cover of the book in Mrs. Weasley's hand . 
The yellow lettering on the top of the book cover is : Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Treating Garden Harmers . 
The front cover has a large picture of a handsome witch with wavy yellow hair and blue eyes . 
As usual in the wizarding world , people in motion pictures ; The wizard , whom Harry guessed as Gilderoy Lockhart , blinked at everyone . 
Mrs. Weasley smiled at him . 
She said : 
- Oh , he was wonderful . 
You know how to handle the damage to his garden , this is a great book 
Fred whispered but sounded very clear : 
- Mucky cheeks ! 
Mrs. Weasley's cheeks blushed , saying : 
- Fred , do not be funny . 
Well , if you think you know better than Lockhart , just go and do it yourself ; And if the cheeks go to check but also see a ghost dust in the garden , then the soul . 
The Weasley brothers walked out , yawning and muttering , Harry huddled behind . 
The garden is wide , and in Harry's eyes this is a garden . 
The Dursleys certainly did not like it : full of weeds , unmistakable grass , full of bending trees along the walls - trees Harry had never seen anyone grow in a flower garden , and there was even one . green pond full of imitation . 
When crossing the lawn , Harry said to Ron : 
- You know , Muggles also have lobster in the garden . 
Ron leaned down , put his head in a peony , said : 
- Oh , you also see what they call ghosts , looks like Santa little dwarf squirrel carrying small rods 
With a fierce convulsion , the sambarry shivered , and Ron stood up straight . 
He smiles : 
- this is a ghost . 
Ghost clatter : 
- Drop me out ! 
Let me out ! 
Certainly this ghost is not like Santa Claus at all . 
It's small but tough , with a bald head that looks like a potato . 
Ron grasped it in his hand and stretched out his arms as he struggled to his feet , his legs full of stone spikes . 
Ron grabbed his ankles , pushed it back down , and said , 
- You must do this . 
Ron raised the ghost up high over the head ( ghost screaming : Release me ! ) And began to turn it like a cowboy looped to throw away the bush . 
Seeing Harry's expression , Ron added : 
- I did not hurt him . 
Just make it so dizzy that you can not find your way back to the maze . 
Ron let go of the ghost , so the ghost immediately soared up into the air about six or seven meters , then dropped a bag on the field beyond the hedge . 
Fred said , 
- I do not ! 
I bet your ghost is far away than that tree . 
Harry quickly understood that there should not be too much mercy on the ghosts . 
When it decided to drop the first spade it caught the other side of the hedge , the spit , feeling its softness , snapped its razor - sharp teeth into Harry's finger . 
It was hard to get the ghost out , and then it was 
" Well , Harry , " he said , " it's just a few yards away . " 
Soon , the sky was full of scattered ghosts . 
George grabbed five of the six ghosts , saying , 
- Look , they are not very smart either . 
Just heard the cleaning ma ghost dust in the garden they are stuck together to head up . 
And they have kept the secret that they have learned to escape to hide . 
A few moments later , the ghosts of dust in the field began to descend into discrete lines , their small shoulders hunched . 
As they watched them disappear behind the hedge across the field , Ron said , 
- They will come back . 
They love it here too , Ba too hands with them ; They said they were funny 
At that time , the door slammed . 
George exclaimed : 
- Come on ! 
Three are on ! 
They hurried through the yard and went home . 
Mr. Weasley was sitting in a chair in the kitchen , his glasses removed and his eyes closed . 
He was a thin man , bald , but his hair was as red as the hair of any of his children . 
He was wearing a green sorceress robe , a dirt - stained shirt . 
He murmured : 
- It was a terrible night ! 
He held the teapot when everyone began to sit down and gather around . 
- nine searches . 
Nine ! 
Mr. Mundungus Fletcher also tried to cast a spell on his father when he turned away 
Mr. Weasley sipped a large sip of tea and sighed . 
- What are you looking for ? 
- Three confiscated a few keys to shrink and a warm bite . 
He yawned : 
- There are some scandals , but not in my office . 
There are too many hackers , Mortlake to investigate . 
Thank goodness it was the Party of Experimental Charms 
George asked : 
- Who do you take the key to shrink what do you do ? 
Mr. Weasley sighed : 
- Not to fool the Muggle people . 
Give them a key that they shrink until they have nothing else to go to when they need it . Of course , it's hard to blame anyone , because no Muggle people think Their retreat - they insist they lose their keys . 
They do not believe in magic , while magical things are happening in front of them . But there are things that many of us take to cast spells , you can not believe it . 
Mrs. Weasley appears , holding a long stick like a sword 
- SUGGESTIONS ? 
Mrs. Weasley appears , holding a long stick like a sword . 
Mr. Weasley's eyes flared open . 
He looked at his wife with guilt : 
- X car , baby ? 
- Oh , car , brother Arthur . 
Mrs. Weasley said , her eyes bright . 
Imagine a witch who buys a rusty old car and tells his wife he just wants to take it off to see how it works , while he actually fucks it . 
Mr. Weasley blinked . 
- Well , sweetheart , I think you ' ll realize that he did it perfectly legitimately . 
Even if he was honest with his wife , he could have done better . He would find in the law a loophole . If he had no intention of driving a car , do not fly 
Mrs. Weasley cried out : 
- Arthur , when you wrote that law , you must deliberately left the door open ? 
So you can do the patchwork of three Muggle trash in his warehouse . 
And let me tell you , Harry came here , this morning , in the car that he did not intend to fly ! 
Mr. Weasley was bewildered : 
- Harry ? 
Harry ? 
He looked around , saw Harry , and jumped up . 
- Devil spirit ! Is Harry Potter ? 
Great to meet you . 
Ron told his family about a lot 
Mrs. Weasley continued to shout , 
- Your sons drive that car to Harry's house and return that night ! 
What are you talking about ? 
Mr. Weasley was eager : 
- Really ? 
Does it fly well ? 
Daddy wants to say 
He stuttered as Mrs. Weasley's eyes flashed anger . 
- That is very wrong , you are wrong 
While Mrs. Weasley was irritated , Ron whispered to Harry : 
- Just let the two grandparents deal with it . Let me just show you my bedroom . 
Two out of the kitchen , down a narrow corridor , to a stairway to the left . 
The winding stairs ran through the house . 
On the third floor , a door opened . 
Harry caught a glimpse of brown eyes gazing at it , and the door slammed shut . 
Said Ron : 
- Ginny . 
You do not know , the child is so shy that it is so strange . 
Usually when it is quiet mouth . 
They climbed two more floors , then came a painted door with a small sign reading RON ROOM . 
Harry walked in , his head nearly touching the sloping ceiling . 
He blinked . 
Like going to a smelter : almost everything in Ron's room is overwhelmingly orange : orange bed sheets , orange walls , even the ceiling is orange . 
Then Harry noticed that Ron had covered most of the wall paper with the plates of a group of seven male and female witches , all dressed in orange robes , holding a broom , waving their hands . 
Harry asked : 
- Your Quidditch team ? 
Ron said , pointing at an orange bedclothes decorated with two black C - letters and a quick - fire cannonball : 
- Chudley Cannnos . ranks ninth in the league . 
Ron's maniacal books are thrown into the corner of the room , next to the comics that seem to have the same title as The Adventures of Martin Miggs , the Muggle Maniac . 
Ron's wand set on a mouth full of tadpole - filled fish baskets on a window sill , next to his dark gray mouse , the Scabbers , who was falling asleep in a sunny patch . 
Harry walked through the bag of the Self - Tag on the floor and looked out at the tiny window . 
It can be seen in the field far and wide , a gang of moths sneaking past the Weasleys , one by one . 
Then he turned to look at Ron , who was looking at him nervously , as if waiting for his opinions . 
Ron said quickly : 
- It's a bit small . 
Not with your room in the Muggle family . so I was right under the place of the ghost on the floor ; He kept taping and groaning 
But Harry grinned . 
- this is the most beautiful house I've ever been to ! 
Ron's ear blushed . 
Chapter 4 : PHYSICAL AND WELFARE 
Living on the Burrow Farm is another mile away from Privet Drive . 
The Dursleys love everything orderly and orderly ; The house of the Weasley family exploded with all sorts of strange and unexpected things . 
Harry was shocked when he first looked at the mirror on the mantel in the kitchen . 
The mirror shouted : 
- Put your clothes down , scars ! 
The ghost on the top floor is up or down the water pipe whenever he feels silent . 
Small explosions in George and Fred's bedroom are considered normal . 
However , what Harry found most unusual in his life at Ron's house , was not the parable or parable . What Harry found most strange was that everyone in Ron's house seemed to like it . 
Mrs. Weasley made a fuss about the status of her socks and every meal brought her to the fourth plate . 
Mr. Weasley always wanted Harry to sit next to him at dinner , so he could throw down the heap of questions about life with Muggles , 
It explains things like how the plug and the postal service work . 
When Harry explains to him about using the phone , he says : 
- Attractive ! 
Real love ! 
Indeed the Muggles have found out how many ways to live without magic . 
A week after it arrived at the Burrow Farm , Harry received a letter from Hogwarts . 
It was a beautiful sunny day . 
He and Ron went down to the breakfast kitchen and saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny sitting at the table . 
When Harry saw that Ginny immediately poured porridge into the floor crying out . 
Ginny had to knock things down when Harry stepped into the room . 
She crawled under the table to pick up the cup and rise up with her face flushed like the sun . 
As if not knowing that , Harry sat down and took a piece of toast from Mrs. Weasley's hand . 
- There is a school letter . 
Mr. Weasley said , giving Harry and Ron two identical envelopes , with yellow parchment , in green ink . 
- Dumbledore knew you were here , Harry . 
The old man did not miss anything . 
As Fred and George stepped in , still wearing their pajamas , Mr. Weasley added : 
- Two children also have letters . 
For a few minutes the room was quiet because the children were busy reading the letter . 
Harry's letter told him to pick up Hogwarts as usual , at King's Cross Station on September 1 . 
There is also a list of new books that are needed for the upcoming school year . 
Second - year students should have : 
Book of Fundamentals , Grade 2 , by Miranda Goshawk 
Short Break for Gilderoy Lockhart's Goddess of Death 
Lang Thang with the Ghost of Gilderoy Lockhart 
Gilderoy Lockhart's Witchcraft 
Gilderoy Lockhart's Giant Sword 
Gilderoy Lockhart's Gatorade Tour 
Gilderoy Lockhart's Wanderer 
Gilderoy Lockhart's Year of the Snow 
Fred finished reading his catalog , and searched for Harry's book . 
- You also get all the Lockhart books ! 
The new Professor of Black Hawk Art is Lockhart's daredevil . That fish is a witch . 
Speaking of it , Fred caught his gaze , immediately bending down on his fork and eating his jam . 
George looked at his parents and said , 
- Buying books like this is costly . 
Lockhart's book is very busy 
- yes , we will . 
Mrs. Weasley said , but she looked worried . 
" I think maybe I should buy Ginny's supplies . " 
Harry asked Ginny , 
- Wow , you started Hogwarts this year ? 
She nodded , her face flushed to the brim of her bright red hair , and she put two elbows on the fork . 
Luckily no one saw it except Harry , because then Brother Huynh Percy stepped in . 
He was dressed up as the leader of the coat jacket . 
Percy said , 
- Hi all . 
It's beautiful today ? 
He sat down in the only empty chair in the kitchen , but immediately jumped up , picking up from the back of the chair an object Harry thought was a dusty gray brush - at least until Harry looked . The object was breathing , then he knew it was an owl . 
Shouted Ron : 
- Errol ! 
He picked up the lame pawn from Percy's hand and pulled out a letter under his wing . 
- It finally got Hermione's reply . 
I wrote to him that we would find a way to save you from the Dursleys . 
Ron took Errol to a pole in the back of the kitchen and tried to place the owl on it , but Errol slipped off the pole , so Ron laid it on a dry board , whispering : 
- Carpet too ! 
Then he opened Hermione's letter , reading aloud : 
Dear Ron , and dear Harry ( if you are there ) , 
I hope all is well and Harry is strong , and you have not done anything illegal to rescue him . 
Because , Ron , that just made Harry more troubled . 
I really do not know if Harry is okay , please tell me right away , but maybe you should use another owl , it's better because just one more mail , your owl spend the life always . 
Of course I'm busy doing homework . 
- How are you doing ? 
Ron screamed . 
- We are vacationing ! 
Then read on : 
and my parents will take me to London next Wednesday to buy new books for me . 
Or do we meet in the alley ? 
Write me what's going on , as soon as possible . 
Dear , Hermione . 
Mrs. Weasley began to clean the table . 
She said : 
- Oh , so also , parents also need to bring all the children to buy things for the children to prepare for admission . 
What are you going to do today ? 
Harry , Ron , Fred , and George are going up the hill , on which there is a lawn of the Weasley family . 
Around the lawn , trees grow thick , obscuring the view from the village below the valley , so children can practice Quidditch , as long as not fly too high . 
They can not use Quidditch balls , because the risk that the fledglings run and fly through the village , they are difficult to explain smoothly . 
Instead of the balls , they throw some apples to catch . 
Harry's Nimbus 2000 was taking turns , as it was obviously the best . 
Ron's old - fashioned swirling Star always flies away whenever he flies over the butterflies . 
Five minutes after breakfast , the bristles on their shoulders climbed up the hill . 
They asked if Percy wanted to go with them , but he told him he was busy . 
From day to day Ron's house , Harry only see him Percy at the meal only ; At other times he kept closing the door in the room . 
Fred grimaced : 
- May I know what pictures are busy ? Photos no longer available . 
Before Harry's arrival , the photo received the test results of the photo , twelve P . T . T . D , that picture is not gloating at all . 
Looking at Harry's face , George explained : 
- A regular witch . 
Bill was back at that time also twelve P . T . T . Do not smart his house there is another male leader here again . 
I can not bear the humiliation inferior photos . 
Bill was the eldest of the Weasley brothers . 
He , along with his second brother , Charlie , graduated from Hogwarts . 
Harry had never met him , but he knew Charlie was studying Romanian dragons and Bill was working for Gringotts , the Egyptian bank of witchcraft . 
George later said : 
- Do not know how parents can afford the cost of shopping for us this year . 
The five sets of Lockhart books ! 
And Ginny needed a new uniform and a wand and a few other things 
Harry did not say anything . 
It feels a bit miserable . 
His cheeks left him with a good fortune to be kept under the silver of the Gringotts Bank in London . 
Of course , it only uses that money in the wizarding world ; No one uses the Galleon gold coin , the Sickle coin and the Knut coin in the Muggle shop . 
She had never told the Dursleys about her account at Gringotts ; It is unlikely that those who still feared anything related to the witch now go scared of a pile of gold . 
On the morning of the fourth day , Mrs. Weasley woke the kids up early . 
After each of us had eaten six slices of cold bread , all dressed in , and Mrs. Weasley took a flower pot from the fireplace in the kitchen , gazing at the tub , sighing : 
- We are very little , Arthur . 
Today , I have to buy more , this is a priority ! 
Please go ahead , Harry . 
She brought the flowerpot to Harry . 
He glared at everyone , and everyone was staring at him . 
It stuttering : 
- What should I do ? 
Ron said , 
- Sorry , Harry , I forgot . 
She has never traveled with Floo powder . 
Mr. Weasley was surprised : 
- Never ? 
So how did last year get to the alley to buy equipment for children ? 
- Yes , I go by subway 
- Really ? 
Mr. Weasley expressed his eagerness : 
- Does that staircase automatically leap ? 
Namely how 
Ms . Weasley said : 
- Arthur , this is not the time to ask Floo powder is much faster , but the devil , if you have not used it before 
Fred said , 
- It will do it , mother . 
Harry , look at this before . 
Fred took a pinch of flour out of the flowerpot , stepping to stand beside the fireplace , throwing powder into the fire . 
The roar sounded , the fire turned blue jade , high above Fred's head . 
Then Fred stepped straight into the fire , shouting : Alley Xo ! and immediately disappeared . 
George then reached for a handful of Floo powder . 
Mrs. Weasley instructed Harry : 
- You speak very well baby , to make sure the child is the right grist 
Harry watched the fire grow and George was gone , anxiously asking : 
- what is it ? 
- Well , there are countless number of witches to choose from , you know , but if you speak clearly 
Mr. Weasley had picked up a handful of powder and told his wife : 
- Harry managed , do not mess it up , Molly . 
- But if you love , if it is lost , then I know how to say it with aunts it ? 
Harry reassured Mrs. Weasley : 
- They do not mind , uncle . 
Dudley would have thought that something stuck in a chimney was a devil's whack , do not worry about it . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
- Oh well , you can go after your uncle . 
This way , when you walk into the fire , you say where you want to go 
Ron continued : 
- Keep your elbows tight . 
Ms . Weasley added : 
- And close your eyes . to avoid soot 
Ron said : 
- do not be impatient . 
If you do not get the wrong oven 
- But do not panic and do not come out too soon ; Wait until you see Fred and George come out . 
Struggling to remember these words , Harry took a handful of Floo powder and walked over to the fireplace . 
He took a deep breath , scattered the powder on the fire , stepped forward ; the fire feels like a warm breeze ; He opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a cup of ash . 
It coughs : 
- H ha ha ha ha . 
It felt like it was sucked down into a giant sewer . 
It seemed to me that it was spinning - the roar was deafening . 
He tried to open his eyes but the whirlwind of blue flames made him so dizzy . 
Elbows it hit something so painful , he hastily closed his two elbows , still felt himself twisted and swept away . 
Now it felt the cold hand of someone slap her face . 
With his eyes peering through his glasses , Harry saw the rows of fireplaces smudging and glimpsing each other across the fireplaces - the salty sandwich stirring in his stomach - he closed his eyes and prayed for a pause . Done , and then 
It collapsed , hit a rock and felt its glass break a neat . 
Dumbfounded and scratched , he staggered up , holding the broken eyeglasses . 
She is alone , but she does not know where she is . 
It can only be said for sure that it is standing in a stone fireplace in a hut that looks like a dim lit witch shop - but nothing here seems to be in the catalog . Hogwarts school . 
A nearby glass shelf contained a wilted hand on a pillow , a bloodstained card , and a glassy eye . 
The ghost - like mask hanging on the wall also glared down at him , a human skeleton lying on the counter , and sharp rustles hanging from the ceiling . 
Even worse , through the old window of the shop , Harry could see a narrow , dark road , but it was not Alley Cross . 
A nearby glass shelf contained a wilted hand on a pillow , 
Harry thought he had to get out of here as soon as possible . 
At the tip of his nose he smoked the stone fireplace still hurts , Harry still trying to make way out the door so fast and quiet . 
But halfway through the glass , there appeared two people - one of whom was the one Harry did not want to see at all , the nose , the nose and the glass soot . 
That person is Draco Malfoy . 
Harry looked around quickly and saw the large black cabinet on the left . 
He immediately left the closet and closed the door , but still left a tiny gap to look out . 
A few seconds later , the doorbell rang and Malfoy stepped into the shop . 
The man who followed Malfoy was probably his father , and no one else was . 
He also looked pale , with sharp faces and gray eyes , like Malfoy . 
Malfoy crossed the room , ignoring the display . 
He shakes a bell on the counter , then goes back to his son : 
- Do not touch anything , Draco . 
Malfoy came to the glass eye . 
It says : 
- I thought you were going to buy me a present 
He tapped his finger on the counter : 
" Daddy said he would buy me a broomstick . " 
Malfoy stammered , angry : 
- What if I can not recruit a team ? 
Last year Harry Potter had a Nimbus 2000 . 
At Dumbledore's special permission , it was played for Gryffindor . 
It's not that good , it's not famous thanks to a stupid scar on the forehead 
Malfoy leaned down on a skull and looked at the skulls . 
- Everyone thinks it's smart , Potter is awesome with its scars and broomsticks 
Mr. Malfoy throws the child a look of repression : 
- I told you that at least a dozen times . 
And I want to remind you that it is not a good idea to be Harry Potter , it's not wise , especially when everyone in our circle sees it as a hero who has cleared the Dark Lord . 
An old man with a shrunken backside appeared behind the counter , clawing his smooth hair over his head . 
Borgin's tone was as smooth as his hair : 
" Good morning , Malfoy , to see you and Malfoy again . 
I would like to serve you and my brother . 
I would like to introduce him to just about today with affordable prices 
Mr Malfoy said : 
I have a few items at home that may be a nuisance to me , 
- Mr. Borgin , today I do not buy , that I sell . 
The smile wilted slightly on Borgin's face : 
- Sell ? 
Mr. Malfoy took a roll of parchment from his inner pocket , opening it to Mr. Borgin . 
- You must have heard that the Ministry is currently conducting more searches . 
I have some items at home that may be a nuisance to me , if the Department has ordered 
Mr. Borgins tied the glasses up to the bow and read the list : 
- Sir , certainly not dare to bother him . 
Mr. Malfoy's lips curled : 
- I have not been searched . 
The name Malfoy is still respected , but the Department is increasingly interested in the work of others . 
It is rumored that a new Muggles protection law is coming - certainly there is a stupid , dirty and mesmerized Arthur Weasley behind this case . 
Harry felt the branches twinkle . 
Mr. Malfoy continued to say : 
- and as you can see , some of this poison can make this happen 
Mr. Borgin said : 
- Sir , of course I understand . let me see 
Draco pointed at his dry hand on the pillow , interrupted : 
- I want to buy that ! 
Mr. Borgin dropped the list of Malfoy's father , hurried to run to Malfoy : 
- A ! 
Hands of Glory ! 
Just placing a candle in the hand will illuminate the person holding it , and only that person will see the light ! This is the true friend of the thieves and robbers ! 
Sir , your son is a cool guy . 
Mr. Malfoy said coldly , 
" I hope my son will be better off than a thief or a thief , Mr. Borgin . 
Mr. Borgin said , 
- Sir , I do not mean to offend , not at all 
Mr. Malfoy is even cooler : 
However , if its rank in school does not move , it is only worth stealing . 
Draco argued back . 
- Where is your fault ? 
The teachers are biased , there are pupils guts , baby Hermione Granger 
But Malfoy shouted : 
- I thought you should be humiliated because the children of the ordinary family do not know that magic defeated in the exams not ! 
Hiding in the closet , find out that Malfoy child just fluttered home , just angry , Harry gladly whispered : 
- deserved ! 
Mr. Borgin continued to say , 
- Nowhere is that , witch line is increasingly rare 
Malfoy's long nose sprouts up to the ball : 
- For me not ! 
Mr. Borgin lowered himself : 
" Oh , no , sir , not me , sir . 
Mr. Malfoy said : 
- Then , maybe we should go back to my list . 
I'm busy , Mr. Borgin . 
Today I have some important things to do in another place 
Two people embarked on another two . 
Harry looked at Draco tensely as he walked toward the closet , closer and closer to where Harry was hiding . 
Draco stopped to look at a very long rope , and read the card attached to a gorgeous cat - eye necklace and laughed . 
Note : Do not touch . Tortured - Takes possession of eighteen owners of Muggle , up to now . 
Draco turned his back and stood in front of the closet . 
He stepped forward , raising his hand to grasp the door knob , Malfoy's father's voice sounded at the counter : 
- Come on , Draco . 
When Draco left , Harry wiped his brow with his sleeve . 
" Good day , Mr. Borgin . 
I will wait for you to come to my manor to get the goods . 
As soon as the door closed behind Malfoy's father , Borgins lost his luster : 
- A day of prosperity for you , Mr. Malfoy , if it was just as rumored , he had sold less than half of what he had hidden in his manor . 
Mr. Borgin muttered something else that was not clear , then vanished into the room inside . 
Harry waited for a few more minutes to make room for him to come out , then , gently , he quietly climbed out of the closet , flicked through the glass shelves , and threw himself out of the store . 
Thinking about the glass on his nose , Harry looked around . 
It had fallen into a dark alley , apparently consisting of all the shops that served Dark Arts . 
The store it just left , Borgins & Burkes , looked like the biggest salons in the area , opposite it was a disgusting window displaying dry dry heads , and two doors back . Below is a large cage filled with giant spiders still alive wrinkles . 
The two sleek sorcerers were standing in the darkness of a door frame , watching him and chatting quietly . 
Frustrated , Harry hurried away , trying to keep his glasses neatly on his nose , hopelessly hoping that it could find a way out of this place . 
A wooden signboard hanging over a shop selling poisonous lights tells it to be the Knockturn alley . 
It would not help , as it has never heard of such a place . 
It was presumed that while we were in the Weasleys heater , with a mouth full of ashes , he pronounced the alley was not clear , just for this reason . 
Trying to keep calm , he asked himself what to do ? 
- straying hard ? 
An old sorceress stood in front of him , holding a tray full of scary things . 
A voice echoed in Harry's ear . 
An old witch standing in front of him , holding a tray full of scary things like the nails of people . 
She glanced at Harry , glancing up at the moss - clenched teeth . 
Harry stepped back . 
It stammered : 
- Thank you , I'm fine . 
I just 
- HARRY ! 
What are you doing here ? 
Harry jumped up . The witch is also startled , always pouring down his feet . 
Hagrid , the Hogwarts keeper , strode towards them . 
The curse of the witch hisses as the massive mass of Hagrid's lumpy body appears ; Through his old bamboo beard , sparkling black eyeballs looked out . 
Harry felt relieved , chokingly said : 
- Uncle Hagrid ! I lost Floo 
Hagrid grabbed Harry's neck and pulled it away from the witch , dropping the tray from his hands . 
When the two of us went to the alleyway , we heard the shriek of a shrieking shriek from behind . 
Out of the alleyway was the bright sun shining on Harry's head , and he saw in the distance the familiar snow - white stone house - Gringotts Bank : Hagrid had led Harry right at Alley Cross . 
- What a jerk ! 
Hagrid grumbled . 
He soothed Harry so hard that he almost jostled him into the empty box of dragon dung outside a drug store . 
" I do not know how much Knockturn Knockturn is doing , Harry , that dangerous place ! 
I do not want anyone to see me there 
- You know , my uncle . 
Harry said , clawing his head against his neck to dodge Hagrid's big hand and brush his soot on him . 
- I told you , I was lost But , what are you going to do ? 
Hagrid grunted : 
- Uncle is buying meat eating anti - eating meat . 
They damage the school's cabbage field too . you go alone ? 
Harry explained : 
- I'm on vacation with the Weasley family , but I'm lost them . 
You have to go find them 
Two people walking down the street . 
- Why do not you write me a letter ? 
Hagrid asked when Harry snapped away ( he had to jump three steps to catch up with his huge steps ) . 
Harry tells the story of Dobby and the Dursleys . 
Growled Hagrid : 
- Muggle bad ! 
I know that 
There is a voice called : 
- Harry ! 
Harry ! Come here ! 
Harry looked up and saw Hermione standing on the white stairs leading up to the Gringotts Bank . 
She ran down to meet her two nieces Harry , her thick brown hair flying down her back . 
- What's wrong with your glasses ? 
Hello Hagrid ! 
Oh , seeing you two is so wonderful Harry , are you planning to go to Gringotts Bank ? 
Harry said : 
" No , but we have to find the Weasley family first . " 
Hagrid grinned . 
- You must not look for work . 
Harry and Hermione looked around : the rowdy crowd in the crowded streets of sprinting was Mr. Weasley and the brothers Ron , George , Fred , and Percy . 
Mr. Weasley smiled and shook his bald head , 
- Harry ! 
Please pray that you do not go so far as a bladder Uncle ladies are worried about She is coming now . 
Asked Ron : 
- What is the source of the song ? 
Hagrid grins : 
Knockturn alley . 
Fred and George exclaimed : 
- All loss ! 
Ron can not hide jealousy : 
- We were never allowed to go there . 
Hagrid growled . 
- I do not think there is a scatter to it . 
At this moment Mrs. Weasley was swinging wildly toward them , one of her hands shaking her handbag , while Ginny was gripping her other hand . 
- Oh , Harry , darling Where are you now ? 
She gasped as she pulled out a large cloth brush and began to clean the soot on Harry's clothes , which Hagrid could not help . 
Mr. Weasley held Harry's glass up , gave it a wand , and handed it to Harry : the glass was as big as a new one . 
Mrs. Weasley kept Hagrid's hand tightening : 
- Knockturn alley ! 
Oh , Hagrid , if you can not find it 
Said Hagrid . 
- Well , let's go . 
Then he strode away , after greeting : 
- See you at Hogwarts ! 
The tall elders stood up on the busy street of shopping . 
Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they all climbed the steps of Gringotts Bank . 
- Can you guess who I saw at Borgin & Burkes ? It was Malfoy and his father . 
Mr Weasley's voice was suddenly heard behind them : 
- What did Lucius Malfoy buy ? 
- No , he hugged me . 
- So he's worried ! 
Mr. Weasley grinned , saying , 
- Well , I love Lucius Malfoy's troubles 
- Be careful , Arthur . 
That family loves it very much . 
You do not have to do too swinging hands forehead 
Mrs. Weasley abruptly interrupted her husband . 
At that time they were stepping into the bank , a goblin bowed to open the door . 
Mr Weasley , 
- Do you think you are not a rival to Lucius Malfoy ? 
At the time , the subject was distracted as Mr. Weasley saw Hermione's parents . 
They were restlessly standing by the long stall running across the marble halls , waiting for Hermione to introduce them to her family of friends . 
Mr. Weasley said cheerfully : 
- Are you a Muggle ? ! 
We must drink this new encounter ! 
What are you going to do ? 
Ah , grandparents change Muggle money Molly , look ! 
He showed his wife only a ten - pound note in the hands of Hermione's mother , Granger . 
The Weasley family and Harry are guided down by another demon . 
Harry said to Hermione : 
- I ' ll see you again soon . 
Wanting to get down to the silver cellar , they had to ride on rover - wheeled bogey wagons driving the rails through the tunnels beneath Gringotts Bank . 
Harry enjoyed the dizzying journey to the Weasley family's grave ; But when the silver cell was opened , it felt even more horrible when it got lost in Knockturn . 
Inside the silver cell , there was only a handful of Sickle's silver coins and only one gold Galleon . 
Mrs. Weasley fumbled for all the corners before scooping out all the baskets . 
Upon arriving at his silver cellar , Harry felt more miserable . 
He had to deliberately stand in the tunnel door , just to hide the pile in the cellar , hastily grabbing a fistful of silver for a leather bag . 
Back at the marble staircase of the bank , people scattered each one down . 
Percy muttered over the need for a new goose feather . 
Fred and George grabbed schoolmate Lee Jordan . 
Mrs. Weasley took Ginny to the old clothes shop , and Mr. Weasley insisted on getting the Granger to go in . The cauldron made a glass . 
Before taking Ginny away , Mrs. Weasley advised : 
- One more hour we will all meet at Phu Quy and Co Han shops to buy books for children . 
And do not go to Knockturn ! 
She called Fred and George behind them . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione strolled along the winding road . 
Grabbing money , money , money , humming in his pants pocket Harry demanded to be gone . 
Because the 
So , Harry bought three strawberry ice cream with peanut butter . 
They just wandered the streets just happily sucking ice cream , watching the attractive shops . 
Ron crouched at Chudley Cannon in a shop offering quality Quidditch sportswear , until Hermione pulled it off . 
They go buy ink and parchment at the next store . 
When we arrived at Gambol & Japes , they met Fred , George , and Lee Jordan who were stuffing their bags with fireworks . 
And in a decaying shop full of broken wands , balanced bales of iron , and old jackets seized with poison , they meet Percy burying her head in an extremely boring book . Interrupts are the Brothers reach for power . 
Ron peered over the book , reading aloud : 
- A study of Hogwarts leaders and their future careers . 
Play is also attractive 
Percy : 
- Get off now ! 
We left , Ron whispered to Harry and Hermione : 
" That's right , ambitious , Mr. Percy ! 
The plan is over and he wants to do it to the Minister of Magic 
An hour later , they went to Phu Quy and Co Han shops . 
It turned out not only the Weasley brothers , Harry and Hermione were the only ones to come here . 
Coming to the shop , they were amazed to see a crowd of red - black outside , trying to squeeze in . 
The cause of this event was a banner spreading across the top of the message window : 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
Will sign autobiography of him WHAT I LOVE 
Today at 12 : 30 pm to 4 : 30 pm 
Hermione screamed , 
" Oh , so can I meet him ? 
Most of our books are in his portfolio ! 
The crowd seemed to consist of Mrs. Weasley's age - old witches . 
A confused sorceress , standing at the door said : 
- Please do not push , do not forget to take care of books , this 
Ron , Harry and Hermione are in . 
People were standing at the end of the bookstore , where Lockhart was signing his book . 
Each quickly reached for a Book of Worship with the Witch and sneaked up to the top of the line , where the Weasley brothers were sitting with Granger . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
- Ah , you are here , good . Wait a minute , we ' ll meet him . 
She looks very nervous , keep on stroking hair forever . 
Gilderoy Lockhart slowly appeared in their sight as they inched forward . 
He sat at a table , surrounded by large portraits of himself , which winked and laughed at his white teeth with the crowd . 
Lockhart's flesh - colored skirt was the same as the color of his eyes , and the vertically conical hats held a corner in his wavy hair . 
A seemingly long dwarf was jumping around to take pictures of him with a black - and - white photograph of each vane of light flashing . 
As he backed away to choose a good shooting position , he shouted at Ron : 
- Avoid it ! This is a photo published in the Prophet Daily . 
Ron rubbed his aching old feet ; to speak : 
- Big stuff ! 
It reached Malfoy's ear . 
He raised his head . 
He saw Ron - then he saw Harry . 
He rolled his eyes . 
Then he stood up , and he said aloud , loudly : 
- THIS IS HARRY POTTER ! 
crowd split , whispered excitement . 
Lockhart leaned over , grabbed Harry's arm , pulled it up in front of the crowd . 
When Lockhart shook his hand to take the picture , Harry's face heated up . 
He shot the camera as crazy , sprayed smoke in the face of the Weasley family . 
Through his shiny teeth , Lockhart said , 
- laugh up Harry ! 
The two of us combined on the page . 
Finally , when he dropped Harry's hand , he felt his fingers numb . 
He was trying to keep up with the Weasleys , and Lockhart put his arm over his shoulder and clamped it to his hips . 
He raised his hand for everyone to silence and said loudly : 
- Ladies and gentlemen , how extraordinary this moment ! This is a perfect moment for me to send you a small message that I have been waiting for . 
Today , when this young Harry walked into the bookstore and Jewelry , he just wanted to buy my autobiography - a book that I would happily sign for him now , free 
the crowd clapped their fence . 
Lockhart shook Harry's shoulders so hard that his glasses dropped to the tip of his nose . 
He continued : 
- He did not know that , soon enough , he would receive much , much more than my book , The Coloring Book . 
In fact , he and his schoolmates will come in contact with the mysterious flesh . 
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to announce that this September , I will take over the professorship of Black Hawk Arts at Hogwarts - the Academy of Witchcraft and Wizardry ! 
The crowd cheered and cheered , and Harry saw himself donating the entire work of Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Taking the pile of books , he was a little crooked , plying his way to a corner of the room outside the lights of the limelight . He came to Ginny's side , she was standing next to a new cauldron . 
Harry dropped Ginny's uncollected book , muttering to her : 
- Give me this stuff . 
I will buy your books later 
- Do you love that game , Potter ? 
Harry had no difficulty recognizing his voice . 
He stood up face - to - face with Draco Malfoy . 
The face of this guy is usually contemptuous smile . 
Malfoy said : 
- Harry Potter so brilliant that there is no bookstore alone can not not go to the front page of the newspaper ! 
Ginny says : 
- leave him alone . 
You do not want all that . 
This is the first time Ginny opened his mouth in front of Harry . 
She was scowling at Malfoy . 
This guy is long in his voice : 
- You got a kid for you , Potter ? 
Ginny shakes his head . 
Just as Ron and Hermione had reached their way , both of them were filled with Lockhart's book . 
Ron looked at Malfoy as if he was looking at something harsh on his soles : 
- That's you ! 
Are you surprised that Harry is here ? 
Malfoy argued : 
- Not surprised to see you in the bookstore where Weasley . 
I guess the three of you have to starve for a month to save enough money for that book . 
Ron was as red as Ginny . 
He also threw down the book of Ginny's cauldron , and then to Malfoy , but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket . 
- Ron ! 
Mr. Weasley called , he struggled with Fred and George . 
- What are you doing here ? 
This is too crowded , we go out ! 
- Arthur Weasley . 
Mr. Malfoy's father appeared , standing beside Malfoy , wrapping an arm around his shoulders , a disdainful smile on his face , just like his son . 
Mr. Weasley nodded his head coldly : 
- Hi Lucius . 
Mr Malfoy said : 
- Did I hear you were busy at work ? 
All those search phrases I hope they pay overtime ? 
He reached for Ginny's cauldron , picked up from a flash of Lockhart's flashy books , into a very old , almost cover - up book , which was the right to enter the Gap , and Malfoy continued . 
- Obviously they did not answer . 
Father bash , humiliating the reputation of the witch by paying smuggled salaries are not any benefit what ? 
Mr. Weasley's face was even redder than Ron and Ginny's . 
He said : 
" We think it is completely different from the Malfoys ' lost reputation . 
- Of course . 
Mr. Malfoy said , turning pale eyes toward Hermione's parents who were watching the story nervously : 
With those kind of aunts , Mr. Weasley , I see that your family has no lower place to settle down . 
For an hour , Ginny's cauldron flew to Malfoy ; Mr. Weasley also dived into Mr. Malfoy , punching him down a bookshelf . 
Dozens of spell books crashed down their heads ; Fred and George dashed : 
- He ' ll go Daddy ! 
Mrs. Weasley screamed : 
- do not ! 
Arthur , do not ! 
The crowd clambered up behind them , shoving down more bookshelves . 
So the book seller shouted : 
- Gentlemen , please 
But all shouting is like thunder : 
- Dissolution ! 
Dear , stop your hand 
Hagrid was hurrying through a bookshelf . 
In a blink of an eye , he pulled both Malfoy and Mr. Weasley apart . 
Mr. Weasley was crushed , and Malfoy was blinded by an encyclopaedia of poisonous mushrooms . 
He was still clutching Ginny's Ginny's book . 
He pressed the book into her , his eyes gleamed in a dazed manner : 
- Here , baby , hold your book ! That's the best thing your father can buy for you ! 
Out of Hagrid's hand , he waved to Draco and the two of them drove straight out of the bookstore . 
Hagrid nearly lifted Mr. Weasley to his feet as he adjusted the dress . 
He said , 
- Arthur , he should have worn his body . 
The whole family was rotten at the core , everyone knows it all . 
Bloodshed is their nature . 
No one in the family is worth worrying about . 
Well , come out of here ! 
The seller seemed to want to grasp Mr. Weasley's compensation , but realized he was only standing at the waist of Hagrid , so it seemed wise to think again , leaving the gang to go out . 
They rushed to the street , Mr. and Mrs. Granger trembled with fear , and Mrs. Weasley angered uncontrollably : 
- A good example for his children fighting openly do not know what Gilderoy Lockhart think 
Fred said , 
- Well done . 
Did not you hear him say something when he came out ? 
He asked the prodigy of the Daily Prophet whether the whole fight was reported in the article - he said it was also an advertisement . 
Still , people are quietly coming back to the bar stove , where Harry and the Weasleys and all the shopping , will return to Burrow's Floo . 
They say goodbye to the Granger family , who will leave the pub to take the Muggle Street , pick up the bus at the station across the street . 
Mr. Weasley asked them how the bus station worked , but stopped short of seeing Mrs. Weasley's gaze . 
Before taking a handful of Floo powder , Harry carefully removed the glasses and put them in his pocket . 
It is definitely not a pleasure to travel this way . 
Chapter 5 : ROYAL TREE 
But Harry was hoping for a quick start to school , but why the summer was so fast , Harry did not like it at all . 
Those days with the Weasley family were the happiest days of his life . 
When thinking of the Dursleys and how they would welcome it the next time it returned home on Privet Drive , it was not jealous of Ron . 
The last night Harry left Ron's house , Mrs. Weasley had prepared for a hearty dinner of all the things Harry loved , dessert with salty cakes . 
Fred and George finished the evening with a fireworks performance ; Make the kitchen overwhelmed with reddish blue stars , shot at the ceiling and flush the walls , for at least half an hour . 
Then everyone made a cup of hot chocolate last night before the kids went to bed . 
The next morning , it took a long time to depart . 
They wake up at the cock crow , but do not know how this story is not finished . 
Mrs. Weasley was in a state of panic , searching for socks and writing crocheted goose feathers ; People collide on the stairs , hands still holding half a piece of toast , the new shirt is half in half ; And Mr. Weasley nearly fell from his neck as he stumbled across a hen while he crossed the courtyard to take Ginny's chest in his car . 
Harry could not figure out how eight people , six chests , 
Harry could not figure out how eight people , six chests , two owls and a mouse were all in a small Ford Anglia car . 
He guessed , Mr. Weasley had added some special features to the car . 
- do not tell my dad . 
Mr. Weasley whispered to him , opened the trunk and showed Harry how he had been able to expand the compartment to allow all of the luggage to be easily accessible . 
Finally , when everyone was in the car , Mrs. Weasley glanced to the back seat , where Harry , Ron , George and Percy sat comfortably together , saying , 
- Muggle people have come to know that they do more than we think they are , right ? 
Grandmother and Ginny sit on the front bench , and the bench has been spotted as widely as benches in the park . 
She told Ginny : 
- Mama see , standing outside I did not expect inside so spacious like this ? 
Mr. Weasley opened the car and the car rolled out of the yard . 
Harry turned his head to look at the house for the last time . 
He had not thought of ever seeing the house again , so the car turned around , because George forgot the fireworks box spread at home . 
Then five minutes later , the car parked once more in the yard for Fred to run into the wand . 
And when they were about to leave for the highway , Ginny yelped that it had left the diary . When she climbed back into the car , the launcher was in the dew and everyone was impatient . 
Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and glanced at his wife . 
- Molly , honey or you 
- No , Arthur . 
- No one sees . 
This small button is the Invisibility boot that he has installed . 
It will take you soaring up Then I ' ll fly above the clouds . 
We will arrive at the station within ten minutes without anyone being able to be more intelligent 
- You said no , Arthur , can not open magic in the daytime . 
They came to the King's Cross station at eleven o ' clock . 
Mr. Weasley threw his handcuffs to the luggage and hurried to the station . 
Last year Harry had been on the Hogwarts Express . 
It was a bit of a hassle to get to Nine Three Fourth - the platform was completely invisible to the Muggle eyes . For the sorcerers , just go through the fence firmly , divided between platform 9 with platform number 10 . 
It is not painful , but it must be done carefully so that no Muggle finds himself suddenly disappearing . 
Mrs. Weasley looked anxiously at the clock above her head , indicating that the entire group had only five minutes to disappear randomly through the fence . 
She said : 
- You go ahead to Percy ! 
Percy quickly strode forward and disappeared . 
Mr. Weasley followed immediately ; Fred and George are the next . 
Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron : 
- Ginny's mother came first , then two children immediately follow ! 
She clutched Ginny's hand away . 
In the blink of an eye everyone was gone . 
Ron said to Harry : 
- We only have one minute left , two children in one go . 
Harry checked to make sure Hedwig's cage was tied firmly on the lid of the chest , and then pushed the car toward the fence . 
He felt completely confident ; This way is not as uncomfortable as using Floo powder . 
Both curved back on the trolley hand and aiming at the middle of the fence , preparing to speed up . 
The barrier was about a meter , the two rushed and ran 
LEFT ! ! ! ! 
Ron's chest dangled to the ground , and Harry rolled over . 
Both of their carts hit the fence and bounced back ; Ron's chest dangled to the ground , and Harry rolled over . 
The Hedwig cage hatched up on the clean floor of the station , and Hedwig spun around in the cage and shouted . 
Everyone stood around , a guard standing nearby shouted : 
- Where are the eyes of the nose ? 
Harry held his ribs up , panted , 
- We lost our car . 
Ron rushed to retrieve the Hedwig cage , the owl impressing so specially that the people around him began to murmur about the abuse of animals . 
Harry squealed , 
- Why can not we pass ? 
- I do not know 
Ron looked angry around . 
Dozens of curious people are still standing at it . 
Said Ron , 
- We missed the train . 
I do not know why the gate is so naturally closed . 
Harry looked up at the big clock with a feeling of tightness in his stomach . 
Ten seconds nine seconds 
He carefully pushed the car forward until the car came close to the fence , and then pushed it as hard as possible . 
The iron barrier is still inert . 
Ron said , 
- It's running . 
The train is gone . 
What if my parents did not come up with us ? 
Do you have any Muggle coins ? 
Harry chuckled : 
" The Dursleys have not paid me a penny for six years . 
Ron pressed his ear against the cold fence . 
He said anxiously : 
- He heard nothing . 
What are we going to do ? 
I do not know until the new parents come back to pick us up . 
Look around . 
People are still looking at it , mainly because Hedwig is constantly singing . 
Harry said : 
- I find it best to hang out in the car . This is just a place to raise attention 
Suddenly a flash of light in Ron's eyes : 
- Harry ! 
A car ! 
- So what ? 
- We can drive a car to Hogwarts ! 
- But I thought 
- We're too stuck , are not we ? 
And we have to go to school , right ? 
And even adolescent wizards are allowed to use magic in the event of a real emergency , as indicated in the nineteenth or thirteenth edition of the Rule of the Monkey . 
Harry's sense of fear turned into a thrill : 
- But you can fly it ? 
- No big deal . Said Ron , turning the trolley toward the door . 
- Well , let's go . 
If you are in a hurry , catch up on the Hogwarts Express . 
They marched past the curious Muggle crowd , out of the station and back to the side of the road where the old Ford Anglia car was parked . 
Ron unlocked the wagon's barrel by knocking the wand's head up in succession . 
The two ladies returned to the van , putting Hedwig in the back seat , and they were up in the front seat . 
Ron said : 
- Looking to see who is looking at me ? 
He blasted his car by knocking another wand . 
Harry poked his head through the window : traffic was running low on the main road ahead , but the parking lot was deserted . 
It says : 
- Okay . 
Ron pressed the tiny silver button on the dashboard . 
The two cars suddenly disappeared - and they always followed . 
Harry could still feel the chair vibrating beneath him , hearing the car engine explode , still feeling his hands on his knees , and his glasses on his nose , but it seemed to be his whole body . There were two eyeballs , two feet away from the ground , above an ugly road filled with cars . 
Ron's right : 
- Let's go ! 
So the ground and dusty buildings on either side of Harry were falling off , lost in sight as the car hit high ; only in sight when the car hits high ; In a matter of seconds , both the splendid and opulent London city lay underneath the two . 
Then there was a bang , and the car with Harry and Ron reappeared . 
- Hey , it's broken 
Ron threw himself in . Invisible boot , exclaimed . 
Two punches hit the machine . 
The car disappeared . 
Then again . 
Shouted Ron . 
- Hold tight ! 
He stomped on the accelerator ; The car sped up into a cloud of spongy and low clouds , and everything became cloudless . 
Harry blinked at the thick cloud that was clutching it in every direction . 
She asked : 
- So what ? 
Ron replied : 
- We need to find the Hogwarts Express to find out which direction to fly . 
- Down to Mau 
The car fell off the clouds , the two of them turned around in the seat , rolling their eyes toward the ground looking . 
Harry reo : 
- I see it ! 
Û û ngay ! 
Below , the Hogwarts Express trains make a long stripe , like a purple serpent . 
Examining the compass on the dashboard , Ron said : 
- in the north . All right , we just need to check every half hour , or that size . 
Hold tight 
And they jumped on the clouds . 
A minute later , they protrude into the bright light . 
A different world . 
Wheels fly as the sea on the clouds floating , bright sky , deep blue under the sun dazzling . 
Said Ron : 
So the ground and dusty buildings on either side of Harry fell off , 
- Now we only have to meet some aircraft . 
They looked at each other and laughed ; Laugh for a long time , can not stop . 
It seems they have plunged into a mythical dream . 
Harry thought this was the only way to travel - flying through the clouds , snow clouds . 
In a car full of warm sunshine , there is a delicious candy bag available in the glove box . At best was the sight of Fred and George's jealous faces as they landed softly and spectacularly on the smooth grass before Hogwarts . 
Two children regularly check the route in the direction of the Hogwarts Express train runs farther and farther north . 
Each time they dive under the clouds , they see another scene appearing below . 
The city of London has been left behind so far . 
Rather than the streets , the blue fields were neatly arranged , and then the vast , lush green fields , and then there came a lively , large city with cars running like colorful ants . Come to the village with tiny churches . 
However , after a few hours without any further incidents , Harry had to admit that their joy was slightly worn out . 
Candies just make them terribly thirsty , and they have nothing to drink . 
Harry and Ron started to take off their warm clothes , but Harry's T - shirt stuck to the back of his chair , and his glasses slipped down his shaggy nose . 
Now he stopped looking at the interesting shape of the clouds , and began to think of the speeding train running under the wish . 
Under that one can buy a pumpkin juice from a witch driving a car for sale in the carriages . 
Why can not they be at Nine Three Fours ? 
Several more hours passed , and Ron's voice went up : 
- Where are you so far away ? 
The sun began to dive down the rug , spreading on the crimson . 
Ron asked Harry : 
- Prepare to take a look at the train ? 
The ship was still just below them , running through a snow - covered mountain . 
Under the cloud , the sky looks better than the sky above . 
Ron throttle pedal , for the car up and up , but just hit the gas , the car started moaning . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other anxiously . 
Said Ron : 
- Maybe it's tired . 
Until now , it has not gone so far 
And both acted as if they did not hear the car's groan grow louder , while the sky grew darker . 
Stars begin to blink in the dark black sky . 
Harry put on a warm coat again , trying not to notice the glaze on the windshield , fluttering weakly as if to protest . 
Said Ron , seemingly to the car than to Harry : 
- Not far away . 
Coming up . 
Then he patted on the dashboard . 
A moment later , as they dived down through the clouds again , they turned their eyes to see through the darkness and turned horizontally to find a familiar scene under the ground . 
Harry screamed as Ron and Hedwig jerked themselves : 
- Behold ! 
Right in front of it ! 
Shadow on the horizon , and rise above the lake's cliffs , watch towers and halls of Hogwarts Castle are standing . 
But the car is coming out now , it's slowing down . 
Ron patted the rudder , speaking in a flirtatious voice : 
- Come on . 
Almost there , try 
Machine car moaning . 
The steam coming out from under the hood . 
Harry had to squeeze the two sides of the chair as they flew toward the lake . 
The car is now irritating . 
Glancing out the window , Harry saw the water's surface as flat as a mirror and black , probably about a mile below . 
Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel of the car . 
The car wobbled again . 
Ron murmured : 
- Come on ! 
They are flying on the lake . 
The castle is right in front . 
Ron pulled his foot back . 
There was a creaking sound , then the sound of hissing , finally the machine was completely dumbfounded . 
Shouted Ron in the silence : 
- Okay . 
The nose dropped , they fell , faster and faster , plugging their heads into the solid stone walls of Hogwarts Castle . 
- DESTINATION ! 
! 
! ! 
! ! 
Ron screamed , twisting the steering wheel all the way ; The car dodged the wall narrowly , heading for the huge arched porch , soaring above the greenhouse to plant the dark tree , then to the vegetable garden , and then the black grass as ebony , but not so . fly higher . 
Ron let go of the steering wheel and pulled his wand out of his pocket : 
- STOP ! stop ! 
It screamed , threw the wand down on the dashboard and the windshield , but the car slammed down like a lead . 
The ground is flying backwards , piercing towards them 
- WHAT HAPPEN ! 
Harry leaned over the steering wheel and screamed . 
But it was too late 
The car crashed into a tree , causing a terrible noise of the metal 
SPEED ! ! ! ! 
The car slammed into a tree trunk , causing a horrible noise of metal and wood to collide fiercely , then crashed into the ground like a punch hit the board . 
The vapor rises from the crumpled roof of the car ; Hedwig hissed in horror ; Harry's head hit the windshield , u hit a big ball with a golf ball ; And to the right of it , Ron uttered a small moan . 
Harry asked angry Ron : 
- Do not you ? 
Ron said in a trembling voice . 
- Your wand looks at your wand 
The chopstick broke off , almost in two pieces ; The chopsticks are weak , just sticking to the chopsticks . 
Harry opened his mouth to say that he was sure Ron would repair Ron's wand at school , but he did not have the chance to say anything : at that moment , something hit the car with power . The strength of a bull is attacking , kicking it down Ron , then another hit on the hood , with the same power . 
- What's going on ? 
Ron glanced glazed over the windshield , and Harry looked around , just in time to see a big fat tree like a python lurking behind them . 
The tree that had been misplaced was curled down : its trunk was almost twice its length and its bumpy branches were feeding dust around the car , anywhere they could reach . 
- ASIAN ! 
Ron cried out as a large , twisted branch of a doorknob filled a large chunk of the car door ; The windshield is now shaking with the fierce punches of the boughs , and a large branch of the tree is used to destroy the fortress in an angry fashion on the shrinking roof . . 
Ron shouted : 
- Run away ! 
He put his best effort into the door , but ; Immediately hit by another branch spleen to the opposite , fell on Harry's thigh . 
Ron groaned as the hood sank . 
- That's it ! 
Suddenly the floor vibrates - the engine suddenly starts to reboot . 
Harry yelled : 
- Defeat ! 
The car spins backwards ; The devil still tries to fight against them ; can hear the creaking roots as if they were about to spit on themselves , chasing when the car jumped out of the reach of the tree . 
Ron panted : 
- Okay then . 
Very good , car . 
However , the car has already suffered . 
Two squeaky chimes , the door burst open and Harry felt his chair flip over : the next was that he found himself lying on the wet ground in mango . 
The croaking shudders told him that the car was also carrying their luggage out of the trunk . 
Hedwig's cage fluttered in midair and opened ; Hedwig flew out of the cage , squealing with anger and flying toward the castle without throwing it back to a look . 
The car , chipping , scratching , and anger evaporated , running into the darkness , the back lamp flashed indignantly . 
Ron screamed behind the car , waving his wand off : 
- Come back ! 
Will not shave my head ! 
But the car disappeared with a snort from the smoke exhaust . 
Ron bent down to pick up the Scabbers and said , 
- Do you believe in our luck ? 
In all the trees we could have mistaken , we were right back in the tree that retaliated . 
Ron glanced over his shoulder at the old devil - tree , still beating the frightening branches . 
Harry tiredly said : 
- Stop it ! We go back to school 
It was not a glorious school trip that they envisioned . 
Stiff , frozen , and scratched , they grabbed the chest of drawers and dragged on the steep grass toward the great oak gate . 
- I'm sure the party has started already . 
Ron dropped his chest down the hallway steps , quietly crossing the hallway to look at the lighted window . 
- Hey , Harry ! 
Come here , there is a ceremony . 
Harry hurried forward , with Ron poking his head into the Hall . 
Countless candles hovering in the air above the four long tables make the gold plates and cups shine . 
On high , the ceiling has been spell so always have to show the sky outside sparkling thousands of stars . 
Between the hollow black Hogwarts cone , Harry saw the first - year freshmen . 
They were standing in the hall in terror . 
Ginny is also in the group , easily recognizable by the red hair of the house 
Weasley . 
At that moment , Professor McGonagall - the witch who wore sunglasses with high buns , put the famous Hogwarts hats on the chair in front of the new soldiers . 
Every year , the old , rugged , patchy and dirty hat made the job of classifying new students into four halls of Hogwarts ( Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin ) . 
Harry remembered when he put the hat on his head , just a year ago , it was dumbfounded waiting for the decision to get the hat grumble loudly in his ear . 
In that scary second , Harry feared that the hat would place him in the Slytherin house - the trainer of more sorcerers darker than all the others - but eventually he entered Gryffindor's house , along with Ron , Hermione , and all the other brothers in the Weasley family . 
By the school year , Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the Home Championship , beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years . 
A tiny boy with gray hair called up , stepped forward to put the hat on his head . 
Harry eyed him from the boy to the principal , Professor Dumbledore , sitting at the teacher's desk looking at the student classification . 
The long silver beard and Dumbledore's half moon glasses shone with candles . 
Harry also saw Gilderoy Lockhart dressed in a blue blouse sitting Dumbledore chairs . 
And at the bottom of the table was old Hagrid , the tall and dull - haired general , his bearded mustache . 
Harry whispered to Ron : 
- to see Teacher's empty space where a teacher Snape ? 
Professor Snape is the teacher Harry is least loved . 
By the way , Harry is the one that Snape most dislikes compared to all his students . 
Mr. Snape was brutally cruel , arrogant and cynical , so out of the Slytherin students by the master , nor any student who likes him . 
He teaches poison medicine . 
Unable to see Snape face at the teacher's desk , Ron was full of hope , saying : 
- He's sick ! 
Harry said : 
- He's about to leave . 
Because he returned to the professorship Against the Dark Arts again . 
Ron exclaimed , 
- Or he was fired ! 
I see , no one likes him 
A cold voice said behind them : 
- Or maybe he is waiting to hear why they are not coming to school by train . 
Harry swung around . 
Behold , Snape was standing there , his black robes shaking in the cold wind . 
He is a thin man , gray skin , curly nose , and 
The hair is long at the shoulders . 
At this point , he was smiling , a smile signaling to Ron and Harry that disaster was coming down their heads . 
Snape said , 
- follow me ! 
Harry and Ron did not even dare to look at each other , only rushing to follow Snape into the large , echoed hall , lit by torches . 
The smell of scented food came from the Hall . 
But Snape did not put them in that bright spot , leading them down a narrow stone staircase that led down to the basements . 
He opened a door in the middle of the cold corridor and pointed at : 
- That's it ! 
The two entered Snape's office , shivering . 
The murky walls in the room were filled with huge glass jars , which contained everything that could make a cock , but Harry was not interested in knowing their names at the moment . 
The fireplace was empty and cold . 
Snape closed the room and turned to look at the two children . 
He said softly : 
So the iron boat is not worthy of the Harry Potter and the faithful friend of the Weasley faithful to go to school ? 
So this iron boat is not worthy of Harry Potter and our faithful Weasley partner to go to school ? 
Want to go to school in a shocking way , the boys ? 
- Teacher , just at the fence at King's Cross Station , it 
Master Snape coldly : 
- Im ! 
What did they do with the car ? 
Ron swallowed . This is not the first time Mr. Snape has given Harry the impression that he can read the minds of people . 
But just a little while , when he opened the Prophet's Afternoon , today's number , was Harry's instant break . 
Let them read the headline on the front page : FORG ANGLIA BAY CARRYING TO MUGGLE MEMORANDUM , he whispered through his teeth : 
- We've been seen . 
I read aloud : 
Two London - based Muggles said they saw the car flying through the post office tower . 
At noon in Norfolk , Mrs Hetty Bayliss , while wearing Mr Angus Fleet's clothes , in Peebles , reported the police total of about six or seven Muggles . 
I think your father at work in the US Department of MUGLE ? 
He looked at Ron and smiled a more horrible smile than he had before . 
- Wow , that's his son 
Harry felt as if the huge branches of the mad tree were thrust into his stomach . 
If anyone finds out that Mr. Weasley is a wealthy guy , why is not he thinking about it ? 
Snape continued : 
- When we look at the park , we find that the Willow Roi is very valuable and has been significantly damaged . 
Ron blurted out , 
- That tree makes us more hurt than we are 
- Im ! 
- Master Snape reckless . Unfortunately , the games are not students , so we decided not to play them . 
I will find someone who has the right to exercise that interesting power . 
The game is waiting here . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other , their faces white . 
Now Harry is hungry . 
At this point he felt extremely miserable , trying not to look at something big and flat , hovering in the green liquid on Snape's desk . 
If Snape was going to look for Professor McGonagall , Gryffindor's boss , their fate would not have been better . 
McGonagall was probably more fair than Snape , but she was also extremely strict . 
Ten minutes later , Snape returned , and of course McGonagall was with him . 
Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry several times , but either he could not remember having had her mouth tightened , or had never seen her so angry . As she entered the room she raised her wand ; Harry and Ron both cringed , but she just pointed her chopsticks to the cold fireplace and immediately flames . 
She said : 
- Sit down . 
The two boys sat down on the bench by the fireplace . 
Professor McGonagall's glasses flashed ominously . 
She said : 
- Explain . 
Ron told the story , starting at the fence at the Crossroads Station . The King refused to give them into the nine - quarter station . 
- Professor , we have no choice , we can not get on board . 
Professor McGonagall looked coldly at Harry : 
- Why do not you send me a note ? 
You know I have an owl ? 
Harry looked at Professor McGonagall . 
Now that she says it , then it is obvious that it must be done in the first place . 
- I do not think 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- So it's clear . 
There was a knock on Mr. Snape's office door . 
Now he looks happy , he opens the door . At the doorstep was the principal , Professor Dumbledore . 
Harry's body was numb . 
Dumbledore's face looked unusually serious . 
He bent his nose to look at the kids , and Harry suddenly felt like him and Ron was still being rushed by Willow Flies . 
Silent for a long moment . 
Then Dumbledore said : 
- Explain why you do that ? 
If he was shouting , maybe Harry would feel better . 
She could not bear the disappointment in her voice . 
For some reason , he could not look at Dumbledore , but leaned back , as if to say to his knee . 
She told Dumbledore everything , except that Mr. Weasley was able to maneuver the car , making the listener think like himself and Ron randomly made a car parked outside the station . 
He knew Dumbledore would see this trick , but he did not ask any more questions about the car . 
When Harry finished talking , he continued to stare at the two children through his half - moon glasses . 
Ron said with a voice without any hope : 
- We would like to collect the furniture . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- What did you say , Weasley ? 
- Yes , not the teachers chasing us ? 
Harry looked at Dumbledore . 
He said : 
- Not today , Mr. Weasley . 
But we have to emphasize both the seriousness of what they did . 
Tonight I will write a letter to my two children . I must also warn you that if you do this again , there is no other way than to expel the game . 
Snape's face faded as if he was about to go to a Christmas party when the party was canceled . 
He cleared his throat : 
- Professor Dumbledore , these children have disregarded the Juvenile Minority Limitation Act , causing serious harm to a precious tree . 
Definitely action of this kind 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
" It was Professor McGonagall who made the decision to punish these two children , Mr. Snape . 
They are the students she is responsible for and therefore the responsibility belongs to her . 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
- I have to go back to the party , Miss McGonagall , I have to announce a few notes . Come on , Snape , there's a cake that looks good , I want to taste it 
Snape hurled Harry and Ron into a very insidious look and followed Dumbledore out of the office , leaving her Professor McGonagall alone . 
Professor McGonagall is still staring at his pupils as a raging eagle . 
- It is best to go to hospital , Weasley , bleeding . 
Ron hurriedly put his sleeve on his bloody lips , saying in a hurry : 
- It's okay . 
Miss , I want to go see her children are classified 
The professor said : 
- Ceremony is finished . 
My baby is also home to Gryffindor . 
Ron shouted : 
- Oh , great ! 
Professor McGonagall said , 
- About the Gryffindor house 
But Harry said , 
- Dear ladies , when we drive the car , the school year has not started , so - so can not except Gryffindor points about it , right ? 
Having said that , he was anxious to see Professor McGonagall wait . 
The professor glared at Harry with a fierce look , but he believed her lips were clenched to hold a smile . 
Anyway , her lip when pressed is not so tight . 
She said : 
- You will not deduct Gryffindor points . 
Harry's heart was light . 
- But both of you will be subject to a fine . 
That is far better than what they feared . 
As for Dumbledore writing a letter to Mrs Dursley , Harry was not distracted . 
She is sure that her aunt will only regret that Willow Roi does not grind it down for good . 
The professor waved his wand at Snape's desk . 
Immediately appeared a plate of nests of meat sandwiches , two silver cups , a jar of chilled pumpkin juice . 
She said : 
- You eat here and go straight to the bedroom . 
The door to the room behind Professor McGonagall's back was Ron whistling . 
He grabbed the burgers : 
- I'm sure I passed the trunk . 
Harry also took a bite that grabbed . 
- I think so too . 
filled with a mouthful of minced meat with chicken , Ron asked awkwardly : 
- Can you believe the number of our bugs ? 
Fred and George have been driving the car for at least five or six times , which Muggle did they see ? 
He paused to swallow and take a big bite . 
- Why do not we get through that fence ? 
Harry shrugged . 
- Anyway , from now on we should be careful too . 
It was filled with a large sip of pumpkin juice , craved : 
- I wish we were in the party 
Ron seemed to know : 
- She did not want us to face her face . It does not make sense to go to school with a flying car . 
When they filled up the sandwiches ( the fork was filling up when they had left the bread ) , they stood up , following the familiar passage back to the Gryffindor Tower . 
Quiet castle ; It seems the party is over . 
They walked through murmuring portraits and clowns of iron armor , then climbed up staggered stone stairs , finally reaching the corridor where the secret door to enter the dormitory . Gryffindor . 
The door was hidden behind a portrait of a fat lady wearing a pink silk dress . 
As they approached , Mrs. Beo asked : 
- Password ? 
Harry : 
- E 
They do not know the password of the new school year , because they have not met Gryffindor's leader . 
But at that moment the savior appears . 
They both heard footsteps rush back , and turned and saw Hermione running toward them . 
- You guys are here ! 
Where are you two now ? 
The rumor is very humorous - someone said you two were fired because the car was flying . 
Harry reassures her : 
- No , we have not been fired . 
Hermione's voice was heard , solemnly , without losing the voice of Professor McGonagall : 
- You two dare tell me you two fly here ? 
Ron impatiently : 
- For the message , tell us the new password . 
Angry Hermione : 
- Is turkey , but that is not 
But she had not finished the sentence , the portrays Mrs. Boo flipped aside to reveal the entrance to the common room . 
A sudden applause rang out . 
It seemed as though all of the Gryffindors were still awake and standing in the living room , on soft couches and worn - out tables , waiting for the two of them . 
The arms reached through the portraits Mrs. Beo lifted Harry and Ron inside , leaving Hermione crawling through the hole and joining them . 
Lee Jordan screamed : 
- Excellent ! impressive ! 
A great entry ! 
Drive the car to fly directly to the tree Lieu Roi , then here are people will talk about this in many years . 
A fifth - year student who had not had a chance to talk to him , Harry said , 
- Well done ! 
It sounded like it had just hit the ground first in the road race . 
Fred and George pushed the two of them in front of the crowd and said , 
- Hey , why do not you guys call us to come back ? 
Ron blushed , grinning , but Harry noticed a look of discomfort , that Chief Percy jerked his head through the eager first - year students , as if he were Try to come near to tell them to disband . 
Harry hurried to Ron's side and nodded at Percy . 
Ron immediately understood . 
Percy said : 
- go to the bedroom to the children - quite tired . 
Harry and Ron immediately broke the path toward the other end of the room , where the door opened the twisted stairs to the bedrooms . 
Before going , Harry called Hermione , who was wearing a frown as Percy . 
- Good night ! 
They had to go to the other end of the common room , still being patted on their shoulders . 
Finally , climb the stairs and they will be calm . 
The two men climbed up , and caught up directly above the door leading into their old bedroom , a billboard recording SECOND YEAR . 
They walked into a familiar , five - room window with a narrow , high - hanging window hanging red velvet . 
Their baggage was taken to the room and placed at the foot of the bed . 
Ron grinned at Harry with guilt : 
- I know I should not like it or generally say something like that , but 
The door to the bedroom suddenly opened , and the Gryffindor boys rushed in : Seamus Finnigan , Dean Thomas , and Neville Longbottom . 
Seamus smiles : 
- Can not believe it's true though ! 
- Or ! 
Dean just said simple . 
And Neville was horrified : 
- Terrible ! 
Harry could not stop , grinned . 
Chapter 6 : GILDEROY LOCKHART 
But the next day , Harry could not smile once . 
From breakfast in the hall onwards , everything goes downhill without brakes . 
The porridge , the salmon plates , the mountain toast , the forks and salted meat are laid on four long tables of four dormitories under the enchanted ceiling ( today it has one color dark gray cloud ) . 
Harry and Ron sit down at Gryffindor's hut , next to Hermione . 
She opened the voyage with the vampire , leaning against her breast . 
In Hermione's morning voice there was a bit of a hardness that Harry understood that she still did not approve of the way Ron and Ron went to school the day before . ( Dare to drive a flying car into a tree ! ) . 
On the contrary , Neville Longbottom greeted them cheerfully . 
Neville is a boy with a round face , or less likely to get hit and feel than anyone he has ever met . 
Neville said : 
- The letter is coming . 
I'm looking forward to sending my grandmother things that I have forgotten . 
Looks that right : Harry has just started to eat porridge , hundreds of flies flying wildly on the children . 
Flicked around the hall , dropping letters and postcards down the swaggering children . 
A huge bundle fell on Neville's head , and a second later , a large gray object fell on Hermione's milk , splashing on the children's milk and feathers . 
- Errol ! 
Shouted Ron . 
He grasped the tusk's leg torn up . 
Errol rolled to the table , unconscious , to the sky , holding a red envelope . 
Ron gasped . 
- Oh , no way 
Hermione gave Errol a soft thumb and said , 
- It's alright , it's still alive . 
- It's not that - but that ! 
Ron was pointing at the red envelope . 
Harry looked normal , but both Ron and Neville looked at the envelope as if it were about to explode . 
Harry asked : 
- What's up ? 
Ron whispered weakly : 
- Cheek sent me a letter Thunder . 
Neville whispered in awe : 
- Well , open it up , Ron . 
If not open , it is even worse . 
Once my grandmother sent me a letter , it's her body and it's terrible ! 
Harry looked at Ron and Neville's surprised faces and looked at the red envelope . 
She asked : 
- What is the Thunder Letter ? 
But Ron's mind had set off the letter , and in one corner the envelope began to smolder . 
Neville pleaded : 
- Open up . 
A few minutes will pass 
Ron reached out his trembling hand , took the letter in Errol's beak , and opened the letter . 
Neville put his fingers in his ear . 
After a moment , Harry knew the reason . 
At first , Harry thought of the explosion : a chain of rumbling sounds all over the hall , shaking the ceiling , flying dust : 
- HAVE A CAR , IF A CHILD HAS BEEN HAPPENED WHEN THE SCHOOL IS NEVER IMMEDIATELY , THE CHILD HAS ALREADY TAKEN WHEN THE CHILD HAS ALREADY CLOSED THAT THERE WAS THINKING THROUGH THREE AGRICULTURAL WIFES WHEN DOES THE MACHINE LOSE ? 
Mrs. Weasley's voice , which was hundreds of times bigger than usual , made the spoon on the table lacerate , and the stone wall echoed deafeningly . 
Everyone in the room turned around to find out who was the Thunder . 
Ron thumped himself low in the chair so that only his reddish forehead was visible . 
- THE DUMBLEDORE's WITNESS WRESTLER THROWS THAT ANY THOUGHTS THAT MAY DEATH HAVE BEEN HAPPENED , THREE THOUGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKING HAPPY HOLIDAYS , HAVE YOU HAPPY AND HARRY CAN DIE 
Harry was puzzled when he heard his name . 
He tried so hard to make it seem as if he did not hear the sound of his ear piercing . 
- GIVE YOUR HEALTH THAT THINK THAT THEY ARE UNDERGROUNDED AT THE DEPARTMENT , WHICH IS REALLY WRONG AND RON AND WHAT THEY CAN TELL A LONG TERM STRENGTH BECAUSE THE RISK IS SUSPECTED BY THE FAMILY . 
An absolute silence . 
The red envelope fell from Ron's hand , flaring itself up and bent into a piece of ashes . 
Harry and Ron sat face - to - face , as if a wave of waves had passed over them . 
Some people burst out laughing , and then slowly , the tussle rolled back and forth as usual in the hall . 
Hermione straddled the Journey with Vampire again , peering down at Ron's top . 
- Really , I do not know what you want , but you 
is it worth living ? 
Needless to say . 
Ron crow . 
Harry pushed his porridge away . 
Abdomen , it is full of guilt . 
Mr. Weasley is being questioned at work . Is it the way she responded to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley about all they had done for him this past summer ? 
But it does not have time to torment ; Professor McGonagall is attending the Gryffindor table to give the new school year . 
Harry received his schedule and found that the first two classes with the Hufflepuff students were Herbal Medicine . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione went out together from the castle , across the vegetable garden , to the glass house where the mysterious trees were planted . 
The Thunder's doing so well : Hermione seems to think that the two of them are punished as such , so they are as friendly as ever . 
As they approached the glasshouse , the whole class was standing outside waiting for Professor Sprout . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione entered the crowd , and across the lawn , Sprout was striding , with Lockhart escorting . 
Professor Sprout's arm was covered with bandages , and Harry saw the Willow Roi standing far away over the branches now , feeling guilty for hurting Harry . 
Mr. Lockhart was very groomed in his turquoise turtleneck shirt 
Professor Sprout is a small and short sorceress , wearing a patch of hats on her hair ; Her clothes and fingernails are always full of soil , and Aunt Petunia , who had seen it , must have fainted . 
However , Lockhart was very groomed in his turquoise turtleneck shirt . 
Under the hat , also turquoise gold color , the team neatly perfect , his blond hair is also shiny . 
Smiling at the gathering of students , Gilderoy Lockhart said aloud : 
- Hello children ! 
He just instructed the professor how to take care of the old trees Lieu Roi right ! 
But I do not want you to think that you are better at herbal medicine than her ! 
It was by accident that he encountered many kinds of unique plants in his travels . 
Professor Sprout looked baffled , unlike her usual playful nature . 
She said : 
- The game , today the glasshouse three . 
There is a buzz of excitement . 
Previously , the children had only been taught in the first greenhouse - the third greenhouse had more dangerous and interesting plants . 
Professor Sprout took a large key still in his belt to open the door . 
Harry inhaled a breath of damp air , the fertilizer mixed with the aromatic odor of the giant flowers , some of which were covered with umbrellas , dangling under the ceiling . He was about to follow Ron and Hermione when Lockhart's hand snuggled . 
- Harry ! 
You have a few words to tell Professor Sprout , late Harry a few minutes the professor does not bother ? 
Sprout's frown , she knew , was annoying , but Lockhart slammed the glass door right in front of her and said , 
- okay then ! 
Mr. Lockhart turned to Harry , his white teeth shining with the sun as he shook his head : 
- Harry ! 
Oh , Harry ! Harry ! Harry ! 
Harry did not know what to do , so he did not say anything . 
- When I hear it , of course , that's my fault . 
He slammed his back . 
Harry did not understand what Lockhart was saying . 
He told Lockhart so he said : 
- I wonder what's more amazing to me : drive a car to Hogwarts ! 
Well , of course I know right away why you do it . 
Play floating . 
Harry , Harry , Harry ! 
The way you see all white teeth , even when not talking , is remarkable . 
Teacher continued : 
- Did I rehearse for the smell of fame ? has sown in the mind of that consolation . 
The game was posted on the press page with me , and you can not wait next time ? 
- No , teacher 
- Harry , Harry , Harry ! 
I understand it all . 
Lockhart grabbed Harry's shoulder : 
- Naturally , once you smell it , naturally , you crave another piece of it . 
I'm just blaming myself for the smell of the game , because it's so headless . But , young man , do not think about driving a car that can make famous games . 
Just be calm ! 
Bored with the time for these things when the game grows up . 
Well , I know what you're thinking ! With teacher , he was a famous witch in the world ! But when I was twelve years old , I was just an unnamed good guy ! 
Actually , I can say I'm not really anonymous . 
I say that game is also a little known , right ? Something in the middle of the game with the Caller - not - called - out ! 
He glanced at Harry's forehead . 
- I know , I know It was not as good as I was awarded the most charming smile of the Wizard of the Witches for five years . But it was a game that started out , Harry , and that . 
Harry gave Harry a wink and walked away . 
Harry stood there for a moment , then remembered that he should have been in herbal medicine class , which pushed the greenhouse door in . 
Professor Sprout was standing behind a long tape on a rack in the middle of the greenhouse . 
On about two dozen pairs of colored caps . 
As Harry stood in his place between Ron and Hermione , Professor Sprout said , 
- Today we will repot for ginseng . 
Who can tell her the properties of Ginseng ? 
No one was surprised to see Hermione's hand rising faster than all else . 
- Ginseng , also known as Mandragora , is a powerful herbal revitalizing effect . 
Hermione reads as if she has swallowed the textbook in her stomach . 
- This drug is used to restore people who are deformed or cursed , to help them return to the original state . 
Professor Sprout said : 
- Excellent . 
Ten points for Gryffindor . 
Ginseng is an essential part of most antidotes . 
However , it is also dangerous . 
Who can explain why ? 
Hermione's hand was high in Harry's eyes , dropping his glasses . 
She answered immediately : 
- Because ginseng can kill those who listen . 
- Correct . 
Give ten more points . 
Now look here , the ginseng we have here is still young . 
The professor points to a deep pot of water and everyone picks up to see clearly . 
Hundreds or so , bunches of seedlings grow in rows of pots , leaves are reddish green . 
Harry did not find anything remarkable , and he had no idea what Hermione called Ginseng's cry . 
Professor Sprout said : 
- Each person receives a pair of headgear caps . 
Children do not scramble to get a pair of pink hat or ruffled hat . 
- When you tell the children to bring in , you have to close your ears . 
When she can take off , she will raise her thumb . 
Be prepared to wear a hat ! 
Harry took the hat and covered it with his ears , and suddenly the sound disappeared . 
Professor Sprout wears a fluffy pink headdress , rolled up her sleeves , her hands clutching a bush that pulls up . 
Harry uttered a squeak , but no one seemed to hear it . 
Instead of being rooted out of the ground , it's a tiny , extremely ugly baby , full of soil . 
The leaves grow on top of their heads instead of their hair . 
He had a pale , mottled complexion , and it was obvious that his lungs were panting , indicating that he was crying . 
Professor Sprout took from under the table a large pot to stuff the ginseng plant , burying the plants in the wet damp fertilizer until only a few leaves of it . 
Professor Sprout rubbed the dust on his hands , raised his thumb , and took off his hat . 
- Because the ginseng is only a seedlings , their cries are not deadly . 
The professor said calmly as if she had just done the watering of the sea lantern . 
- But they also make many children unconscious hours . 
And because she was sure that all of us would have survived after this first class , she advised them to wear a headgear for practice . 
When the lesson ends , she will take note of the children . 
Now each group of four practice with a tray . 
There are a lot of pots here . There's a fertilizer in some sacks over there . Remember that some tentacles are poisonous , they're teething ! 
As he spoke , the professor suddenly slapped a dark red tree , causing it to shrink a few long tentacles dared to sneak up on her shoulder . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione and a curly - headed Hufflepuff make up a group . 
Harry often sees this boy but has not had the opportunity to talk . 
As Harry shook hands , the boy said cheerfully : 
- I'm Justin Finch - Fletchley . 
Of course , you are the famous Harry Potter And you are Hermione Granger - who always leads the course . 
Hermione was shaking hands with Justin , listening to that too . 
- And you , Ron Weasley . 
Is that your car ? 
Ron could not smile . 
The Thunder letter obviously still haunts it . 
- Super lockhart too ? 
Justin happily chatted as they both fertilized the dragonless plants . 
- Laryngeal haemorrhoids . 
Do you read his books ? 
If I were a werewolf crouched in a public telephone , I would have died in fear , so calm but still calm ! ! ! It is extraordinary . 
You know , my name is on Eton's recruiting list , but I'm happy to know when to go to school here . 
Of course my mother was a little disappointed , but from the time I gave Lockhart's book to her , she saw that her cheeks began to understand that having a trained witch in the house would be helpful later . 
After these ramshackles , the four did not have much chance to speak any more . 
All of them have to wear ear caps and pay attention to the ginseng . 
Professor Sprout made the job seem easy , but it was not easy . 
Ginseng roots do not get out of the ground , but when out and then not back . 
They kicked , twisted , kicked , punched , clenched teeth . 
Harry took ten minutes to try to put a special ginseng ginseng in a pot . 
At the end of the class , Harry was like all the others : sweaty , wet , and all around . 
People went to the castle to shower in a hurry before hurrying into the classroom . 
Studying with Professor McGonagall is always stressful , but today it is especially difficult . 
Every last year Harry learned to be leaking out of his mind during the summer . Should turn a beetle into a button , it can only do one thing to make the beetle tired of hearing because of the lon ton run across the table to avoid its wand . 
Ron is even bigger . 
He welded his wand with a tape of someone else's spell . 
But the wand seemed to have been damaged beyond repair . 
It kept cracking and flaming at times , and every time Ron tried to turn the beetle into a button , the wand burned in the smoke , drowning Ron in the thick , smoky gray sea . the smell of rotten eggs . 
Ron did not see anything , so he accidentally crushed his beetle under his elbow . 
She asked for a new beetle and Professor McGonagall was not happy about it . 
When the school bell rings , Harry breathes a sigh of relief . Its head is now a loose piece of cloth . 
Everybody was anxious to make arrangements to get out of the classroom , except for Harry and Ron , who were still furiously scouring their scarves on the head . 
- stupid idiots 
The wand blurted out a burst of explosions like a cannon . 
Harry suggested : 
- Or do you write home letter please another ? 
- Oh , yes , to receive another Thunder letter ? The wand of the broken child is your own fault . 
Hmmm 
Ron chopped the wand while he was whispering in his bag . 
They all went to lunch . 
At the dining room , Hermione showed them the perfect coat she had just produced . 
But that does not make anyone happy at all . 
Harry immediately changed the subject : 
- What time do we have a subject ? 
Hermione replied immediately : 
- The Art of Prevention . 
Ron took a look at Hermione's schedule : 
- Why are you starring all of Lockhart's classes like this ? 
Hermione fumbled , resuming the timetable . 
When they finished lunch , they went out to play in the shady yard . 
Hermione sat down on a stone stepping - stone and wandered off to the void . Wandering with the Vampires . 
Harry and Ron talked about Quidditch for a while , and Harry realized he was being watched closely . 
He looked up , catching a tiny , gray - haired mouse that he had seen at the ceremony yesterday . 
Harry looked at Harry as if hypnotized . 
He was holding onto something that looked like a typical Muggle camera . 
As soon as Harry caught sight of the kid , the kid blushed . 
- How are you , Harry ? 
I'm Colin Ceevey . 
The boy said as breathless , hesitant step to one step . 
- I'm also in Gryffindor's house . 
Do you mind if I take a picture of you ? 
He raised his camera and asked , hopeful . 
Harry hesitated repeatedly : 
- Take a picture ? 
Colin moved a little further , eagerly saying , 
- to show that I met you . 
I know all about you . Everyone told me everything . 
About how he survived when Know - Who - who - was - trying to kill him and how he disappeared and all sorts of things about how he had scarring . lightning on the forehead . ( The eyes of the young man looked at his hair on Harry's forehead . ) And one of his roommates said that if he used the right toilet paper , the picture would budge . 
Colin took a deep breath , then trembled nervously , saying , 
- This is strange here ? 
Before I did not know all the odd things you do is a miracle , until you receive a letter to Hogwarts . 
Daddy is a milk seller , he also can not believe there is a magic school . 
So I shot a bunch of pictures sent home to see . 
If I have a picture of you , that's good 
He looked at Harry with pleading : 
- Or do you have a camera , and you stand next to me ? Then he signed the picture home ? 
- Give a photo ? 
Are you distributing autographed photos , Potter ? 
The rude Malfoy echoed through the school grounds . 
He stopped at the back of Colin , pairing up with two crouched gangsters , Crabbe and Goyle . It's also a trio at Hogwarts . 
Malfoy roared with the crowd : 
- Everyone hurry up ! 
Harry Potter is broadcasting a signature ! 
Harry gripped his fist , shouting : 
- I do not do it . Shut up , Malfoy . 
Colin , who had a body that was just as big as Crabbe's crotch neck , tried to shout : 
- Only you jealous ! 
- Giving ? 
Malfoy did not need to raise his voice because half of the school is now listening to him . 
- What is the message ? 
I do not need a scar in the forehead ? 
Thank you 
I do not think I have to split my head to make myself special . 
Crabbe and Goyle laughed dumbly . 
Ron said , 
- You eat the snail , Malfoy ! 
Crabbe stopped laughing , beginning to rub his fist with a threatening look . 
Malfoy contemptuously mocked : 
- Watch out , Weasley ! 
You do not want to stir , lest your mother came to the school to pull you back . 
He parodied in a shrill , shrill voice : 
- If you hit a toe over the limit . 
A fifth - year Slytherin crowd laughed . 
Malfoy laughed again . 
- Weasley wanted a signature picture of yours , Potter . 
That picture is more valuable than the block it gathers 
Ron pulled out his duct tape , but Hermione closed the vampire again and said softly : 
- Watch ! 
Lockhart was striding toward them , his turquoise robes flying in the background : 
- What's going on ? 
What is going on ? Who is distributing autographed photos ? 
Harry gaped at his throat as Lockhart's arm slipped over his shoulder and his thunderous , cheerful voice resounded : 
- I should not have asked ! 
Harry , we meet again ! 
Clamped on Lockhart's side and heated up by embarrassment , Harry saw Malfoy slip into the crowd with a smug smile . 
Brother Lockhart smiled at Colin : 
- Take it , Creevey . 
It's not as beautiful as both of us , and both of us will sign the photo for you . 
Colin fumbled with the camera , he just finished shooting , the ringing bell signaled the afternoon session began . 
- Just go , go to class . 
Lockhart told the pupils in the yard , then returned to the castle with Harry still clamped under one arm . 
Harry just wished to know the mantra that would make him disappear . 
Once inside the castle , Lockhart spoke in his father's voice to Harry : 
- I have some wise advice for this , Harry . 
I shielded the game in front of Creevey's lens . 
If there is a picture in my photo that I'm standing with , my friends will not think it's bragging 
Harry stammered when Lockhart pulled him down the corridor and up the stairs . 
The pupil stood long along the path to stare at two people . 
- let me tell you that , just like the game where the presentation of the signed photo is not very smart - looks like a child in his head , said it , Harry . 
Then the time will come , as I am here , to where to go to fill the picture , but 
Teacher laughed crispy : 
- I did not think it was that day . 
They both went to Lockhart's class , and he finally released Harry . He pulled his robes neatly and went to find a seat at the bottom of the class , pretending to be busy piling up all seven of Lockhart's works in front of him , to avoid looking at the author's face . . 
The other students were dragged into the classroom , Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry . 
Said Ron : 
- Your face is so hot that you can fry it . 
You should pray to Creevey that he should not meet Ginny , otherwise the two of them will set up a club of Harry Potter fans . 
Harry pours : 
- Shut up . - It only takes a few hours for the Harry Potter fan club to lock in Lockhart . 
As the whole class sat down , Mr. Lockhart cleared his throat loudly , all silent . 
He stepped forward , taking the Voyage with giant monsters , Neville's version , raised to reveal a portrait of himself winking at the cover of the book . 
He pointed at the portrait and winked at himself : 
I , Gilderoy Lockhart , the Merlin Medal , the third , the Honorary Member of the Anti - Communist League , five consecutive wins of the Wizarding Week's Most Glamorous Smile - But I Do not Talk about it . 
I did not throw away the Death Goddess by smiling at her ! 
He stopped to wait for the students to laugh , some of them smiled nervously . 
- I see all of you have bought all my books . 
Well I see today we can start with a small test . 
There is nothing to worry about - just to see how you read the book , how much . 
When he finished the examination paper and returned to the podium , he said : 
- You have thirty minutes to do the Beginning ! 
Do it ! 
Harry looked down at the examination paper and read : 
first . 
What color is Gilderoy Lockhart most favorite ? 
2 . 
What is the mystery of Gilderoy Lockhart ? 
3 . 
So far , what is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest accomplishment ? 
So , such questions continue to be three pages , to the last sentence is : 
54 . 
Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday on what day ? 
And what is the ideal gift for the teacher ? 
Half an hour later , Lockhart collected his student's paper and read it in front of the class : 
- Wow ! 
Wow ! Looks rare to remember that my favorite color is purple lilac cloves hả ! 
I wrote that in One Year with the Snowman . 
Some games need to read the book Wandering with Vampires further . I made it clear in chapter 12 that my ideal birthday present should be a compromise between the magical and non - magical people . Of course , with a gift like a large , long - standing Ogden , I would not deny it . 
He gave the students a mischievous look . 
Ron was now looking at Lockhart with unmistakable looks on his face ; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas sitting in front of him were trembling at him for trying to hold back their laughter . 
Hermione , on the other hand , was listening attentively , so startled at the mention of his name : 
- but Hermione knew my secret ambition was to get rid of the evil world and to market a hairdresser that I made myself . 
Indeed a good girl ! maximum point ! 
Where is Hermione ? 
He snapped his finger on the paper , and Hermione shook her hand . 
Brother Lockhart beamed : 
- Excellent ! 
The fruit is excellent ! 
Ten points for the Gryffindor ! 
And now on the job only ! 
He bent down to the back of the teacher's desk , lifting a cage up to the table . 
- Now , let's take a look ! 
My job is to equip the weapon against the worst creatures that the wizarding world knows ! 
You will find yourself going through the most terrible fear in this room . 
Rest assured that when I am here , there is no danger . 
I just ask you to keep calm . 
He tried to hold back his strength and finally could not help but to lean over the books to see the cage better . 
Lockhart put a hand on the lid of the cage . 
Dean and Thomas stopped laughing . 
Neville sat cowering at the table . 
Brother Lockhart lowered his voice : 
- I ask you not to scream . 
The loud screams can provoke them . 
As the whole class held their breath for a moment , Lockhart opened the cover . 
He spoke as if on the stage : 
- Yes , Cornish lovers have been arrested . 
Seamus can not hold it anymore . 
It turned out to be a scream that even Lockhart could not mistake for the scream . 
He smiled at Seamus : 
- Star ? 
Seamus nearly breathed a sigh of laughter : 
- Yes , they are not so bad that it's dangerous ? 
- Do not think unconsolidated ! 
Lockhart shook his finger at Seamus in disgust . 
- They can become devilish spirits . 
The blue baby darling and two inches high . 
They have sharp faces and loud voices sound like demons fighting . 
As soon as the lid of the new cage was released , they were shouting at each other , running around in the cage , shaking the bouncing balloons , making faces scare the children sitting near it . 
Lockhart said loudly : 
- okay , to see what they think about them ! 
He opened the cage door . 
They took several ink jars around the classroom , tearing the children's books 
Classroom immediately became a mystery . 
Kids love to shoot in all directions like rockets . 
The two grabbed Neville's ear and lifted it up into the air . 
Many of them shot straight into the window , splattering the broken glass into the babies flying to the back . The love of the rest began to break the classroom more horrible than a mad rhino . 
They scooped up spray bottles all over the classroom , torn the children's books , stripped the walls off the counter , pulled the bin up , pulled up the briefcase , took the book and threw it out through the cracked window . 
In the blink of an eye , half of the class had to crawl under the refugee table . 
Neville swayed to the ceiling , clinging to the hanging light . 
Lockhart shouted , 
- The game in their uncatched ! 
Get them back ! 
They are just some darling ! 
He rolled his sleeve , swinging his wand and humming : 
- Peskipiksi Pesternomi ! [ ( Peski = destructive , Pester = vermin . 
This mantra can be translated as : love chess , love chess , smart chess , then quit swiftly ! ) ] 
The mantra has no effect at all . 
A child loves to wrest the wand , but always throw out the window . 
Lockhart choked down his neck , dipping under the table , barely being crushed by Neville as he dropped the suspension light . 
The bell rings , everyone rushes out the door like crazy . 
Relative calm , Lockhart straightened up , saw Harry , Ron , and Hermione was approaching the door , he said : 
- Oh , I intend to assign the task of collecting the remaining children love to fly to the teacher . 
As soon as he finished speaking , he walked quickly past their faces and hurried to close the door behind him . 
Suddenly a child rushed , rattled Ron's ears , Ron roared in pain : 
- Can you believe me ? 
Hermione points at a point when the two children love the spell chilled frozen , just dropped them in the cage , she said : 
- You want us to have practical experience . 
- Intership . 
Harry exclaimed , while trying to capture a darling who danced out of his reach , sticking his tongue out to tease him . 
- Hermione , you do not understand what I'm doing ! 
- Coincidence . 
You read his book and then - he has done so many amazing things . 
Ron murmured : 
- that's him ! 
Chapter 7 : BLOOD AND THINGS 
A few days later Harry spent most of his time shunning Lockhart when he met the teacher in the hallway . 
But avoiding Colin Creevey is even harder . 
That boy seemed to memorize Harry's entire schedule . 
It does not seem to make him better than asking six or seven times a day : Harry , how are you ? To hear Harry say again : Hi Colin , no matter how Harry's voice is . 
The owl Hedwig was still angry at Harry about the car wreck . 
Ron's wand was still immortal , the morning of Friday had automatically jumped out of Ron's hands during the study of spells and pins between Flitwick's eyebrows , causing a boil . swelling on the spot . 
It was all over this story , so Harry was so happy when it came to the weekend . 
He , Ron and Hermione planned to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning . 
But that morning , while still able to sleep well for several hours , it was Oliver Wood wake up . 
Wood is the Gryffindor's Quidditch school team . 
Harry was still sleepy : 
- What's going on ? 
Wood urged : 
- go to Quidditch ! 
Hurry up ! 
Harry glances out the window . 
A thin mist spread across the sky is yellowing . 
Now waking up , Harry did not understand how he could have slept in the hustle and bustle of the birds out there . 
Harry whined : 
- Brother Oliver ! 
It's bright ! 
- right ! 
Said Wood . 
This guy is a high school student sixth , is now burning with enthusiasm to the eyes flash . 
Wood said cheerfully : 
- this is part of our new training program , get up ! 
Take the brush with you ! 
No team has started training yet ; We will be opening this year's training season 
Harry yawned and shivered slightly . 
He crawled out of bed , groping for Quidditch clothes . 
Wood said : 
- Well done ! 
See you in the football field in fifteen minutes . 
Having found the purple Quidditch suit and covering it with warm robes , Harry scribbled a letter , explaining to Ron where he was going . 
Then it went down the spiral staircase , into the living room , with the Nimbus 2000 broomstick on his shoulder . 
She had just come to the portraiture Mrs. Beo heard the clatter behind and saw Colin plunge down the stairs , the camera swaying like mad at the neck , and the hand was holding tight . that . 
- Brother Harry ! 
I heard someone calling his name on the stairs . 
I see you have something ! 
I have finished washing the picture , I want to show you 
Harry looked at the pictures Colin pointed out just below his nose : 
A black - and - white lockhart was pulling an arm that Harry recognized as his hand . 
He was pleased to see that the image of it was trying to resist , not to be dragged into the frame . 
As he saw in the photograph , Lockhart succumbed , lost all his composure , and breathed into the white border of the photograph . 
Colin asked earnestly . 
- Do you sign autobiography ? 
- Are not . 
Harry said firmly , his eyes widening around the room to make sure no one was in the room . 
" I'm sorry , Colin , but you're practicing Quidditch . 
Harry climbed over the hole portrays Mrs. Beo . 
Colin crawls through Harry's hole . 
- Oh , great ! 
Wait for me ! 
I've never seen a Quidditch match before . 
- Bored ! 
Harry said quickly , but Colin did not even listen to him , his face flushed with excitement . 
- You have been the youngest striker in the last hundred years , have not you Harry ? Do not you ? 
Colin whispered to Harry and said , 
- You must be very good . 
I never fly . 
Is not it easy ? 
Is that your broom ? Is it the best broom ? 
Harry did not know how to get rid of him . 
It hurts like someone has to wear a shady lip . 
Colin kept saying no to stop breathing : 
- I do not know anything about Quidditch . 
Is it true that there are four balls ? 
Is it true that there are two professional balls that knock players out of the brushes ? 
Harry had to explain the complex rules of Quidditch , saying harshly : 
- Right . 
Those two balls called the Bludger . 
There are two attackers in each team holding the bludger out of his team . 
Two brothers , Fred and George , are Gryffindor's attackers . 
- What are some other balls used for ? 
Colin asked as he jumped a few steps because he was gaping at Harry for a moment . 
- Well , the Quaffle - the biggest red ball - is the ball used to score the goal . 
The three players of each Quaffle team gave each other a try and threw it into the post at the end of each pass . 
There are three golf clubs with three rounds . 
- The fourth ball 
- A golden Snitch . 
It is very small , very fast , and very difficult to catch . 
But that is the job that must be done . 
Because a Quidditch match can not end if no one catches Snitch . 
Any team that captures the Snitch wins a hundred and fifty points for his team . 
Colin asked respectfully : 
- And you are the Gryffindor rivals , right ? 
Two people came out of the castle and started crossing the dewy grassy night . 
Harry said : 
- Right . 
And there is a captain . 
He defended the post . 
Oh , that's it . 
But Colin still did not stop asking Harry all the way down the grass to Quidditch . 
Harry just pulled the boy out when he got into the dressing room . 
Colin called after Harry in a blunt voice like a flute : 
- I'm going to get a good seat for you Harry ! 
So the boy climbed up to the stage . 
The others in the Gryffindor team were in the dressing room . 
Wood is the only one who looks completely alert . 
Fred and George , hips , hair and makeup , are sitting idly by Alicia Spinnet . 
This fourth - year student seems to be nodding to the back wall . 
The other two are Katie Bell and Angeline Johnson sitting opposite them , yawning yawn . 
Wood said quietly : 
- Behold , how come you so late ? 
Now , I have a few short words with all of you before we go to practice , because you spent the summer to set up a new training program . 
This program , he really believes will change all 
When Wood begins his new tactical presentation , Fred's head falls to the right , 
Wood is holding a Quidditch yard graph , in which he draws countless horizontal lines and arrows in various ink colors . 
Wood drew out his wand , tapping on the map , the arrows beginning to crawl like worms . 
When Wood begins his new jutsu , Fred's head falls to his right , resting on Alicia's shoulder , and begins to snore . 
Wood took about twenty minutes to explain the first plan , just after that the second plate appeared , and under the second one was the third one . 
Harry is immersed in the state of pretense while Wood is said to know each other . 
At the end of the end , Wood ended in two hours : 
- That's it 
Harry was pulled out of a nostalgic dream , with as much food as he was about to enjoy at the breakfast table in the castle . 
- Is that all ? 
Any questions ? 
George was awake to wake up : 
- I have a question , Oliver . 
Why did not you tell us all this yesterday , when we were still awake ? 
Wood is not happy at all . 
He scowled at the crowd , saying : 
- Hey , all the people here . 
We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year . 
We easily become the best team . 
Unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond our reach 
Harry struggled on the couch because of guilt . 
He was unconscious in a void during the Quidditch final of the previous school year ; Harry's absence , Gryffindor's lack of a player and a worst defeat in three hundred years . 
Wood paused for a moment to regain his composure . 
The last battle was obviously still tormented by him . 
- So this year we have to practice diligently than ever before , let's go out and practice the new theory ! 
Wood shouted , grabbing his broomstick , paving the way out of the dressing room . 
Followed by the players in the team , whoever the legs are stiff , mouth yawn to mouth jaw . 
The team has been in the room for so long that the sun is now rising , although there is still a slight frost on the grass in the stadium . 
As Harry walked into the courtyard , he saw Ron and Hermione sitting side by side on the stage . 
Asked Ron suspiciously : 
- Are you done ? 
- Not yet started ! 
Said Harry , looking at the enormous pieces of toasted bread that Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Hall . 
It says : 
- Wood just taught the new tactics of photography . 
He climbed up the broomstick , trotting down to the ground one by one , soaring into the air . The cool morning glow over his face made it faster than Wood's long speech . Getting back to Quidditch is fantastic . 
It ran all the way around the stadium , racing with Fred and George . 
As they rounded a corner of the stadium , Fred exclaimed , 
- What is so funny ? 
Harry looked down at the stage . 
Colin was sitting on one of the highest benches , the camera held high , taking all of the picture to the other , the strangely tapping noise in the vast , deserted stadium . Butt . 
The boy exclaimed : 
- Look , Harry ! 
Look here ! 
Fred asked : 
- Who's that ? 
Harry lied : 
- I do not know . 
It speeds up so far as far as Colin is concerned . 
Wood , face serious , gliding in the air toward them . 
He asked : 
- What's wrong ? 
Why did the first kid photograph ? 
I do not like it at all . 
It could be a Slytherin spy , trying to discover our new training . 
Harry hurriedly said : 
- He's a Gryffindor student . 
George added : 
" And Slytherin does not need spies here , Oliver . 
Wood asked resentfully : 
- Based on where you say so sure ? 
- Because they were here in person . 
George said and pointed to Wood . 
Many people in green robes are going into the stadium , hand broom . 
Wood angrily hissed : 
- Unbelievable ! 
I signed up for the stadium today ! 
We have to make this possible . 
Wood plunged to the ground , in anger so he landed slightly stronger than intended , causing him to wobble a little as he climbed down from the broom . 
Harry , Fred and George followed . 
Wood shouted at the Slytherin captain : 
- Flint ! This is the time to practice . 
We prepared special ! 
They're out of here right now ! 
Marcus Flint is more dead than Wood . 
With an evil look on his face , he replied , 
- Lack of room for all of us , Wood ? 
Angeline , Alicia , and Katie have also come . 
The Slytherins had no daughters - they were standing on each other's shoulders , facing Gryffindor , challenging . 
Wood spat out anger fiercely : 
- But I registered the training ground ! 
Tao has pre - registered ! 
Flint says : 
- A ! 
But I also have a special permit signed by Professor Snape : I , Professor Snape , allow Slytherin to practice at Quidditch today because of the need for new rugby coaches . 
Wood scattered , ask immediately : 
- Do you have a new look ? Where ? 
Behind six - strong players standing in front of Wood appeared a seventh player , smaller children , smiled contemptuously on the pale pale face . that is Draco Malfoy . 
Fred looked at Malfoy in disbelief : 
Are you the son of Lucius Malfoy ? 
" You dare to mention Mr. Lucius Malfoy is true . 
Flint said as his team grinned : 
- to give us the present of the generous gift he gave to Slytherin . 
All seven players of the Slytherin uniform raised their broom . 
Seven brand new glossy brushes are extremely shiny and seven gold - plated chunks of Nimbus 2001 sparkle in the morning sunlight in front of the Gryffindor . 
- the most modern . 
Only last month . 
Flint said with indifference , hands clutching a dust at his broomstick . 
- I believe it's far out of the old 2000 , more than enough . Like the old Cleansweep , it's only worth scouring . 
[ Clean : clean ] Sweep : There are two meanings : sweep , fast . 
Here Flint mockingly points to Sweep the sweeping meaning . ] 
He grinned at Fred and George , both of whom were clutching Cleansweep 5 . 
For a moment no one in Gryffindor spoke any words . 
Smirk on Malfoy's face broadening to the ear so that his cold eyes were only two slits . 
Flint said again . 
- Well . 
Look ! 
An encroachment . 
Ron and Hermione were crossing the lawn to see what was going on . 
Ron asked Harry : 
- What's going on ? 
Why do not you practice ? 
What does it do here ? 
Ron was staring at Malfoy in Slytherin's robes . 
Malfoy said in a shaky voice : 
- I'm the new Slytherin rivals , Weasley . 
People are admiring the broom that my father gave the team . 
Ron rolled his eyes wide and eyed seven new brooms in front of him . 
Malfoy said quietly : 
- so beautiful ? 
But maybe the Gryffindor team can also raise some gold to change the broom . 
We should sell the Cleansweep 5 brooms ; I will buy them ! 
Slytherin players burst out laughing . 
Said Hermione , 
At least no one in Gryffindor must buy his place . 
They were recruited into pure talent . 
The grin on Malfoy's face flickered like a candle in the wind . 
He spits it out : 
- You ask me , you dirty Mudblood . 
Harry knew immediately that Malfoy had said something very bad , because his words had just ended up getting angry at the roar of anger . 
Flint must storm in front of Malfoy to prevent Fred and George from jumping on it . 
Alicia shrieked . 
He angrily pointed his wand at Malfoy's face , hiding under Flint's arm . 
- How dare you ? 
Ron reached for his robes and drew out his wand , screaming , 
- You pay for that , Malfoy ! 
He was angry at Malfoy's face and was hiding under Flint's arm . 
An explosion echoed throughout the campaign and a ray of blue flashed from Ron's chopsticks , rising on his stomach , causing it to fall backward , rolling in the grass . 
Cried Hermione : 
- Ron ! 
Ron ! Are you OK ? 
Ron opened his mouth to speak , but could not speak . 
Instead of talking , it burrows a scary one and a snail splashes out of his mouth , falling to his thigh . 
The Slytherin laughed to death . 
Flint laughed to his feet , clinging to his brand new broom . 
Malfoy laughed at the cow crawling down , clenching his fist on the ground . 
The Gryffindor team surrounded Ron . 
It still continues to spray the big snail . 
No one seems to want to touch it . 
Harry said to Hermione : 
" We brought him to Hagrid's house , his last home . 
Hermione bravely nodded , and Ron's two arms lifted . 
Colin ran down the runway , now running around with Harry and Hermione as they helped Ron out of the field . 
- What's up , Harry ? 
What's going on ? Ron is sick ? 
Can you treat the picture ? 
Ron's mouth ached , and another snail jumped out . 
- Oh , Harry , can you keep him ? 
The boy was fascinated by the scene , holding the camera on the press . 
Harry was angry : 
- go away , Colin ! 
Hermione and Ron help out of the stadium , crossing the playground , toward the edge of the forest . When Hagrid's hut appeared in sight , Hermione said , 
- Almost there , Ron . 
It's just you're almost there 
They were only six to seven feet to Hagrid's house , and the door to the hut was opened . 
But not old Hagrid stepped out . 
It was Gilderoy Lockhart who wore the lavender floral blouse today , striding forward . 
Harry hastily hissed : 
- Hurry up , escape here . 
He pulled Ron out of the bushes nearby , and Hermione had to hide , reluctantly . 
Lockhart shouted loudly to Hagrid : 
- It's just a simple matter if you know what I'm doing . 
When I need help , I know where to find me ! 
I will lend you my book . 
I was surprised that you did not have a book . 
I will sign a booklet tonight and send it to you . 
Well , hi ! 
Then Lockhart strode towards the castle . 
Harry waited until Lockhart left the room to pull Ron out of the bushes and go to the door of Hagrid's house . 
They urge the door . 
Hagrid appeared immediately , his face flabbergasted . 
But when he realized who the guests were , his face immediately brightened up : 
- are wondering as long as we fly to play Free , go away ! 
Imagine Professor Lockhart turning around . 
Harry and Hermione helped Ron through the corner into Hagrid's hut . 
Inside there was a huge bed that occupied a corner , while the other was a warm fire burning with fire , firewood blaring . 
Ron sat down on a chair , Harry explained the trouble they faced , but Hagrid did not seem to be worried about Ron's vomiting . 
He placed a large bronze pot in front of Ron to catch the snail , cheerfully said : 
- Odor is better than swallowing . 
Give them all away Ron . 
Hermione looked at Ron who was vomiting in the pot , anxiously saying : 
- I can not do anything other than wait until the vom all . 
The poisoned spell has come at the right time , but the wand is broken 
Hagrid gasped in the tea room . 
The big dog hunter was Fang's little kid with Harry . 
As Fang was scratching his ear , Harry asked , 
- What did Lockhart want you to do ? 
Hagrid elected : 
- Advise him about eviction from the well . 
He prepared the half - eaten cock to the worn - out parrot table , to put a teacup on it , and then said , 
- Like I do not know ! 
It also exploded to a certain god of death which he expelled . 
If that's not the case , then I swallow the whole thing . 
Harry looked at Hagrid , surprised that he had never criticized a Hogwarts professor before . 
However , Hermione , slightly more accent than usual : 
- I see you slightly unfair . 
Certainly Professor Dumbledore chose Lockhart because he thought he was the most suitable person 
- Is not he the only one taking that job ? 
Hagrid laid out a candy cane while Ron was still croaking in the pot . 
- And you say the only one . 
It is difficult to find anyone who will take the field of anti - black art . 
People do not like to mess with that stuff , do you understand ? 
People are starting to believe that the subject of the subject is crashing . 
So far no one has done that job for a long time . 
Now tell me about it . 
He nodded at Ron , asking , 
- Whose curse it was ? 
" Malfoy scolded Hermione with something - it was probably too bad , because anyone could hear it too . 
Ron raised his head from the table , his face pale , his voice hoarse : 
- Too bad . 
Malfoy calls Hermione Mudblood Hagrid ! 
Unsurprisingly , Ron ducked off the table because another snail wanted to jump out . old Hagrid was angry . 
Growling with Hermione : 
- Who says Malfoy ? 
Hermione replies : 
- It says that . 
But I do not understand the meaning of it . 
Of course you can guess it's vulgar 
Ron raised his head and said , 
- that's the most offensive thing he can think of . Mudblood is the Mudblood , the scorn of calling a Muggle - born person - a parent who is not a witch . 
There are sorcerers - like the Malfoys , for example - who claim to be nobler than others because of what they call pure bloodlines . 
Ron buried a small snake , spit out a snail with palms spread out . 
He tossed the slug into the pot and said , 
- I mean , we all know that blood is not for everyone . 
Take you Neville - she's wearing pure blood sorcery , so building a cauldron is not finished anymore . 
Hagrid added with pride : 
- And those purebloods did not have a curse that our Hermione can not do ? 
His words made Hermione's face flush like gac . 
Ron took a trembling hand and wiped his sweat from his forehead , saying , 
- Disgusting people so bad actually . 
Blood Mud , that is , ordinary blood , not blood noble witch . 
Serious is funny . 
Besides , most witches today are hybrid . 
If we do not marry Muggle then we are already extinct . 
Ron leaned forward from the table . 
Hagrid said loudly , 
- I do not bother you about cursing him , Ron . 
But luckily my wand pointed me in the wrong direction . 
But if you cursed Malfoy , then Lucius Malfoy is still in the school . 
At least like this , I was in trouble with him . 
Harry wanted to say that trouble can not be worse than the snail from his mouth jumping out . 
But it can not open mouth . 
Hagrid's honey made his teeth stick together . 
- Oh , Harry ! 
Hagrid suddenly shouted as if suddenly remembered something : 
- Well , there is something to do with you here . 
Have you been distributing autographed photos ? 
Why do not you have any plates ? 
Harry frowned want to jaw line , for two teeth apart . 
She said impatiently : 
- I did not give you any signatures . 
If Lockhart would spread 
But Hagrid laughed : 
- Uncle just kidding . 
He patted Harry's back affectionately , but he nearly slammed his face down on the table . 
- You know I did not do that . 
Uncle Lockhart told me you do not have to . 
You do not need to try to be more famous than him . 
Harry sat up , rubbed his chin : 
- You do not like to hear that . 
Hagrid winked : 
- Uncle knows he does not like it either . 
And then he told him he had not read his book yet , so he decided to go . 
Sweet candy , Ron ? 
He asked Ron when he saw his head pop up on the table . 
Said Ron : 
- Yes , no . 
Thank you . 
I do not risk my life . 
As Hermione and Harry finished their tea , Hagrid said , 
In the small vegetable garden behind Hagrid's hut there were about a dozen large barbarians 
- The children came to see what the plant growers . 
In the small vegetable garden behind Hagrid's hut , there was a dozen large barbells that Harry had never seen before . 
Which fruit is the size of a large rock . 
Hagrid said cheerfully . 
- the gang is too cool ? For the party that evening Ma had to be sure that they were just big enough . 
Harry asked : 
- What fertilizer do they fertilize ? 
Hagrid looked over his shoulder to see if anyone else was . 
- Well , give them a little They know that a little call for help only 
Harry noticed that Hagrid's pink rose umbrella was set up on a cliff wall . 
It was before Harry had reason to believe that the umbrella was not a mediocre umbrella like the appearance of it . 
Frankly , Harry had the impression that the old Hagrid wand left in school was hidden in the umbrella . 
Hagrid was not allowed to use magic . 
He was kicked out of Hogwarts School in his third year , but Harry never knew why - just to mention it was Hagrid loudly and his ears suddenly mysteriously deaf , until Change conversation topic . 
Hermione half disagreed , half excitedly commented : 
- I guess you use a spell , do not you ? 
Uncle do very well . 
Hagrid nodded to Ron : 
- My sister also told him so . 
Just met her yesterday . 
He glanced at Harry , his great beard twitching slightly : 
She said she was just hanging around the playground , but she guessed she was hoping to meet someone at her house . 
He winked at Harry : 
- If you consulted him , she said that she did not refuse a signature 
- Oh , do not say it again ! 
Ron could not hold back a laugh , causing the snails to drop to the ground . 
Hagrid roared : 
- Watch ! 
He grabbed Ron out of his precious pumpkin . 
It was nearly lunch time , but Harry has only a few candies from morning till now . 
So it was very eager to get to school . 
They greeted Hagrid and went to the castle . 
Ron still coughs occasionally , but only two tiny snails . 
As they set foot on the cool lobby , a voice said , 
- Here we are , Potter and Weasley . 
They will enforce a ban on tonight . 
That is Professor McGonagall . 
She was walking towards them , with a serious expression . 
Ron tried to forget a burp , asking : 
- Ladies , what are we going to do ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- You will polish silver in the traditional room with Filch . 
And do not use magic , Weasley . 
Just use your hands . 
Ron struggled with pain . 
Supervisor Argus Filch is the most hated student in school . 
Professor McGonagall went on to say to Harry : 
" And , Potter , you're going to help Lockhart answer the letter from the admirer . " 
Harry earnestly pleaded : 
- Oh , ma ' am , please let me do it in the traditional room to go to her . 
Professor McGonagall raised his eyebrows : 
- Certainly not . 
Professor Lockhart specifically asked him to come to work with him . 
Both of these memories , at eight o ' clock , began . 
Harry and Ron are moody in the Great Hall in a state of melancholy never seen before . Behind them is Hermione , who brings a face - to - face - to - the - law . 
Harry ate meatballs stuffed with meat was not as delicious as he thought . 
Both Ron and Ron felt they were going to have something worse . 
Ron grumbled : 
- Sure , Filch will make me work all night . 
And do not use magic ! 
In the traditional room there are hundreds of trophies , but little ? 
I do not have a thorough cleaning of the Muggle way . 
Harry sighed and said , 
- I am willing to trade for it at any time . 
Back at the Aunt Dursleys , I used to do all sorts of work . 
But the answer to the letters of those who admire Mr. Lockhart Devil , he would be a nightmare . 
Saturday afternoon is to go east ! 
At eight o ' clock in the morning , the time seemed to stand , Harry trudged along the second floor corridor to Lockhart's office . 
She knocked on the door . 
The door opened immediately . 
Lockhart smiled and looked at him . 
- A ! Here , the fishy little fish ! 
Come on , Harry . 
Come in . 
In the room lit many candles , illuminated numerous pictures framed by Lockhart who hung the walls . 
Some photos were even signed by the teacher . 
A large pile of other pictures are lying on the table . 
Lockhart said to Harry , 
- The address on the envelope . 
He said in a voice as if Harry had done it as a gift to him . 
- The first letter to Gladys Gudgeon , the blessing to her - one who really admired me . 
Slow time crawling through . 
Harry let Lockhart slip from one ear to the other , only occasionally holding up , and yes and no . Sometimes it also leaves the ear a few words such as : reputation is a frivolous friend changing the eccentric , Harry . 
Hay : Celebrities are as frivolous as they are , remember that . 
The candles grew darker and thinner , sparking candlelight shimmer on Lockhart's portraits of Harry's eyes . 
He still had to move his aching hand on the envelope , perhaps a thousand , to address the name of a certain Veronica Smethley . 
It miserable thought : 
- It's almost time to rest . 
Oh , hurry up , it's time to break up 
Suddenly it hears something . 
Something different from the hiss of burning fireballs and Lockhart's laughter about his admirers . 
It was a voice , a cold voice to the bone , a cold squeaking cold soul : 
- Come here for me to tear you up for me to shred you for me to kill you . 
Harry jumped back and made a drop of purple ink appear on the road in the address of Veronica Smethley . 
She says loudly : 
- What is this ? 
Brother Lockhart said : 
- I know ! 
Six months at the top of the bestseller list ! True is breaking all records ! 
Harry panicked , 
- Not ! 
That voice ! 
Lockhart looked at it suspiciously : 
- Star ? 
Which voice ? 
- The voice said that he did not hear ? 
Lockhart looked at Harry with total amazement : 
- Harry , what are you talking about ? Maybe a bit dizzy ? 
Wow , watch the clock ! 
We work here almost four hours ! 
I can not believe it . 
Time is like a horse , right ? 
Harry did not reply . 
He was listening ear to hear that voice again . 
But there was no sound other than Lockhart's voice telling him not to be as restricted as he once was . 
Harry greeted the teacher , feeling his mind was drooling . 
It was so late that Gryffindor's common room was almost empty . 
Harry went straight to the bedroom . 
Ron has not returned yet . 
Harry in bed , climbing to bed , waiting for you . 
Half an hour later , Ron appeared , stepping into the dark room just rubbing his hands , carrying the smell of poker suffocating . 
He rolled to bed moaning : 
- Your biceps are cramped . 
Filch made a Quidditch cup to the fourteen times he was happy . 
Then a vomit hit the jar luminary jar Special Award For the common good of the school . 
It took hours to clean the slime . How about doing business with Lockhart ? 
Harry lowered his voice to wake up Neville , Dean and Seamus . 
She told Ron exactly the voice she had heard . 
Asked Ron : 
- But Mr. Lockhart said he did not hear anything ? 
Thanks to the moonlight , Harry could see Ron's gaze . 
" Do you think he's lying ? " 
But I do not understand . Even if he is invisible , then also open a new door to the room . 
Harry lay back on his bed , staring at the roof : 
- I know . 
I do not understand . 
Chapter 8 : KNOWLEDGE 
October came , spreading cold wet weather throughout the school grounds and throughout the castle . 
Pomfrey was busy with a flu pandemic spread among students and teachers . 
Her chili syrup juice was extremely effective , but whoever drank it left her ears fuming for hours afterwards . 
Little Ginny , who was gaunt , was forced to drink a little by Percy . 
The smoke immediately rises from under the red hair , making the impression that her head is burning . 
Rain drops were the size of bullets flapping into the glass window of the castle during the last few days of the month . 
Water in the lake rising . 
The flower beds in the garden turned into mud flats . 
And Hagrid's pumpkins were bulging in the shed . 
However , Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for Gryffindor's regular Quidditch rehearsals is unmistakable . 
So there is a scene of Saturday afternoon rain storm , before the festival Ma has a few days that Harry still have to go to Quidditch ; Late to reach the Gryffindor Tower in a wet state like mopping mud , but still muddy . 
The rehearsal that day , even if it did not rain or wind , did not have a happy rehearsal . 
Fred and George have spotted the situation with Slytherin and have witnessed the speed of their new Nimbus 2000 s . 
The Weasley brothers report that the Slytherin players are no different than the seven green shadows soaring in the air like missiles . 
As Harry fumbled along the empty corridor , he suddenly encountered someone as heavy as he was . It's Nick's Headshot , the ghost of the Gryffindor Tower . 
The ghost was staring out the window , looking sad , murmuring alone : 
- does not meet the requirement only half a stool , if 
Harry said : 
- Hello Nick ! 
Nick Headwind startled look around : 
- Hello , hi . 
This ghost wears a feathered hat in curly hair in long curls , and wears a long dress with a large waist , trying to fold . 
This ghost wears a feathered hat on her curly hair in long curls , and wears a long dress with a large waist and a folded neck . 
The collar that covered the cut made Nick's neck almost break . 
The ghost was as pale as smoke , and Harry could see through his body he saw the dark sky and the torrential rain poured out . 
Nick loses his head folded a transparent letter , and then inserted into the pocket is also transparent . 
- Why are you so sad , Potter ? 
Harry said : 
- Looks the same . 
Nick Losing his head in a very handsome way : 
- Well , a matter of no importance does not matter , even if we really want to join . Although we have applied , but obviously we do not meet the requirements . 
Despite his voice , his face was full of bitterness . 
Suddenly she pulled the letter out of her pocket , bursting out : 
- But do you think it worth ? 
Being cut forty - five blunt hammer blunt neckline is also worthy to join the Rider Squad Top no ? 
Harry clearly agreed that he should : 
- Yes , yes ! 
- To tell the truth , no one wants more than me is my head was cut quickly and neatly , to drop out then , I want to say is that it is painful and also more ridiculous . 
But 
Nick Take the letter off to open and read : 
- We can only accept the knights whose heads have completely departed from the body . 
You will have to admit that if you do not like it , you will not be able to participate in the activities of the cavalry like Horses juggle head and Horses use pestle heads in the net . 
So , with great regret , I inform you that you do not meet our requirements . 
Please send to you the best wishes . 
Sir Patrick Delaney - Podmore . 
Nick Suddenly lost his head in an instant : 
Only half the skin and tendon connected my head to my neck ! 
Most people think this is good and it seems like I've lost my head , but , frankly , to Patrick Not - right - to - speak - Delaney - Podmore is not enough . 
Nick Losing his head took a long , long breath , and said in a calm voice : 
- Oh , what makes you sad ? 
Can I help ? 
Harry said : 
- No . 
Unless you know we can get the Nimbus 2001 for free for the upcoming Sly House match . 
The rest of the sentence was drowned out by a claw somewhere near Harry's ankle . 
He looked down and caught a pair of golden eyes as bright as a lamp . 
It was Mrs. Noris , the gray cat of Filch's supervisor . 
The cat can be considered deputy supervisor , effective assistant in Filch's never - ending fight against pupils . 
Nick Sukets Head hurriedly said : 
- You're better off , Harry . 
Filch was not happy at all . 
We have a cold , so , the third year to unintentionally wiggle his brain cluttered across the ceiling of five years . 
He had to clean it all morning . 
Now that he saw him muddy around the place like this 
- Yes . 
Harry hurried away from Mrs. Noris's gaze , but not in time . 
Apparently , there was a telepathy between Mrs. Noris and Filch , so he was secretly absorbed by the secret sympathetic power where his cat discovered Harry . 
From a tapestry on the right side of Harry , Filch suddenly burst out , wheezing , madly seeking the violators of the rules . his head was wrapped in a square scarf and his nose was unusually red . 
He shouted loudly : 
- garbage ! 
His jaw trembled , his gaze glistening with warning as he pointed at the curls from Harry's robes . 
- dirty everywhere ! 
I tell you , I'm fed up ! Follow me , Potter ! 
And then Harry suffered the farewell of the ghost . Nearer Headless , he followed Filch down the stairs , to double the muddy footprints on the floor . 
Harry had never been seen inside Filch's office before . 
There , every student wants to stay away . 
The room was dark , with no window , only illuminated by a single oil lamp that descended from the low curtain . 
The smell of fish fried somewhere in the room . 
Wooden cabinets stand on four walls . 
Based on the sticker on each cabinet , Harry could see that the cabinets contained detailed records of every student that Filch had punished . 
Fred and George both have a closet . 
A carefully polished chain and handcuffs hung dangling on the wall behind Filch's desk . 
Everyone knows that he always begged Dumbledore to allow him to tie his pupils to hang them up on the ceiling . 
Filch took a goose feather out of the ink bottle on the desk and started panting for the parchment . 
He muttered angrily : 
- Any man , no nose , no brain , the mouse is too much for me then Must show a sample Where is it ? 
He pulled out a large roll of parchment paper from the desk drawer , spread it out in front of him , dipped the long black goose feather into the ink jar . 
- Name : Harry Potter . 
Treachery : 
Harry said : 
- Just a little muddy teacher ! 
- Just a little muddy for you , oh baby , but for me it was an hour of scouring ! 
Filch shouted , a drop of nasal water at the tip of his rounded nose swinging uncomfortably . 
- Crime : Dirty castle penalty proposed : 
With his nose bleeding , Mr. Filch looked at Harry with resentment . 
He was holding his breath and waited for the sentence to fall to his head . 
But when Mr. Filch had lowered the goose feather brush , it suddenly sounded an uproar just above the ceiling of the room , causing the oil lamp to swing . 
Filch growled . 
- Peeves ! 
This must catch you ! 
I have to catch you ! 
Without looking back at Harry , Filch ran away from the office , and Mrs. Noris quickly followed her master . 
Peeves are a goblin in school , a hyper - lovers love to grin , living to ruin and misery for others . 
Harry did not like Peeves very much , but now he can not help but feel grateful that he loves her for a moment . 
It was hoped that Filch would be distracted from punishing him for the way Peeves showed up ( this time it sounded like she had broken something big ) . 
I may have to wait for Filch for a long time , Harry sat down on the crooked chair next to the desk . 
At the table , a new piece of paperwork was filled in , and there was another : that was a large envelope , with glossy , glossy paper , with silver letters on the envelope . 
Glancing toward the door to make sure Filch had not returned , Harry picked up the envelope and read : 
KWIKSPELL 
Introductory Course on Introductory Magic 
Strangely , Harry opened the envelope and pulled out a parchment of parchment . 
More silver lettering on the surface of the paper : 
Do you feel distanced from the world of modern magic ? 
Do you feel sorry for not doing simple curses ? 
Have you ever been ridiculed for so bad sorcery ? 
had the answer ! 
Kwikspell is an easy - to - learn training course , resulting in quick , new , guaranteed failures . 
Hundreds of witches and wizards have made it through Kwikspell ! 
Lady Z . 
Nettfes in Topsham writes : 
I could not remember a spell before , and my spell was just a joke in my family ! 
But now , after a Kwikspell course , I became the central character of the gala , and my friends begged me for the Lightning Powder formula ! 
Mr. Warlock D . J . Prod of Didsbury says : 
My wife used to poke fun at my witchcraft , but after only a month of studying KWIkspell , I succeeded , turning my wife into a buffalo ! 
Thank you Kwikspell ! 
With these words enchanted , Harry flips over to see the contents of the rest in the envelope . 
What does Filch want to study in Kwikspell ? 
Does this mean that Filch is not a true witch ? 
Harry had just read : Lesson one : Take a wand ( some good tricks ) , the footsteps in the corridor tell him Filch is back . 
Wrap the parchment in the envelope , just as the door of the room opens . 
Filch seems to have won glory . 
Thay said joyfully to Mrs. Noris : 
- The filing cabinet was extremely valuable ! 
This guy is going to kick Peeves , baby 
His eyes caught Harry and slipped quickly through the Kwikspell envelope . 
At that time , Harry realized belatedly that the envelope was more than half a meter from the original location . 
Filch's livid face suddenly turned red like a brick . 
Harry gong to suffer a raging storm . 
Filch snatched the envelope , threw it unbuckled , angry at the tongue : 
- Did you read that ? 
Harry lied right away : 
- No . 
Filch's lithe hands twisted together . 
- If I knew that I had read my own letter , it was not mine . 
Take that for granted , though 
Harry rubbed his eyes , alert ; Looks like crazy like crazy than ever . 
His eyes were reddish - brown , and one side of his cheeks was torn , and the striped scarf could not hide . 
- then go away ! 
And do not say a word to the soul . However , if you do not read it , go right . I have to write a report on the Elf Peeves ! 
Surprisingly , Harry rushed out of Filch's office , going up the corridor to the stairs . 
Out of the office of Filch without penalty , can be considered as a record achievement at Hogwarts . 
- Harry ! 
Harry ! Is it effective ? 
Nick Suicide Heads off in a study room . 
Harry could see behind the ghost was a whole pile of huge black and yellow filing cabinets , perhaps pouring down from above . 
Nick's head eagerly said excitedly : 
" I've got Peeves in my pants , right above Mr. Filch's office . 
I think that would make Filch let go 
Harry was grateful : 
- Turns out that uncle ? 
Yes , it is very effective , you are not restricted to any penalty . 
Thank you very much , Uncle Nick . 
The ghost walks alongside Harry along the corridor . 
Harry noticed that Nick's Headbutt still held Mr. Patrick's refusal letter . 
Harry said : 
- I wish I could do something for you about the Horseman . 
Nick Suddenly the head stopped abruptly on the path of Harry so it did not stop , stepped through the ghost always . 
It's really regrettable , because passing through a ghost is no different than stepping under a shower fountain . 
Nick's head dizzily said : 
- But there is something else you can do for me . 
Harry , do not know if I have to ask too much . But , well , you probably do not want to 
Harry asked earnestly : 
- What is it ? 
- Oh , this coming Ma festival is my fifth birthday . 
Nick Headache said to finish chest bent back , looks very religious . 
And Harry does not know how to express his attitude , to share joy or to share the anniversary of the death of a ghost ? 
It stammered : 
- Ah , uh ? 
- I will hold a dinner party in one of the big dungeons . 
I invite friends all over the country to come here . 
If you come to the party , it is a great honor for me . 
Of course , Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were warmly welcomed . 
I'm just afraid you want to attend a school party ? 
Nick Losing head watching Harry wait tense . 
Harry said , 
- OK . 
I will attend 
- Oh , the boy is precious ! 
Harry Potter came to my suicide ! 
Then 
Nick's head tilted , then said harshly to Harry : 
- You think he can express in front of Patrick that he noticed how terrified I am and how impressed ? 
- Of course , I will say ! 
Nick's Head smiled brightly at Harry . 
- A birthday party ? 
Cried Hermione ardently . Harry changed and joined Ron and Hermione in the common room . 
He passed the invitation of Nick Close to his two children . 
Hermione is very enthusiastic : 
- I dare say there are not many live people can say they ever went to a ghost party . 
Must be a mystery horror ! 
Ron is doing his toxic work , so it's a little rash . 
It's harsh : 
- What is the dead of the party to celebrate ? 
I hear that bored want to die 
Outside the rain still whipped into the window glass , it was dark as ink . 
But inside the common room , everything was bright and cheerful . 
The fireplace shines on the soft armchairs . 
Students who sit comfortably on chairs reading books , talking , doing homework , or - as in Fred and George - are trying to figure out what will happen if the cannonballs pop out for the living eagle . in the fire eat ? 
Fred rescues a glowing orange dwarf from a class of mysterious lifeguards . 
Now that creature was gently smoldering like a charcoal on the table , with a bunch of curious kids around . 
Harry was about to tell Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course , when the fireball suddenly jumped up into the air , bursting into flames and sparks flashing , frantically flying around . around the room . 
The leader of Percy was frantically screaming at Fred and George . 
From the mouth of the salamander spit out the stars with the most spectacular fruit , and then it flew flameless fire escape , banging bangs rumbling . 
The bustling scene made Harry forget about Filch and the envelope containing the Kwikspell course . 
At the Ma ceremony , Harry stabbed regret that he had promised to go to the party of the ghosts of the ghost of Nick Near Head loss . 
The school is eagerly attending the Ma Society dinner ; The Hall was decorated with Hagrid's giant bumblebee cut into large lanterns so large that the three people who sat there still sat there . 
And everywhere , Dumbledore invited a skeleton dancer to cheer on the Hoi Ma party . 
Hermione reminds Harry in his voice : 
- The promise of a nail . You said you would go to the Death Party . 
At about eleven o ' clock , Harry , Ron , and Hermione ignored the entrance to the Great Hall of Fame . 
Inside the Hall , gold plates , gold cups , silver candles , shining brightly shining call lights . 
But they turned their back and pressed their feet to the dungeons . 
Entrance to Nick's party Near the Head was also lit long candles , but the effect did not cheer up at all . 
The rows of candles were black , burning like ghosts , emitting a spooky blue light , creating a hazy , shimmering atmosphere , even to the faces of living people . 
Every step they take , they feel cold . 
Harry shivered and squeezed the shirt that was tied around him tighter . 
It sounded like thousands of nails scoop up a huge blackboard . 
Ron whispered : 
- Maybe that is called music ? 
Three turned a corner and saw immediately Nick Nears Head was standing in the doorway of the basement hung the black velvet curtains . 
He stood with gloomy grief : 
- My precious friends , welcome to welcome , welcome to be very welcome to welcome you are here 
He lifted his feathered hat , waved it in a curve as he bowed . 
What a wonderful scene ! 
In the dungeon there are hundreds of transparent or white ghosts thanks to , most of them are surfing on the dance floor crowded , waltz dancing , groaning groaning music of a band of thirty the saw , the musicians sitting on a stage to drop the black . 
Above the head of the ghost is a beam of light lit by thousands of black candles , radiating a dark blue light of midnight . 
The three little ones felt like they had stepped into a freezer , their breath becoming mist in front of their nose . 
Harry wants to warm up , suggesting : 
- We take a look around . 
Ron worried : 
- Be careful , do not go through any ghost . 
They passed by a group of goblins , a ragged ghost wearing chains , a chubby priest - the funniest ghost of the Hufflepuffs . 
They carefully walked around the edge of the fluke . 
They passed by a group of goblins , a ragged ghost wearing chains , a chubby priest - the funniest ghost of the Hufflepuffs . 
The Monster Master is talking to a knight ghost with an arrow in the middle of his forehead . 
Harry was not surprised to see the bloody Baron - the Slytherin ghost - a thin , glazed man , his eyes full of blood and silver , standing in an empty place , distracted by other ghosts . 
Hermione suddenly stopped crying : 
- Oh no . 
Come back , come back , I do not want to talk to Myrtle Crying 
The hurry hurry , Harry asked : 
- Who is that ? 
- Is a ghost haunted toilet bowl in the toilet . 
- Does it haunt a toilet ? 
- Well , that toilet broke all year round , because it was going crazy to make the bridge deck always flooded . 
I never used that toilet if I avoided it . 
If you hear it crying , then you can not go to the toilet . 
Ron said , 
- Look at the food ! 
On the other side of the basement was a long table , also covered with black velvet towel . They were eagerly approaching , but only a few steps were stopped , horrified . 
The smell of food is like vomiting . 
There is a large fish hanging on a beautiful silver beach ; Baked pastries to burn as charcoal full of energy on the tray ; a stomach lamb stuffed with lung liver meal mixed with oatmeal ; a green moldy cheese ; And in the most gracious position , a great gray cake is shaped like a grave , on which there are some words painted with black tar pitches : 
HIS NICHOLAS DE MIMSY - PORPINGTON DUE ON 31 SEPTEMBER , 1492 
Harry stared at him , shocked to see a wildstorm walking through the table , his mouth wide open , to bite a terrible salty fish . 
Harry asked the ghost : 
- go through the food like this , tastes good ? 
- Pretty good . 
The sad man replied , then drifted off to another place . 
Hermione expressed understanding : 
- Make sure they leave the rotten food to have a stronger flavor . 
She squeezed her nose as she bent lower to look closer to a littered sheep stomach . 
Said Ron : 
- I went out , I'm upset . 
But they did not even come back when a ghost suddenly jumped from beneath the table and hanged himself in the air in front of the children . 
Harry looked cautious : 
- Hi Peeves ! 
The perverse elf - peeves are very contradictory to pale transparency , unlike any other ghost around . He was wearing a bright orange wedding hat , a necklace of spinning sleeves , and his huge face grinned with a broad smile . 
She pointed out a bowl of peanuts had grown mold , sweetly invited three children : 
- Leaving ? 
Hermione replies : 
- Are not . 
Thank you . 
Peeves ' eyes were confused : 
- Listen to you say bad Myrtle miserable nhé ! 
It was bad with my miserable Myrtle . 
I love to breathe a little and then roared : 
- CAKE MYRTLE ! 
Cried Hermione whisper : 
- Oh , no , Peeves , do not tell her what I say . 
I did not mean it , I do not mind her , hello Myrtle . 
A ghost dwarf rafts , it is the ghost of a girl . 
Harry has never seen a face so mournful . 
his face was hidden behind his smooth and thick hair , shining on pearl - shaped glasses . 
The student girl asked sulkily : 
- What ? 
Hermione said with fake fun : 
- How are you , Myrtle ? 
It is good to be outside the toilet . 
Myrtle snorted . 
The mischievous Peeves fall apart in Myrtle's ear : 
" Hermione just stole her sister . " 
Hermione glared at Peeves , saying , 
- Just say that tonight you look pretty . 
Myrtle looked at Hermione suspiciously : 
- Do you make me laugh ? 
Tears of a crying ghost floated up to the small and transparent eye socket , falling down . 
Hermione tries to sort out : 
- Not really but I just say how much my sister Myrtle ? 
She elbowed Ron and Harry with a frown and Harry made them grimace , but also hurriedly added : 
- Yeah , that's right 
- Yes , Hermione said 
- Do not lie . 
Myrtle sobbed , tears were streaming down myrtle's face now , while my darling Peeves laughed happily at his shoulders . 
- We do not know what we call back what people call me ? 
Myrtle fumbled ! 
Myrtle has lem ! 
Myrtle cried , moaning , mourning , pitying ! 
Peeves hissed at Myrtle's shoulder : 
- I forgot the face of acne again . 
The ghost of Myrtle came out crying and ran away from the dungeon . 
Peeves follows Myrtle , throws peanuts into her , screams loudly : 
- face acne ! 
Face acne ! 
Hermione groaned sadly ; 
- Oh my God ! 
Nick Crossing Head now crossing the crowd to meet the kids : 
- Do not you girl ? 
They lied : 
- Yes , please . 
Nick Sucife Head Pride : 
- It's not bad at all . 
Willow Crying in Kent is coming too Close to now we say a few words , we have to go to the orchestra to prepare . 
However , the orchestra stopped playing at that time . 
The musicians , and all the others in the cellar were silent , looking around nervously as they heard the sound of gunfire and hunting from afar . 
Nick's head whispered bitterly : 
- Oh , come here ! 
Leading the knight is a ghost holding his bearded head under his arm 
Across the wall of the dungeon , a dozen mares came out , each with a headless rider . the crowds clapped their hands like crazy ; Harry clapped his hands as well , but as he glanced at Nick's face , it stopped patted . 
Horses in the middle of the dance floor , stand back , back , forward . 
Head of the knight is a ghost holding his bearded head under the ax ; he blows the jail and from that position . 
The ghost jumped down on the horse , raised his head to look over the crowd ( everyone laughed ) , then strode to Nick Near Head , tucked his head back in the neck . 
It bellow : 
- Nick ! 
How's it goin ? is that still hanging ? 
The ghost laughed enthusiastically and enthusiastically pounding on the shoulder Nick Nick Headache . 
Nick Sucife Head to face dry : 
- Welcome to attend . 
Patrick . 
- Do people live ? 
Patrick realizes the presence of Harry , Ron , and Hermione , pretending to jump backwards one , causing his head to fall to the ground ( the crowd screaming ) . 
Nick's head drowned in a gloomy voice : 
- Interesting . 
Patrick's head said from the ground : 
- do not bother with Nick ! 
He was upset about this we did not let him hunt down ! 
But I'm going to say Look at that guy ! 
Harry said hastily , as he caught sight of the meaning of Nick's Headshot : 
- I see that Nick is very afraid very afraid 
Patrick screamed : 
- Huh ? 
Did he tell you that ? 
Nick Goes head to hear his voice : 
- Please note , please pay attention , I am going to read a speech 
He walked quickly to the platform , climbing up in a cold blue light . 
- Ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , very sorry , this is a great sorrow 
But no one listens . 
Sir Patrick and the other headscarves started their first hornball game ( with a walking stick , a ball , and a swing ) , causing everyone to turn around . 
Nick Losing his head trying to re - attract the attention of the audience in vain . 
He finally gave up when Patrick's head flew over his face and the crowd burst into laughter . 
At this point Harry felt so cold , not to mention hunger hunger . 
Whispered Ron , 
- I can not stand this game . 
Its teeth were scorpions , while the musicians returned to their positions and continued to perform for the crowd to continue pulling to the dance floor . 
Harry agrees : 
- I'm back . 
They walked towards the door , nodded and smiled at anyone who looked at them , and quickly ran out , running back to the corridor that lit the black lights . 
Ron led the group toward the staircase leading up to the Hall of Fame with great hope : 
- I do not eat dessert . 
It was then that Harry heard : 
- tear the dead mince 
It was a cold , bloodthirsty voice that had been heard in Lockhart's office the day before . 
He stopped , pressed his ear against the wall , listened very hard , then looked around , glancing up and down the dimly candlelit hallway . 
- Harry , you are 
- Hold on to that voice again 
- that's too long ago 
- Listen ! 
Harry pleaded , but Ron and Hermione stared at him . 
- It's time to kill 
The voice narrowed . 
Harry must have gone - go up . 
A mixed feeling of fear and thrill cling to it as it looked up at the dark ceiling : how could that person move up ? Is he a ghost so the stone ceiling does not matter ? 
He suddenly shouted : 
- Go this way ! 
Then he started running , running up the stairs , running into the Hall . There is no longer anything to listen to , because the loud noises are coming out of the night party in the Great Hall in all other languages . 
Harry ran a circuit up the marble stairs to the first floor . 
Ron and Hermione followed him . 
- Harry ! 
We are 
- Suit 
Harry listened . 
Far away from the upper floor , the voice was small , but Harry could still hear : 
- I smell our blood BLIND ! 
Harry snapped . 
She yelled : 
- He's going to kill somebody ! 
Ignoring Ron and Hermione's bewildered face , Harry ran up three stairs , trying to hear something other than the sound of his footsteps ringing . 
Harry scurryed around on the second floor , Ron and Hermione running behind him , gasping for breath . 
Until they run to the turn leading to the last corridor , empty . 
Ron whipped his forehead on his face , asking : 
- Harry , all these things ? 
I did not hear anything 
But Hermione gasped , pointing down the corridor : 
- Look ! 
On the wall in front of them there is something bright up . 
They slowly approached , eyes trying to see through the dark . 
Between the two window frames , the three - inch high note was painted on the wall , shimmering in the flickering light of the torches . 
Secret Containers have been opened . 
The Beast of the Successor Be Yourself . 
- What else - the dangling below ? 
Asked Ron in a trembling voice . 
As they inched closer , Harry nearly fell - on the floor there was a large puddle . 
Ron and Hermione took hold of Harry , and the three of them moved closer to the message on the wall , eyes fixed on the dark figure beneath the words . The three immediately recognized what that object was , and jumped back , stomping on the puddles splashing . 
Mrs Norris , Filch's cat , was hanged on the torch . 
I was stiff , my eyes wide , staring . 
The three of us stopped for a moment . 
After a moment , Ron said , 
- We should get out of here soon ! 
Harry confused : 
- Why do not we try to see if it can help it ? 
The laughing voice suddenly subsided as the front people saw the cat hanging upside down . 
Ron : 
- Believe me . 
I do not want to be caught in battle . 
But it's too late . 
There was a loud rumbling sound in the hallway , sounding like thunder from far away . 
It was the end of the party , and from both ends of the corridor they were standing in the midst of the hundreds of footsteps that were climbing the stairs , and the hushed laughter of the children were filled . 
Just a moment later , from both ends of the corridor rushed to countless students . 
The laughing voice suddenly subsided as the front people saw the cat hanging upside down . The crowd rushed forward to look at the horrible scene , while Harry , Ron and Hermione stood apart in the hallway . 
The silence was suddenly heard by a voice : 
- The enemy of his successor , let's soul ! 
The next one is mi , Blood Mud ! 
It's the voice of Draco Malfoy . 
It was in front of the crowd , eyes that were cold now , the face always pale pink now . 
He grinned at the sight of the stiff cat hanging upside down . 
Chapter 9 : MESSAGES IN THE WALL 
- What happened here ? 
What's going on ? 
Certainly Malfoy's shouting made Filch's attention . 
The crowd of parrots came forward . 
Having seen the situation Ms . Noris is facing up , staggered , horrified face : 
- My cat ! 
Oh my cat ! 
What happened to Mrs. Noris this way ? 
The teacher shrieked . His burning eyes clung to Harry . 
Teacher shouted : 
- You ! 
You ! 
You murdered my cat ! 
You killed it ! 
I will kill you ! 
I will 
- Master Filch ! 
Dumbledore appears , interrupting Filch in a cautious manner . 
In a flash , Dumbledore passed Harry , Ron , and Hermione , to the wall , removing Miss Noris from the torch . 
He told Filch : 
- He followed me , Filch . 
And you , Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Brother Lockhart stepped forward , saying : 
- Dear principal , my office is also just upstairs right now , please ask the principal for help 
Dumbledore said : 
- Thank you , Gilderoy . 
The crowd was quietly giving way to Dumbledore and the people involved . 
Lockhart , looking energetic and important , hurriedly followed Dumbledore ; It is followed by Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape . 
Everyone who had just walked into Lockhart's room immediately made a series of moves through the walls . 
Harry saw many Lockhart portraits fluttering out of the light with his head curled up . 
Lockhart literally lit the lamp on the desk and stepped back . 
Dumbledore placed Mrs Noris on the glossy table , beginning to examine the animal . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at each other anxiously and then sat down in chairs beyond the candlelight ; Sit there and look but do not know what to do . 
The tip of Dumbledore's long , curved nose was only about half that of Mrs. Noris . 
He carefully looked at the cat through the glasses half the moon . 
Her long fingers gently poked at the cat . 
Professor McGonagall also leaned close to Mrs. Noris , the professor's eyes narrowed . 
Snape was standing behind them , half dead in the dark , with a strange face : it looked like he was trying his best to stop laughing . 
And Lockhart whirled around , suggesting all this opinion to the other opinion : 
- Certainly there is a curse that killed it . Perhaps the mantra of the Variation of the Virtual Miracle I have seen so many times , unfortunately this time I was not present in time . 
I know of all the curses that can save it 
Lockhart's lies were interrupted by the broken sobs of Mr. Filch . 
He sat down on the chair next to the desk , with his face in his hands , unable to have the courage to look at Miss Noris . 
Although Harry hated the filch supervisor , he felt sorry for him now . 
But how poor teacher can not be equal to the crime itself . 
If Dumbledore believed Filch's words , he would be expelled . 
Dumbledore was whispering strange words as the wand gripped her wand . 
Dumbledore was whispering strange words as he waved his wand at Mrs. Noris , but no miracles were ever going to happen . 
The cat was as motionless as a newly stuffed animal . 
Lockhart : 
- I remember Ouagadogou happened to be something like this . 
A series like this is not one . 
I have full details in my autobiography . 
At that time I gave people in the town of amulets of all kinds , resolving that problem immediately 
Lockhart's portraits on the wall simultaneously nodded as he spoke . 
One of the portraits forgot to lose the job to strip the hair net on his head . 
Finally , Dumbledore straightened up . he said softly : 
- It's not dead yet , Mr. Filch . 
Lockhart stopped midway through the conclusion of the assassination that he had prevented . 
Filch swallowed , watching Noris through her fingers . 
- Not dead ? 
But why is it so stiff like this ? 
Dumbledore said : 
- It is petrified 
Lockhart shouted : 
- that ! 
I thought so ! 
Dumbledore continued : 
- but why can not we talk about stone ? 
Filch turned his face toward Harry and screamed : 
- Ask him that ! 
Dumbledore said , as the nails were tied : 
- No second - year student can do that . 
You need the most advanced Black Magic 
Filch still swollen his face : 
- Do it yourself ! 
That guy is all about it . 
Everyone has seen it on the wall ! 
It was discovered in my office It knew I was I was 
Filch's face looked horrible when he tried to say the last word : 
- He knew I was a Squib ! 
Harry saw that everyone , even Lockhart's portraits , were looking at him . 
She says loudly : 
- I have not touched Mrs. Noris ! 
And you never know what Squib is ? 
Brother Filch growled : 
- Loud ! 
You saw my letter Kwikspell ! 
From the dark , Snape said , 
- Dear principal , if you allow , I would say 
Harry's predilection increased ; It sure is not what Snape said , which brought good to him . 
Snape smirked at his mouth , as if he were very suspicious of it : 
- Potter and friends of the game is just not in the right place at the wrong time . 
But we have some dubious elements here . 
Why are you in the hallway upstairs ? 
Why not Halloween parties ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione simultaneously explain each other about the Hoi An party . 
- There are hundreds of ghosts there . 
They will testify to us that we were there . 
- But why then did not you go to the Hall of Fame ? go up the hallway upstairs to do ? 
Snape snapped back at the children , his glittering black eyes flashing . 
Ron and Hermione looked at Harry . 
- Because Because 
Harry stammered . 
His heart was beating , there was something telling him that no one would believe it was chasing the voice of an invisible man - the only voice he could hear . 
And he said , 
- Because we are too tired to sleep . 
- Do not eat or drink anything ? 
Master Snape's voice was full of sarcasm , a triumphant grin on his face . 
- I do not believe that the party of the children that have the taste of living people . 
Tony's grumble , but he still says aloud : 
- We are not hungry . 
Snape's sarcasm grows louder . 
He said : 
- Dear principal , I think Harry was not completely honest . 
It may be necessary to give up the privileges of the game until it tells us the whole story . 
In my opinion , it should be chased out of the Gryffindor Quidditch team until it is more honest . 
Professor McGonagall fiercely ; 
- Mr. Severus , actually I see no reason to forbid Harry to play Quidditch . 
This cat must be gripped by the grip of the boy's head in the face of this farm . 
There was no evidence that Harry had done anything wrong . 
Dumbledore looked at Harry probe . 
The gleaming blue eyes make Harry feel like he's being radiographed . 
Finished , Dumbledore said firmly : 
- A person is still considered innocent until proven guilty , Mr. Severus . 
Snape looked so angry . 
So is Filch . 
He hissed , his eyes burning : 
- My cat is petrified ! 
I want to see the punishment ! 
Dumbledore patiently said : 
- We can cure the cat , Argus . 
Professor Sprout has recently managed to find some ginseng . 
When the ginseng is large enough , I will make a medicine that can make Mrs. Noris recover . 
Mr. Lockhart jumps in : 
- let me make it ! 
I've done it a hundred times already . 
Even in sleep , I can also practice the Great Ginseng Spirit 
- Sorry . 
Master Snape's voice cold : 
- I thought I was the poison in this school ! 
The room suddenly fell into an awkward silence . 
Dumbledore told Harry , Ron and Hermione : 
- You can go back . 
The children immediately retreated , trying not to shudder , but step as fast as possible . 
Upon reaching the upper floor of Lockhart's office , they pulled into an empty classroom and gently closed all the doors . 
Harry surveyed their faces in the dark : 
- You think I should tell all the teachers about the voice I heard ? 
Ron said without hesitation : 
- do not ! 
Hearing a voice that no one hears is not a good sign , even in the wizarding world . 
Something in Ron's voice makes Harry ask again : 
- You do not believe me ? 
Ron responds quickly : 
- Of course I believe . 
But you have to admit that it is also monstrous 
Harry agrees : 
- I know it's weird . 
But the whole story is monstrous . 
What do the words on the wall say ? 
What is the secret of the secret chamber ? 
Ron said slowly : 
- You know , it reminds me of something . 
I think there is a sentence , someone told me a story about a secret room at Hogwarts school dare to Bill 
Harry remembered : 
- What about Squib ? 
Ron grinned happily at Harry : 
" Oh , there's nothing funny , but that's because it's Mr. Filch who laughs . 
Squib was born into a witch family but did not have any magic abilities . It is the opposite of the witches from the Muggle family . 
But Squib is rare . 
If Filch tried to learn magic through Kwikspell , then I'm sure he was a Squib . This is a great deal . 
Why do you hate our students so badly ? he said that . 
After saying this , Ron laughed again . 
There was a ringing sound from the clock . 
Harry said : 
- Midnight . 
We should go back to the bedroom and find out what Snape caught up with and add to the crime now . 
During the next few days , the school did not discuss anything other than the incestuous Mrs. Noris . 
Filch kept on stirring up the story in his head by stalking at where Mrs. Noris was attacked , as if he thought the man who had done it would come back . 
Harry saw that he was trying to shake off the message on the wall with the Magical Nose Wiping away all of Skower's stuff , but still did not get any results . 
The words glowed brightly on the stone wall . 
When not busy guarding the scene of Mrs. Noris , Filch went around the corridors , lazily kissing each other , grabbing any suspicious pupils for punishment , sometimes for the sake of justice . I like to breathe loudly and cheerfully . 
Ginny Weasley seemed to be thrilled and anxious about Miss Noris's fate . 
According to Ron , she has a lot of cats . 
Ron tries to make her grieve : 
- Because I have never tasted Mrs. Noris . 
Well , to say the least , Miss Noris is a great help to us . 
Ginny's lips quivered , Ron reassured : 
- But at Hogwarts , things like this do not happen very often . 
How can one catch the crazy thing that caused the excuse and kicked him out of school to see it . 
He only asked for that guy to have enough time to cast rocks for Filch before he was expelled . 
Ginny's face was suddenly white . 
Ron hurriedly said : 
- He just joked 
Noris's attack also had an effect on Hermione . 
Previously , she spent a lot of time reading books , but now she is doing nothing more than reading . 
Even when Ron and Harry asked what Hermione was studying , she did not reply . 
Until Wednesday next , they will know . 
That day , Harry was arrested after a class on poison . 
Snape took him by the side to shave off the worms that clung to the table . 
So it's late lunch . 
Hurrying to eat , he runs up Ron's room in the library . 
He saw Justin Finch - Fletchley , the boy of the Hufflepuff family Harry was familiar with in herbal medicine classes , was approaching . 
Harry just opened his mouth to greet Justin , just saw Harry , immediately turned away , and tiptoed as if running in the opposite direction . 
Harry found Ron at the end of the library , pitted against the History of Magic lesson . 
Professor Binns asked each of them to write a nine - minute essay on the subject of the Medieval Conference of the Wizards of Europe . 
Ron said , 
- I can not believe it , but I'm missing eight 
She let go of the parchment , and the paper rolled up . 
Where is Hermione ? 
- But Hermione's essay is a long one , it means it is tiny . 
Harry opened his parchment , picking up the ruler to measure the text he wrote . 
She asked : 
- Where's Hermione ? 
Ron pointed to the bookshelves : 
- Where is it ? is looking for another book . 
I'm sure she reads the library before Christmas . 
Harry tells Ron about Justin avoiding him . 
Ron scribbled , literally like a chicken , so that his essay seemed full of words , saying : 
- Hao knows where you go to worry about that nonsense . 
I told him that a bit dumb . 
To say so little story , how great master Lockhart 
Just then Hermione appeared between the two shelves . 
She looked so ragged , but what appeared to be willing to talk to Harry and Ron . 
She sat down next to Ron and Harry : 
- How many Hogwarts books - a history is all borrowed . 
The waiting list for that book is two weeks long . 
To spend that time I did not leave my book at home . 
But there was no way to tuck it in the chest filled with Lockhart's book . 
Harry asked : 
- What do you need to do ? 
Hermione replies : 
Then there are also others who want to borrow the book : read the myths of the Secret Chamber . 
Harry said quickly : 
- In what say ? 
Hermione bit her lip : 
- Suffering it ! 
I can not remember . 
The other books do not have any books . 
Ron watches the watch , eagerly pleading Hermione : 
- Let me take a look at your essay . 
Hermione suddenly turned serious : 
- No way . 
You have up to ten days to prepare the essay . 
- I just need to add two more to finish , to look a bit 
Ring . 
The dragons in the History of Magic , Ron and Hermione just go out and fight each other . 
History of Magic is the most boring subject in children's timetable . 
The teacher of the subject was Professor Binns , the only teacher of them . 
And the only thing interesting in all of this class was the professor entering the classroom by going through the blackboard . 
Professor Binns has dried up and is extremely ancient , but many say he has not realized he is dead . 
One day , the professor woke up and went to class , leaving his body sitting on the couch in the teacher's room . 
Since then , the style and style of the professor has not changed a bit . 
Today is as boring as ever . 
Professor Binns opened the lesson plan and began to read a tedious , tedious voice that sounded like the hiss of an old vacuum cleaner until everyone in the class drowned in sleep , occasionally waking up to write Copy a name or a timeline , then fall back to sleep . 
The professor read about half an hour , something that had never happened before : Hermione raised her hand to speak . 
In the midst of a deadly lecture at the International Warlock Conference in 1289 , the professor glanced , aware of Hermione's raised arm , 
- Game 
" Professor , my name is Hermione . 
I wonder if the professor can tell us something about the Secret Chamber ? 
Hermione's voice was very clear . 
Dean Thomas was staring out the window , suddenly realizing his dream . 
Lavender Brown bent his head from his arms around the table , and Neville slipped off his elbow off the table . 
Professor Binns blinked . 
He spoke in a dry voice : 
- Our history is the History of Magic , Hermione . 
What I teach is facts , but I do not teach myths or myths . 
The professor cleared his ears as if the chalk was broken and then continued : 
What's that Hermione ? 
- In September of that year , a sub committee of Sardinian witches 
But the professor just stammered a few words to stop : Hermione's hand waved in the air . 
- What's that Hermione ? 
" Professor , is not legend somehow based on a certain event ? 
Professor Binns looked at Hermione with such amazement that Harry believed that there would never have been a student ever to stop Professor Binns lecture , whether he was alive or dead . 
Slowly Professor voice : 
- Ah , yes . 
I think some people think so , 
Then he stared at Hermione as if this was the first time he saw a true student : 
- However , the myth that the game is just a sensational , even ridiculous story . 
The class is now listening to Prof . Binns . 
The professor glanced blindly , seeing every face looking up at him . 
Harry dared to be a professor completely unexpected before an unusually interesting spectacle . 
He said quietly : 
- Okay , okay . Remember the Confidential Chamber ? The lessons must have known , Hogwarts Academy was the four greatest trilogy of ancient times established a thousand years ago . Exactly what day is unknown . Four dormitory in the school Today is named after the four : Godric Gryffindor , Helga Hufflepuff , Rowena Ravenclaw , and Salazar Slytherin . 
Together they built this mansion , hidden away from the Muggle gaze , because at that time ordinary people were still afraid of mysterious magic , and witches at that time often suffered much persecution . . 
The professor stopped , turned his dim eyes around the room , and continued : 
In the first few years , the founders worked together in harmony , searching for talented young men to take to the castle . 
But then they gradually arise contradictions . 
Between Slytherin and others there is an ever - widening rift . 
Slytherin wants to make the selection of young witches into Hogwarts more tightly . 
He suggested that witches should be taught only to pure - blooded wizarding families . 
He does not like to adopt Muggle children , because they are unreliable . 
Some time later , there is a heated debate on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor , and Slytherin eventually leaves school . 
Professor Binns stopped speaking , though his lips looked like an old tortoise : 
- Reliable sources tell us a lot of authentic evidence . 
But these truthful events have been obscured by an oddly legendary Secret Chamber . 
It was rumored that Slytherin had built a secret chamber in the castle , which the other co - founders did not know at all . 
According to legend , Slytherin had concocted the secret room , so that no one could open it , until Slytherin's true successor arrived . 
The new Successor alone can open the Chamber of Secrets , releasing the horror hidden inside , to purge all those who do not deserve to learn magic . 
When the story ends , the class is silent as a sheet ; but not as silly as the days of Prof . Binns . 
Something very upset was floating in the air as the children looked up at Professor Binns , waiting for the professor to say something else . 
Professor Binns was a little annoyed : 
- Of course , the whole story is very crap . 
The fact is that the school has repeatedly sent the most learned sorcerers to look for evidence of a secret room like that . 
But that room did not exist . 
It's just a story to scare the fools . 
Hermione's hand jumps up into the air : 
" Teacher , what exactly is the so - called terror inside the secret room , what is it ? 
Still in a dry voice , Professor Binns said : 
It is believed that inside the secret room , there is a monster that can only be controlled by the Slytherin Successor . 
The class looked at each other worriedly . 
Professor Binns arranges his textbooks , adding : 
- I said already , that did not exist . 
There is not a Chamber of Secrets and no monster at all . 
Seamus said , 
" But , Master , if the Chamber of Secrets can only be opened by the Slytherin Successor itself , then who else can open it , do not you ? 
The professor was overly disturbed : 
- Nonsense , bullshit . 
If so many successors of Hogwarts do not find anything 
Parvati's mouth : 
- But , sir , sometimes the dark magic must be used 
Professor Binns : 
- People do not want to use Dark Arts , not people do not know where to use , game Xu Hollow . 
I repeat , if someone like Dumbledore 
Dean Thomas is not alone : 
" But maybe the open man must have something to do with Slytherin , but Dumbledore is not 
The professor seemed overwhelmed , so coldly replied : 
- Okay enough ! that's just a legend ! 
Does not exist . 
There is little evidence that Slytherin ever built something like a secret siphon to broom , let alone a secret room ! 
I regret to tell the story to hear a stupid story ! 
We will come back , if you please , to the lesson of history , with certain facts that are certain , verifiable , and trustworthy ! 
So within five minutes , the whole class was immersed in a state of slumber , as if from the past . 
At the end of the class , Ron , Harry and Hermione joined the crowded student corridor to run to the bedroom , threw the pair down the bed before running down the dining hall . 
Ron told the two of them : 
- I still know now Salazar Slytherin is a crazy monster , but I did not know that he initiated the pureblood . 
You have not paid for your money in the house . 
To tell you the truth , if the helmet classified me in the Slytherin , I would rather wrap up on the train to go home . 
Hermione nodded approvingly , but Harry did not say anything . 
His stomach just crouched a very uncomfortable . 
He had never told Ron and Hermione that the classified hat had seriously weighed whether to place it in the Slytherin house . 
It still remembers , just like yesterday , the soft voice whispered in his ear as he placed the hat on his head , more than a year ago : 
To be great , you know , in my head there is already everything , and Slytherin will help me become great , sure enough . 
But Harry , who had once heard of the Slytherin reputation as the one to train the darkest sorcerers , thought so earnestly : do not be Slytherin ! . 
And the hat said : No ? Well , if you were definitely better than Gryffindor . 
Hi , Harry ! 
The three of them were swept away in the crowd , meeting Colin Creevy . 
- Hi , Harry ! 
Harry responds mechanically : 
- Hi , Colin ! 
The boy pursued Harry with a frown : 
" You know , Harry , there is one in my class that says you 
But the kid was too small to resist the crowded crowd in the Hall ; Harry just heard the boy scream : 
- See you , Harry ! 
Then the boy went missing . 
Hermione wondered : 
- Do not know what somebody in the class said ? 
Brother Harry clawed again as he remembered how Justin was fuming at noon . 
It says : 
- I guess we're the Slytherin Successor ! 
Ron shows resentment : 
- What are you here to believe ? 
The crowd stretched , and the three of them climbed up the next staircase without too much difficulty . 
Ron asked Hermione again : 
- According to you , the Chamber of Secrets is real ? 
Hermione shuddered : 
- I do not know . Dumbledore did not save Mrs. Noris , which made her think that the attacker , Mrs. Noris , whoever she was , was not human . 
Speaking of which , she turned around and realized that all three were at the end of the corridor where the disaster had taken place . 
They stood up and looked at each other . 
The scene is still the same as the night of the Mausoleum , but there is no hardened cat hung upside down on the torch , and an empty seat has been laid against the stone wall carrying the message of the Secret Chamber . was opened . 
Ron whispered : 
- The chair is to let Mr. Filch sit there . 
Harry said : 
- Trying to look around here probably does not hurt either . 
She dropped her briefcase , crawled along the corridor to find clues . 
It says : 
- There are scorching marks here and there 
Cried Hermione . 
- Come here and look at this ! 
This is funny 
Harry stood up and ran to the window beside the message on the wall . 
Hermione was pointing at the top of the glass , where there were about twenty dozen spiders on the run , clearly clutching through a small crevice . 
A silver thread and long bowed down like a rope , it seemed as if all the spiders had climbed with that rope in the rush out . 
Hermione wondered : 
- Do you see spiders acting like that ? 
Harry said : 
- Not yet . 
Do you see Ron ? Ron ? Ron ? 
Harry looked over his shoulder . 
Ron was standing in the distance , seemingly trying to keep himself from running away . 
Surprised Harry : 
- What is this ? 
Ron said tensely : 
- I do not like spiders . 
Hermione turned to Ron with astonishment : 
- I did not expect it ! 
How many times do you usually use spiders in a poison course ? 
Ron kept his eye on the window , not daring to look away . 
It says : 
- I'm not tired of the dead . 
I just do not like the way they crawled around 
Hermione giggled . 
Ron : 
- What's so funny ? 
You have to know that when I was three years old , Fred turned his teddy bear into a huge , ugly spider , just because I broke the toy broom of the photo . , when you are holding a teddy bear tightly , suddenly it grows a whole bunch of legs wiggle 
She dropped the sentence , shivering . 
Hermione is clearly still trying to hold back her laughter . 
Harry felt no need to spin the subject again , he said : 
- Do you still remember the puddle on the floor ? 
I do not know that puddle for a long time . 
Someone has already wiped it . 
Ron managed to take control , stepping a few feet past Filch's chair , pointing to the floor : 
- It's around here . 
Screw that door . 
He reached the door , twisted his bronze fist , but suddenly jumped up , as if his hand was burned . 
Harry asked : 
- What's up ? 
Said Ron , 
- Not possible . 
Women toilet . 
Hermione stood up and went close : 
- Oh , that's fine , Ron . no one in there . 
The toilet was where the ghost was crying , Myrtle . 
We do not try to try . 
So despite the fact that the sign of the word was DEMONSTRATOR , Hermione pushed on the door . It was the darkest toilet that Harry had ever set foot in . 
Underneath a large glass , cracked , patchy , are the chip wash hand . 
The floor is damp and shimmering light of the burning candles near the lampstand . 
The wooden door of the toilet is abrasive , long nails , there is a hinge removed only lax . 
Hermione put her finger on her lips , then went to the last chamber . 
Upon arriving , she said , 
This is a female toilet . 
Where are the women ? 
- Good morning my lady , how are you ? 
Harry and Ron also came close to see . 
The crying Myrtle floats above the spillway of the toilet , trying to squeeze a pimple under his chin . 
He looked at Harry and Ron with suspicious eyes : 
- this is a female toilet . 
Do not we girls now ? 
Hermione agrees : 
- right . 
They are not women . 
I just want to introduce them to this beautiful place like that . 
The ghost waved vaguely toward the dirty old mirror and the wet floor . 
Harry looked at Hermione , 
- Asked if she saw something ? 
Myrtle glared at Harry . 
- What are you small ? 
- Nothing ? 
Harry refused . 
- We just want to ask 
Myrtle cringed as if about to burst out crying . 
- I hope people do not talk to me again . 
You know , I have feelings too , even if I'm dead . 
Hermione explained : 
- Myrtle , no one wants to provoke me . 
Harry just 
Myrtle roared : 
- No one wants to provoke me ? 
Listen up ! My life is nothing more than a series of mourning rug in the corridors . 
Now they fly to ruin my life . 
Hermione said quickly : 
- We just want to ask you to see something funny recently ? 
Because there was a spit cats right outside the door of the sanctuary in the Mausoleum . 
Harry asked , 
- that night , do you see anything near here ? 
Myrtle suddenly interrupted : 
- I do not mind ! 
Peeves teased me so much that I left here to find my own death . 
But then I remember what I did 
Ron added : 
- already dead . 
Myrtle burst into tears , raised on high , turned , and dashed down , bending over the toilet bowl , splashing water all around , and disappearing . 
However , based on the creeping sob of the ghost , it can be determined that it has rested somewhere on the U - shaped pipe . 
Harry and Ron watched and gasped . 
But Hermione shrugged and said , 
- That's right , that way also made Myrtle a little happy . Well , let's go . 
Harry did not close the door of the female toilet again , the croaking sobbing of the crying ghost was crushed immediately by a thunderous shout : 
- RON ! 
Leader Percy is standing right at the top of the stairs , his head flashed bright , his face still horrible : 
- that is the female toilet ! 
Why do you 
Ron shrugged . 
- I just looked over , you know , we are looking for clues 
Percy's eyes widened as Harry remembered Mrs. Weasley . 
go - go - go - go - go - go ! 
Percy strode towards the children , arms fluttering , pacing them along the corridor . 
- Do not you mind what this looks like ? 
While everyone is having dinner , we fly back here 
Ron rebuked , interrupted Percy's voice and scowled at him : 
- Why should not we be here ? 
I heard it clearly : they did not even reach for a finger to touch that cat ! 
Percy boiled the liver : 
" You told Ginny that way , but it kept worrying that I was about to be expelled . 
He had never seen Ginny worry so much . 
Crying to swollen eyes . 
You have to think of it a bit . 
All freshmen are pressing for this case . 
Ron spat again , his face was red to the ear . 
- He did not think about Ginny . 
I just worried that I was breaking the ruin of the opportunity to win the title of the boys only 
Percy snapped his thumb up the badge , saying harshly : 
- Except Gryffindor five points . 
And I hope that teaches you a lesson ! 
Do souls , do not play detective stories anymore , otherwise he will write the letter cheeks ! 
Finished , Percy left , and his neck was flushed up like Ron's ear . 
That night , in the common room , Harry , Ron and Hermione tried to dodge Percy as far away as possible . 
Ron was still warm , so he squeezed his spell on his charms . 
As Ron absently waved his wand to remove the stain , it burned into the parchment . Fuming no less than the exercise of it , Ron closed the book immediately curse Book basic , 2 nd grade . 
Harry is surprised to see Hermione also imitate . 
She said in a soft voice , as if continuing the story they had been talking about so far . 
- But who can get it ? 
Who wants to threaten to dismiss all Squib or Muggle from Hogwarts ? 
Ron made a hunch : 
- Try it ! 
Do we have any kids who think Muggle origin is a scum ? 
He looked at Hermione , Hermione looked at him , not quite sure : 
- If you're referring to Malfoy 
- I'm talking about him , but nothing else . 
Do not you hear him ? - Next will be you , Blood Mud ! - To think , you just look at the mice face it is far enough know that it is it ! 
Hermione was still skeptical : 
- Malfoy , is it Slytherin's heir ? 
To this country , Harry also folded his book , contributed : 
- Look at the family try it . 
It all came from Slytherin , it always brags about it . 
It may very well be the descendant of Slytherin . 
It alone is poisonous enough ! 
Said Ron : 
- Even though they have had the key to open the door of the Secret Chamber for hundreds of years , and passed on to generations , from father to son , to grandchildren 
Hermione said hesitantly : 
- Oh , I think too dare 
Harry pessimistic : 
- But how can you prove that it is ? 
Hermione lowered her voice , glancing toward Percy's room , slowly speaking : 
- I think there is a way , but of course it will be difficult . 
And dangerous , very dangerous . 
I'm afraid we will have to violate the fifty things in the rules 
Ron snapped : 
- Then about a month or so , waiting for you to feel that you want to explain then sure you are at this time please tell us , hu ? 
Hermione still beeps : 
- Okay . What we needed to do was go into the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy some questions , but not let him recognize us . 
Both Ron and Harry laughed : 
- But that is impossible . 
- okay ! 
Hermione asserted : 
- What we need is only the drug translation . 
Ron and Harry asked : 
- What ? 
- A few weeks ago Snape talked about it in the classroom 
Ron : 
- What do you think of the poisoned classmates , we have nothing better to do than listen to what Snape said ? 
- it is the medicine that makes me drink , deformed into another person . 
You think ? 
We can turn into three Slytherins . 
No one will know it's us . 
Malfoy might tell us everything . 
Maybe now it's bragging in the Slytherin common room , if only we could hear it . 
Ron looked hesitant : 
- These pills are quite good . 
Unfortunately , we turned into three Slytherins forever ? 
Hermione fluttered impatiently : 
- The drug will be effective in a short time . 
The problem is to find recipes for the new drug is difficult . 
Mr. Snape said that the formula was in a book entitled Effective Dark Drugs , which was in the Restricted area of ​​ the library . 
There is only one way to borrow a book in the Restricted Area : there must be a paper signed by a teacher to read . 
Said Ron : 
- It is difficult to explain to the ears that we need to read the book to do something , if not to try to make one of the toxic drugs in the book . 
Hermione said : 
- I think if I pretend to be the only theoretical interest , maybe not ? 
Said Ron : 
- Come on , let's go , no teachers do not catch that trap . 
They are not stupid 
Chapter 10 : BLUDGER TAI 
Since the catastrophic accident with the little darlings , Professor Lockhart stopped bringing the animals into the classroom . 
Instead , the vegetarian teacher reads the passage in his book to the students who hear , sometimes acting out a little more for the impression . 
He often asked Harry to help him in re - enacting the story in the book . 
Up until now , Harry has been captured as a Transylvanian villager who was saved by Lockhart from the Curse of the Buffy , a cold snowman , and a dragon ghost who could not eat anything other than onion . was treated by Mr. Lockhart . 
During the Black Hawk Art Lesson , Harry was dragged to the theater , this time being played as a werewolf . 
If Harry did not deliberately plead with Lockhart that day , he would have denied this . 
- Tru grow up to be really big , Harry ! right ! 
So , the information is not , I jumped like this throw it to the floor a bag ! So with one hand , I held it tight on the floor . 
And on the other hand , I put the wand into his throat . Then I gathered all my strength to make a very complicated spell , and it was difficult to cast Homorphus . He uttered a groan , moaning , Harry raising his voice . more good ! The feather disappeared its canines , and it returned to human form . Simple , but extremely effective And another village will forever remember me as a hero , who helped them escape the horror of being attacked by wolves every month . 
The bell rang and Lockhart stood up . 
- Homework : Make a poem about my victory over Wagga Wagga ! 
The best will be rewarded with an autobiographical autobiography . 
The class begins to beat the door . 
Harry turned to the back of the room where Ron and Hermione were waiting . 
Harry whispered : 
- Ready ? 
Hermione worried : 
- Wait for everyone to come out . OK 
She approached Lockhart's desk , holding a paper , Harry and Ron standing behind Hermione . 
- Dear Professor Lockhart ! 
I want to borrow this book from the library , just to read it again . 
But because the book is in the Restricted Area , I need a teacher's signature on this readable paper . 
She held the paper out , her hands trembling : 
- I'm sure this book will help you understand more about what you write about snake venom - slow - in the book Wander with the Vampire 
- Ah , wander with the vampires ! 
Lockhart smiled brightly at Hermione , taking the paper she had taken . 
- Can say that is the book I like most . 
Read or not ? 
Hermione fervently : 
- Yes , read it . 
The way that he traps his last child with a tea bag is clever 
- Good . 
You certainly will not mind that you reward the best students during the school year with a little extra support . 
Master enthusiastically draws t enthusiastically drawn from the great feathered poet , slightly misunderstood look on his face Ron : 
- Oh , nice pen ? 
I just wanted to sign the book . 
Saying , he whispered a signature circle around the sow on the paper and allowed to return to Hermione . 
While Hermione folded the paper with her trembling fingers and stuffed it in her bag , Lockhart turned to Harry : 
- Why , Harry ? 
Tomorrow is the first Quidditch match of the season , right ? Team Gryffindor plays against Slytherin , right ? 
Did you hear that the game was a very good player ? 
In the past , he was also a Hacker . 
He was recruited into the National Sports Team , but he wanted to devote himself to the cause of the Dark Ages . 
Anyway , whenever you feel you need to train yourself , just keep talking to me , do not be shy . 
He is always willing to share his intelligence to the less able 
Harry hummed something in his throat and hurriedly followed Ron and Hermione . 
When the three of them checked the license , Harry said , 
- I can not believe it ! 
You do not even look at the title of the book we want to borrow . 
Said Ron : 
- Because he is frivolous skull . 
But whoever cares about that , as long as you have what you need 
Then they ran toward the library , Hermione running both against the thé : 
- You are not a skull . 
- Oh , the teacher said you are the best student of the year 
They had come to the library at that time , so they had to lower their voices in the silence of this place . 
Ms . Pince , the librarian , is a skinny , irritated woman who looks like a malnourished vulture . 
She read the title with suspicion : 
- effective dark poison . 
She intended to confiscate the license in Hermione's hands , but she certainly did not let go , saying excitedly : 
- Do not know if you can keep the paper ? 
Ron took the paper out of Hermione's hand , handed it to Mrs. Pince : 
- Well , let's go , we ' ll get another signature . 
Lockhart was willing to sign anything as long as he did not move to sign . 
Pince took the paper out to the place where the light was , as if determined to detect fake . 
However , the paper finally passed the test . 
She walks between tall bookshelves and later returns with a big book . 
Hermione carefully tucked the book into her bag , and then they all came out , trying not to step too fast or show off guilty . 
Five minutes later , they were entombed in the corridors of Myrtle's crying mausoleum . 
Hermione brushed off Ron's argument , arguing that it was the place where no one thought about visiting , and so they assured that no one would be disturbed . 
Myrtle crying in the toilet , but the children are wearing ghosts , and the ghost also wear the children . 
Hermione carefully opened her dark potions , and all three of them read 
Hermione carefully opened the dark potion . As a matter of fact , all three of them read the damp pages . 
At first glance , it is enough to understand why this book is in the Restricted Area : some drugs have such terrible effects that they are unimaginable ; Very hideous , for example , a man who seems to be left flushed from the inside out and a witch surpasses several pairs of leeches on his head . 
When they reached the page entitled Pandemic Flu , Hermione shouted : 
- Here is it ! 
The book is illustrated with pictures of people who are transforming halfway through . 
Harry sincerely hopes that the pain expressed on the faces of those who are transforming is only imagined by the painter . 
Both the detector formula , raw materials , the same processing . 
Hermione murmured , fingering her finger along the list of ingredients : 
- this is the most complicated drug I have ever seen . 
Which are thin wing fly , leeches , seaweed , grass slightly chit . 
Anyway , these items are also easy to find , they are available in the store of study materials of the students , you can get Ui , look , the horn of flour mixture of code - do not know where to find things This is a shag of a snake . It will be very troublesome , of course there must be a little something of the person you want to turn into . 
Asked Ron : 
- What ? 
Sorry , you said a little something of the person you want to turn into is what meaning ? 
I will not drink anything that has Crabbe's toenails in it ! 
Hermione continued as if she had not heard Ron say anything : 
- Now I do not need to worry about it , because it is added at the last stage 
Ron could not speak , turning to look at Harry . 
Harry is also anxious about another : 
- Hermione , do you think we ' ll have to steal so many things ? 
Shreds of a snake , this is not in the stock of student materials ? 
What are we going to do ? 
Could it be Snape's own in - store ? 
I'm not sure about this idea , Hermione . 
Hermione pressed the book hard . 
- Okay , if you stabbed me to death . 
Her cheeks were blushed and her eyes were brighter than usual . 
- You know you do not want to violate the rules . 
But I think threatening Muggle - born people is much worse than producing a hard - to - kill drug . 
But if you do not want to find out if it is Malfoy , then I will go straight to see Mrs. Pince now to return the book . 
Said Ron : 
- I never imagined that one day we were upset this violates the rules . 
All right , we ' ll work together . 
But do not play your nails ! 
Hermione opened her book , her expression happier . 
Harry asked : 
- How long do you think the new drug finished processing ? 
- to calculate , because the seaweed must be picked on the full moon night , and the wing flies must be stewed for twenty - one days I can say within a month is finished processing the drug if you have enough raw materials . 
Asked Ron . 
- One month ? 
By then , Malfoy would probably have gobbled up half of Hogwarts ' Muggle - born students . 
Hermione's eyes narrowed in a scary way , causing Ron to say : 
- But this is the best plan we've ever figured out . 
So , I say , the whole team will work out of gas ! 
However , as Hermione poked her head out of the restroom to investigate the situation for both of them , Ron whispered to Harry privately : 
- I find life is going to be very troublesome if tomorrow's guy Malfoy fall out of his broom for it . 
On Saturday morning , Harry woke up early but lay awake for a moment to think about the upcoming Quidditch match . 
He was worried , partly because he did not know what Wood would say if the Gryffindor team lost , partly because of the prospect of facing a team of players who had the quickest broomsticks and had to buy gold . 
It never had the urge to defeat Slytherin as it is now . 
After half an hour lying there listening to the inside of his liver , he sat up , changed clothes , went down to eat breakfast early . 
By the Great Hall , he meets the Gryffindor squad sitting on an empty long table , who looks tense and does not speak much . 
By eleven o ' clock , the school started pulling out to Quidditch . 
It was a hot day and there were some signs of a thunderstorm . 
Ron and Hermione rushed to the bridge to wish him good luck before he walked into the dressing room . 
The team had worn Gryffindor's bright purple Quidditch uniform , sitting down listening to Wood's pre - match posture . 
He started : 
- Slytherin has a better brush than us . can not deny it . 
But on our broomsticks are better people than they are . 
We have practiced diligently over them , we have been flying in all kinds of weather 
George Weasley murmured : 
- Right . 
I have not been in the right place since August . 
" And we ' ll make them regret the day they let that dreadlip go , Malfoy , get his place in Slytherin . " 
Wood swirled emotionally , Wood turned to Harry : 
- Harry , the end will depend on you , you will have to prove to them that a player needs to have other talents , not just a wealthy father is . 
Capture the Snitch before Malfoy does it , do die trying too , Harry , because today we have to win , we have to win . 
Fred winked at Harry : 
- Then do not worry too much Harry ! 
The two did exactly as she told them , but when they shook hands , he gave the other a glare 
When the whole team came out , the sound came to the hulking greeting : mostly the cheers , because both Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were eager for Slytherin to lose . 
But the Slytherins on the stands were also yelling , whistling for the Gryffindor spirit . 
Hooch , a Quidditch teacher , asked the two captains to shake hands . 
The two did exactly as she told them , but when they shook hands , he threw the threatening glare at the other , and they squeezed each other's arms too tightly . 
Ms . Hooch said : 
- Hear my whistle , three two 
With the growl of the crowd , fourteen players jumped into the gray sky . 
Harry flew higher than all , looking everywhere to find the Snitch . 
Underneath Harry is Malfoy , who also jumps up to show off his new broom . 
Malfoy shouted . 
- Well , head - scars ? 
Harry did not have time to answer . At that moment , a heavy black bludger ran towards Harry ; It was avoided in the interstices of the hair , so the ball was so close that it felt the hair grow up as the ball passed . 
George called : 
- Harry , close to the ribs ! 
He flashed across Harry , his staff ready to bring the Bludger back to Slytherin . 
Harry sees George blowing a bludger at Adrian Pucey , but the Bludger swings midway through the air , then turns to Harry and rushes forward . 
Harry drops himself quickly to avoid the ball , and George tries to hit him hard against Malfoy . 
Once again , the Bludger left Dudley flying like an Aboriginal boomerang , turning around to Harry's head . 
Harry speed up the maximum , leaping to the other end of the stadium . 
He could still hear the Bludger's voice tearing the wind behind him . 
What's up ? Bludger never focused on a player like this . 
Bludger's mission is to try to knock down as many players as possible 
Fred Weasley is waiting for the Bludger at the other end of the stadium . 
When Fred put his best into the Bludger , Harry ducked . 
Bludger was punched out of the field . 
Fred happily called Harry : 
- Done ! 
But he was wrong . 
As if drawn by a magnet , the Bludger resonated with a blow to Harry , and once again , Harry had only flushed with flags . 
It began to rain . 
Harry felt the heavy raindrops fall down on his face , splashing on his lenses . 
It was not possible to know what the match was , until I heard Lee Jordan , the Quidditch commentator , told me : 
- Slytherin lead in , 60 - 0 . 
The superior broom of the Slytherin team is working to their detriment . At the same time , the mad Bludger manages to overwhelm Harry in the air . 
Fred and George are now so close to Harry , so close that Harry can not see anything except their swinging arm . 
It has no chance of finding the Snitch , let alone catch it . 
Fred growled : 
- Someone harassed this Bludger . 
He whips his stick to the Bludger as he plunges into a new attack on Harry . 
George says : 
- We need to pause the game for a moment . 
He tried to signal to Wood , at the same time block the Bludger to stroke Harry's nose . 
Qood is obviously getting the message of George . 
Hooch blew the whistle , and Harry , Fred , and George landed together while the mad Bludger was not released . 
The Gryffindor team reunited , while the Slytherins on the playground stalled . 
Wood asked : 
- What's up ? We are crushed . 
Fred , George , where are you two now when the Bludger is blocking Angeline for a goal ? 
George replied , 
- We were at the height of his friend's seven feet , and were busy fighting back the Bludger to stop him from assassinating Harry . 
Someone took it - It did not go down Harry . 
Since the beginning of the match , it did not chase anyone else . 
The Slytherins would have done it . 
Wood said anxiously : 
- But the two Bludgers have been locked in Ms . Hooch's room since the last training to date . 
At that time , the balls did not have anything . 
Hooch was walking towards them . 
Through her shoulder , Harry could see the Slytherins booing and pointing at it . 
While Hooch did not arrive , Harry promptly said : 
- Please listen to me . 
The two of you who fly around like you always have only the only opportunity for you to catch the Snitch is that it flies in your sleeve only . 
The two of you go back to the team , let me deal with the devil Bludger . 
Fred said , 
- do not be stupid . 
I like to scratch your head like a play . 
Wood looked at Harry to see the Weasley brothers . 
Alicia said angrily : 
- Mr. Wood , this is crazy . 
He could not let Harry alone handle the mad Bludger . 
You must ask for an investigation 
Harry said : 
- If we stop the game then we lose ! 
And we can not lose to Slytherin just because a Bludger is crazy ! 
Mr. Wood , please tell them to let alone handle it . 
George immediately told Wood : 
- this is my fault , Mr. Wood . Having died trying too hard , he told him something stupid ! 
Hooch came to them . 
She asked Wood : 
- Ready to resume the game ? 
Wood looked at Harry's determined eyes , saying : 
- OK . 
Fred , George , you both heard Harry say it - Just leave it alone with the Bludger . 
The rain is still falling , but it's still heavier now . 
Hooch's whistle sounded , Harry jumped into the air , listening to the howling of the crazy Bludger left behind . 
Harry rose higher and higher . 
It flipped the cat , suddenly swooping down and suddenly spiral up , spiral in shape , zigzag zigzag winding , sometimes rolling like wheels . 
Despite his dizziness , he still tried to open his eyes . 
The rain smudged the entire glass , flowing in its nose as it headed down to the ground , reaching up to the sky , trying to avoid a fierce attack from the Bludger . 
He heard laughter rising from the stands ; He knows it looks like a crazy guy , but he knows the devil Bludger because he is so heavy that he can not turn around as fast as he can . 
It started a game around the stadium with the Bludger , no other than a roller coaster ride , with sudden turns , unbending breaks . At the same time , it still glanced through the rain , towards the posts of Gryffindor , where Adrian Pucey is trying to overcome Wood . 
Bludger again rushed to Harry , the wind soared to his ears to know it just escaped narrowly . 
He turned his head , turned and ran away . 
It started the game around the stadium with the Bludger , no different than the roller coaster ride 
- Hey , Harry ! 
Are you doing ballet ? 
Malfoy screamed , while Harry tried to make a cataclysmic flicker in the middle of the air to avoid another blow of the Bludger , then fumbled with the Bludger still clinging to it , less than a meter behind . back . 
But at that moment , when Harry gave Malfoy a hateful look , Harry saw it - the yellow Snitch . 
It hovered over Malfoy's left ear just a few inches away , but Malfoy was busy laughing at Harry so he did not see it ! 
In a moment of stupefaction , Harry stood in the middle of the sky , not daring to run towards Malfoy , only to be afraid of him , but raised his head to see the golden Snitch . 
HAPPY ! ! ! 
Its immobile seconds are too long . 
The Bludger finally reaches his target : slamming a saber into Harry , banging his elbows , and Harry realizes his arm has broken . 
Stunned and aching , Harry fell on the rain broom , with only one knee trying to bend his broom , his arm swinging uselessly against his side . 
The Bludger still does not give up , is back again to beat another hit , this time in front of Harry . 
He was out of the balloon's path , in his numb head with only one thought , clear , certain : clinging to Malfoy . 
Despite the torrential rain and boredom , Harry fumbled to his lofty face with a contemptuous smile on his face and recognized the eyes of terror on his face : Malfoy thought Harry was crazy to turn around . public it . 
- What game ? 
Malfoy jumped out of Harry's flight , while Harry hurriedly lowered his injured hand from his broomstick , shooting hard . 
He felt his fingers reach the frozen Yellow Snitch , while the two legs struggled to grab the brush . the crowd screeched to the ground , and Harry slammed to the ground , trying his best not to faint . 
A thud sounded with the mud splashing , broomstick stick plugs , and Harry flipped several cats on the ground after splashing off the brush . 
Her broken arm crumpled up and looked very weird . 
Harry was still shocked , as if echoing from distant lands , with many whistling screams . 
But it only focused on the left Snitch gold grasp in the broken hand . 
A ha ! 
We won ! 
He whispered : 
- ha ! 
We won . 
Fainted 
As Harry woke up , the rain was still falling on his face , and it was still lying on the ground . 
Someone was bending over , and Harry saw his sparkling white teeth . 
It moan : 
- Oh , it's me 
Lockhart shouted out loudly to the crowd : 
- She does not know what she is saying . Do not worry , Harry . 
I will heal my arm . 
- do not . 
Harry screamed : 
- Thank you , I want to leave it like this 
He tried to sit up , but the pain was in the blue . 
Suddenly heard a familiar separation somewhere near , Harry shouted loudly : 
- Colin , I do not want to take this picture . 
Mr. Lockhart said gently : 
- Lie down baby . 
To cast this spell simply , he did not know how many times already 
Harry gritted his teeth : 
- Why not take your child to hospital ? 
Wood agrees : 
" Sir , it is true that Harry should go to bed . 
Wood is muddy , and although the rivals of the home team are injured , Wood can not help but smile : 
- Harry , I caught the ball very well . 
A great shot , very spectacular , my best shot , he dared say so 
Through his thick , hardened legs , Harry was able to see Fred and George struggling to stuff the Bludger in a box . 
That was a fierce fight . 
Lockhart rolled his sleeves into a sapphire green slap , shouting at the crowd : 
- Back ! 
- Oh , no . 
Please do not 
Harry struggled weakly ; but Lockhart was dancing his wand , and immediately afterwards , he pointed the wand directly to Harry's arm . 
A strange and uncomfortable feeling rang from Harry's shoulders down to the tip of his fingers . 
It feels like the arm is stretched out slightly . 
Harry did not have enough courage to look down at what had happened . 
He still closed his eyes , turning his face away . 
But seeing the crowd gaping and Colin suddenly shoots like crazy , Harry realizes the worst scary thing to have happened : Harry's arm is no longer painful , but at the same time it no longer looks What is an arm ? 
Brother Lockhart exclaimed : 
- Reason ? 
Oh , no problem . 
Occasional trouble is common . 
But the bottom line is that the bones are no longer broken . That is something to keep in mind . 
Oh , Harry , go slowly to the sickness . 
Ron , Ron and Hermione , two games to play offline . 
Mrs Pomfrey would be able to do a little trimming . 
When Harry got up , it felt very strange . 
He took a deep breath to have the courage to look down at his right hip . 
And what he saw nearly knocked him down one more time : 
Protruding under its sleeve is something that looks like a thick rubber glove , human skin color . 
He tried to move his finger . 
But no need to move . 
Lockhart turned out not to bind his bones , but simply pulled his arm bone away . 
Mrs. Pomfrey , of course , was not satisfied . 
She was angry at the sad , unsettled remnants of what half an hour ago was Harry's good arm , shouting : 
- You should come to see me right away ! 
I can connect the bone for a second , but the bone grows back 
Harry desperately : 
- You can do it , right ? 
Mrs. Pomfrey threw Harry the patient's suit , saying gently : 
- Of course I can do it . 
But it was very painful . 
You have to stay sick tonight 
Hermione was waiting outside the curtain around Harry's bed , while Ron helped Harry change his clothes . 
It takes a lot of time to insert so - called soft boneless rubber arms . 
From within the curtain , Ron pulled Harry's swirly fingers over his sleeve , saying , 
- Why , Hermione ? 
Are you kidding Lockhart now ? 
Harry , who needs to remove the bone , asked him . 
Hermione said : 
- Anyone can have a mistake . 
By the way , the arm is gone , is not it , Harry ? 
Harry to bed : 
- Ừ . 
Out of pain . 
But also used up . 
When he fell on his bed , his arm swung down unintentionally . 
Hermione and Pomfrey walked around the curtain . 
Mrs. Pomfrey holds a large bottle containing something labeled Moffat ( originally : Skele - Gro , or Skeleton's insufficient write - Growth ) . 
She poured the smoke into a cup , handed it to Harry and said : 
- This evening will be on . 
Rebirth of bone is not very interesting . 
Harry closed his eyes and drank the marmalade . 
It burned both Harry's lips and throat on the way down to his belly , causing Harry to cough and sneeze . 
Pomfrey repeatedly shook her head to express her opinion about dangerous sports and incompetent teachers . 
Finally , she retreated , leaving Ron and Hermione behind to help Harry swallow more sips of water through the throat . 
Said Ron , with a grin . 
- Anyway , we also won . 
You caught the ball really run out . 
Must see Malfoy's face It looks like he wants to eat you alive . 
Hermione looked worried : 
- I want to know how it can be re - bludger . 
Harry rubbed his head against the pillow and said , 
- We add that sentence to the list of questions we will ask it when we take the drug to translate the picture . 
I pray that it will be better than this marmalade . 
Said Ron : 
- You say play , that multi - fluid is a bit of the Slytherin that delicious ? 
At that time the door of the hospital was open . 
All the other Gryffindors players visit Harry , who is all wet and dirty . 
George says : 
- Harry , an unbelievable fly ! 
He had just heard Marcus Flint screaming Malfoy . 
Something about the snitch that hovered over his head that he did not know . 
Malfoy looks so happy . 
They make cake , candy , and bottles of pumpkin juice . 
They gathered around Harry's bed and were just about ready for a party , Pomfrey appeared as a storm , shouting : 
- go out ! 
He needs to rest , he needs to grow thirty three bones , do not you ? 
GET OUT NOW ! 
So Harry was left alone in ventricular disease , no one was disturbed to forget about the pain as the knife tightly in his fingers numb . 
Hours later , Harry suddenly woke up in the darkness . 
He uttered a painful moan : his arms were now aching as if they were full of broken bones . 
For the first few seconds , he thought that this pain had awakened him . 
Then , a horror struck , as he realized there was someone in the darkness who was covering his forehead . 
She yelled : 
- Stay away ! 
Then recognize immediately : 
The elf has two bulging eyes like two balls 
- Dobby ! 
The elf had two big protruding eyes like two green tennis balls staring at Harry in the dark . 
A single tear runs along the long and sharp nose . 
The elf whispered affectionately : 
- Harry Potter has returned to school . 
Dobby had warned him repeatedly . 
And , why do not you listen to Dobby's advice ? 
Why did Harry go to school , refusing to return home when he missed the train ? 
Harry squatted up on the pillow , pushing Dobby's forehead . 
She asked : 
- What are you doing here , Dobby ? 
And how did you know I missed the train ? 
Harry's lips trembled , Harry suddenly burst into a doubt . 
He slowly said : 
- So you ! 
You have made the fence not let us pass ! 
Dobby nodded , his ears wagging : 
- Sir , yes . 
Dobby stole Harry Potter , cast a spell on the gate , and then Dobby had to iron his hand . 
The ten - fingered elf was wrapped in a ribbon for Harry . 
" But Dobby does not regret it , sir . 
Because Dobby only thinks about the safety of Harry Potter , it is unlikely that Harry Potter will ever come to school in any other way . 
The elf swayed from front to back and back . 
Its ugly head shook and shook . 
- Dobby is shocked to hear that Harry Potter is still back to Hogwarts . 
So stunned that he scorched his master's dinner . 
Dobby was hit with an unprecedented blow , my dear 
Harry rubbed his head again . 
It angrily grumbled : 
- You nearly made Ron with me expelled . 
Dobby , you soulful , disappears before my bones are healed , otherwise I will twist you to see . 
Dobby smiled weakly : 
" Sir , Dobby is dying to death . 
Dobby's house was threatened to kill five times a day . 
The elf blew his nose at the blanket of the pillow that he was wearing , which was so gruesome that Harry's wrath fell , though he still wanted to be angry . 
She asked curiously : 
- Why are you wearing that thing , Dobby ? 
Dobby pulled up the pillow and said , 
- This one is you ? This is the slave's badge of an elf , sir . 
Dobby is free only when his master gives him clothes . 
So the owner of the family is very careful , never give Dobby a sock , sir , because just enough is enough to free Dobby and Dobby will leave never come back . 
The elf pulled his two protruding eyes and said suddenly : 
- Harry Potter must go home ! 
Dobby thinks its bludger is enough to make it 
- Your Left Bludger ? 
Anger in Harry's voice : 
- Your Bludger , what do you mean ? 
Did you cast a Bludger spell to kill me ? 
Dobby shivered . 
- Not to kill you , sir , no way to kill you . 
Dobby just wanted to save your life . 
You would rather come home , even if you are injured , than here . 
Dobby just wants Harry Potter to be hurt enough to be taken home . 
Harry more anger : 
- Is that all ? 
Do you intend to tell me why you want people to send my broken bones home ? 
Dobby mourns , tears streaming down the drenched knee shirt . 
- Oh , if only Harry Potter knew ! 
If only he knew what he meant to us , the humble little elves slaves , despised in the wizarding world . 
Sir , Dobby still remember the time Ke - call - not - named - out monster dread . We were treated like worms . 
Sir , now that Dobby is still being treated like this . 
Dobby looked at him , wiping his pillow , and continued : 
" But , sir , life has improved for the elves since you have won the power of the No - Caller . " 
Harry Potter still lives , and the powers of the Dark side are shattered . 
Dear Sir , a new dawn opens , and Harry Potter shines like a star of hope for people like us , who keep wondering the dark days never ending . 
Sir , now in Hogwarts , terrible things are about to happen , which may happen . 
And Dobby could not let Harry Potter stay here , as history seemed to be repeating itself , as the Secret Room was once again opened . 
Dobby suddenly panicked , grabbing Harry's drink from the bedside table , which hit his head so hard that he fell to the floor , rolling away . 
After a while , he crawled back to the bedside , his eyes panting , his mouth murmuring : 
- Dobby bad , Dobby bad 
Harry whispered : 
- So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? 
And you just said it was open before ? 
Dobby , tell me now ! 
Harry grasped the elf's elbow as he reached for the water bottle to punish himself again . 
- How do I get dangerous when the room opens ? 
Am I not from the Muggle family ? 
The eyes of the elf , which is very big , again in the dark , stammered : 
- Oh , please , do not ask again . 
Please do not hesitate to ask Dobby again . 
The dark plot is going on here , but Harry Potter should not be here when that happens Go home , Harry Potter . 
Please go home . 
Harry Potter should not be involved in this struggle , it is dangerous 
Harry clutched Dobby's wrist more tightly to prevent it from pounding the water in his head again . 
Harry asked : 
- Dobby , who is that ? Who opened the Chamber of Secrets ? 
Who opened it last time ? 
The crying elf bellowed : 
" Sir , Dobby can not say , can not , can not say ! 
Go home , Harry Potter , go home ! 
Harry is angry : 
- I will not go anywhere ! 
One of my best friends came from the Muggle family , if the Secret Chamber really opened up , she would be the first to be harmed . 
Dobby groaned in an extremely painful state : 
- Harry Potter risk his life for friends ! 
How noble ! 
How brave ! 
But he must also save himself ! 
Harry Potter is not 
Dobby suddenly silenced , his ears batlike like a bat . 
Harry also heard . 
There were footsteps approaching the corridor . 
- Dobby must go ! 
The awful creature , gasping . 
A scream sounded and Harry's hand held only the air . 
He rolled himself under the blanket on the bed , his eyes still open in the dark , toward the door as the footsteps came closer . 
Just a moment later , Dumbledore appears by jumping back into the room . 
He wears a long nightgown and wears a sleep hat . 
He was carrying a head of something like a statue . 
Professor McGonagall appears immediately after , carrying the statue's feet . 
Two people put the statue on a bed . 
Dumbledore said softly : 
- go to Mrs. Pomfrey . 
Professor McGonagall immediately passed Harry's bed . 
Harry lay still , pretending to be asleep . 
He heard urgent voices , and then McGonagall hurried back , with Mrs. Pomfrey following in the footsteps . 
Mrs. Pomfrey walked into the room with her sleeveless sweater across her head , dressed in a nightgown . 
Harry sounded like she took a quick breath . 
Mrs. Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore as she bent down to look at the statue . 
- What happened ? 
Dumbledore said : 
- Another attack . 
Professor McGonagall discovers the boy on the stairs . 
Additional professor : 
- With a bunch of grapes on the side . 
I think this kid is going to visit Harry . 
Harry's stomach ached . 
He slowly edged up his head slowly to see the statue's face on the bed . 
A moonlit projection illuminated the face of the statue . 
It was Colin Creevey , his eyes wide , his hands still stiffened in front of him , holding his camera . 
Mrs. Pomfrey asked : 
- Are you petrified ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Right . 
But I shudder at the thought . If Dumbledore was not coming down the stairs to get hot chocolate , then who knew what could happen ? 
The three looked at Colin . 
Then Dumbledore leaned forward , pulling out the camera in Colin's arms . 
Professor McGonagall eagerly said : 
- Do you think the boy was trying to take a picture of him attacking it ? 
Dumbledore did not answer . 
He opened the camera box of the camera . 
Mrs. Pomfrey exclaimed , 
- Devil spirit ! 
A spray of smoke from the machine . 
Harry lying there three beds also smell the smell of plastic film flattened . 
Mrs. Pomfrey panicked : 
- Waste all . 
All spent 
Professor McGonagall urgently asked : 
- What does this mean , Dumbledore ? 
Dumbledore said : 
- The Secret Chamber was opened again . 
Mrs. Pomfrey raised her hand . 
Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore . 
- But Dumbledore is sure but who ? 
Dumbledore was still looking at Colin . 
- The problem is not who , what is the problem 
From Harry's place , he could see Professor McGonagall's sullen face . 
He found that the professor did not seem to understand much about it . 
Chapter 11 : THE HANDBOOK 
On Sunday morning , Harry woke up , realizing that the dormitory was overflowing with the bright rays of a precipitation day , and that his hands were full of bone but still stiff . 
He hurried up to look over Colin's bed , but could not see anything because there was a curtain in the middle . 
As Harry woke up , Mrs. Pomfrey came in with a breakfast tray . 
Next , she began to fold her fingers and reach for Harry's arm , pulling them out . 
She said : 
- Where is it ? 
Harry scooped his own porridge with his left hand . 
Mrs. Pomfrey said : 
- When you finish eating , you can leave . 
Harry hurriedly rushed to Gryffindor Tower , eager to tell Hermione and Ron the story of Colin and Dobby . 
But neither of them was in the dorm . 
Harry walks around looking for you , wondering where they might go , in the heart of a little narcissism when the two of them do not seem to care about whether the bones of it grow back or not . To 
When walking through the library , Percy is coming out of it , looking more cheerful than before meeting a lot . 
Percy said : 
- Hello Harry ! 
Today's flight was excellent . is excellent . 
The Gryffindor House , which led the way in the Home Cup competition , earned fifty points ! 
Harry asked : 
- Do you see where Ron and Hermione are ? 
Percy's smile faded , he said : 
- I do not see . 
But I hope that Ron does not go to another female toilet 
Harry grinned at Percy's joke . 
He followed him until he was out of sight , and aimed at the ladies ' bathhouse - the ghostly mausoleum of Myrtle - and walked over . 
Harry could not quite figure out why Ron and Hermione had gotten into that place again , but they kept sneaking in there to find them , after looking ahead to find out that Filch was not around . Another leader . 
The door to the toilet was opened , Harry heard the two of them , coming out of a locker room . 
Harry immediately stepped in , closed the door immediately , spoke up : 
- I'm here . 
There was a clattering sound , with the sound of the noise from the inside of the enclosed toilet . 
The opening of the hole opened Hermione's eyes to look out . 
She exclaimed : 
- Harry ! 
You make us all soul . 
Come in . 
How is your hand ? 
- Strong . 
Harry forced himself through the open door . 
He saw the old cauldron on the toilet , the bottom of the cauldron crackling , indicating that the other two groups a small fire . 
This is one of Hermione's specialties that allows for portable , waterproof flames . 
Ron locked the door and tried to explain to Harry hardly : 
" We were going to visit you , but then decided to start working on a multi - drug drug . 
We think it is best to hide this place . 
Harry had just begun to tell Colin's story and Hermione interrupted : 
" We know it all , " Professor McGonagall told Professor Flitwick earlier this morning . 
That's why we decided that we should 
Ron : 
- make Malfoy confess as soon as possible . 
Do you know what I think ? It was , because of the madness after losing the Quidditch match , that he was angry at the hitman , hit by Colin . 
Harry looked at Hermione for a moment and said , 
- There's one more thing . 
Dobby came to me at midnight yesterday . 
Ron and Hermione looked up , startled . 
Harry told them all that Dobby had said - or dared not say it . 
Hermione and Ron gasped . 
Hermione murmured : 
- The Secret Chamber was opened before ? 
Said Ron in a triumphant voice : 
So it is clear that Malfoy's father , Lucius Malfoy , had opened the Secret Chamber at Hogwarts . 
And now his son , Draco Malfoy , remembers it . 
It is obvious . 
Did Dobby tell you what the monster inside the Chamber of Secrets was ? 
I wonder how horrible , how can no one recognize when it is sneaking around the school ? 
Hermione croaked several leeches at the bottom of the cauldron and said , 
- Maybe it knows stealth . 
Or perhaps it disguises - pretend to be an armor for example . 
At that time I have read about the Vampire Gecko cotton 
- You read so much , Hermione ! 
Said Ron , with his hands still pouring thin flies on the leeches . 
Harry's shell , look at Harry : 
So it was Dobby who stopped us from getting onto the Hogwarts Express train on the day of school ? 
Then it broke his hand ? 
He shook his head and continued : 
" You know , Harry , if he does not give up that type of rescue , then it will probably make him sick . 
Colin was petrified and was lying dead in the void that quickly spread throughout the school on Monday morning . 
The atmosphere was suddenly filled with suspicions and rumors that stifled . 
The first - year students now dare to walk around the castle in clutter and squeeze each other , as if they are afraid of going out alone and attacked . 
Ginny , you sit at the table with Colin in the Charms class , is almost distraught . 
But Harry found that the way Fred and George set up to poke fun at her was not a good one : they took turns hiding behind statues , covered their heads with fur or shirts , and suddenly jumped off the girl . 
They only tolerate that when Chief Percy gets upset by anger , threatening to write a letter to her that Ginny is having a nightmare . 
At the same time , a secret movement was spreading throughout the school : the students secretly swapped , traded amulets , puzzles , and other bodyguards , without letting the teacher know . . 
Neville bought a large green onion , with the smell of the devil , a piece of shiny purple glass , and a decayed doe tail . 
The other Gryffindors in the Gryffindor family told Neville that it had nothing to do with it : it was a purebred descent , no risk in the Slytherin Succession . 
But Neville's chubby face remained pale in fear : 
- Master Filch was attacked too ! 
You are a Squib , I know you are almost Squib . [ ( Squib : Spit , witch son of the family that do not know how to do magic ) ] 
On the second week of December , Professor McGonagall went to a dormitory to enroll students who would stay at the school for Christmas . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione all have names . 
They heard that Malfoy would also be on Christmas break at school . This made them more suspicious and led to the decision to take the holiday as the best time to bring a pandemic drug to Malfoy's confession . 
Unfortunately , the drug is only in the middle of the process . 
They are now in need of the horn of the serpent code and the shrapnel of a serpent , but the only place to get them is in Snape's own warehouse . 
Harry thought it was better to confront the monster than to have Snape catch him at the robbery in his office . 
At noon Thursday there were two consecutive poisonings of Snape . 
Said Hermione decisively : 
- We have to put up a war , to distract the attention of the teacher , so that one of the masses sneak into his office , stealing what we need . 
Harry and Ron looked at her anxiously . 
Hermione continued by voice - huhchtoẹt - ra - cho - then : 
- I'm going to be a rambler . 
Two of you that were caught in violation of the rules are fired , and the criminal record is still clean . 
So all you have to do is make a fuss to keep Snape in class for about five minutes . 
Between the rows are two dozen cauldrons that are smoking ; On the table , 
Harry laughed weakly . 
Deliberately causing a clutter in Snape's poison class , there was nothing else to do with the sticks of a sleeping dragon . 
The poison class is in a large basement . 
That Thursday was normal . 
Between the rows are two dozen cauldrons that are smoking ; on the table any balance , any medicine containers . 
In the fog of smoke , Snape snapped , critiquing what the Gryffindor students did , while the Slytherin chuckled . 
Draco Malfoy , Snape's daddy , set fireballs on Ron and Harry's face . 
The two of you try to know that retaliation is also prohibited before the protest is so unfair ! . 
Harry's swollen solution was still loose , but he did not mind . His mind was busy with much more important things . 
Harry was waiting for Hermione to take action , so he would not hear Snape sneering at the medicine while he was standing at the cauldron , as soon as he had left to bully Neville , Hermione Harry gave his eyes , nodding slightly . 
Harry quickly ducked down behind his cauldron , pulling out of Fred's pocket a firecracker in his pocket , using his wand as a bait . 
The gun began to flicker . 
Knowing that the opportunity for me only a few seconds , Harry stood straight , aiming , throwing strong cannon . 
The cannon flew a rainbow , and landed on the target of Goyle's cauldron . 
The drug in Goyle's cauldron explodes and splashes through the classroom . 
The pupils scream as the swelling of bullets hits the victim . 
Malfoy's face was full and his nose began to swell like a bubble ; Goyle held his hands out loud with a fork , holding up two eyes , fumbling around . 
Snape tried to calm down and immediately found out what had happened . 
In that chaotic scene , Harry saw Hermione quietly peering into his office . 
The crooked one on the side because the weight of the arm is swollen like a pestle , the child can not speak because his lips are almost full face . 
Snape's teacher screamed : 
- SILENT ! SILENT ! The game is thrown into the swelling of the drug , but here comes the poison . 
I find the first name of this case 
Harry tried to look away as Malfoy rushed forward , his head slumped down by the weight of his bulging nose with a small watermelon . 
Half the class was snuffed around Snape's desk , and the other was crooked , because the weight of his arm was swollen like a broom , and he could not speak because his lips were almost full . , Harry saw Hermione lightly in her class , her skirt was pale . 
As each swollen student made an antidote of gauntlets and small , bulging sized nappies , Snape brushed Goyle's cauldron , spilling out some of the blackened remains of the firework . 
The class suddenly fell like a sheet . 
Snape snapped , 
- I found the game has thrown this gun , I guarantee that the game will be fired . 
Snape looked directly at Harry and tried to keep a look that he hoped might be mysterious . 
Ten minutes later , the bell rang , it was happy . 
Never heard the bell before . 
When the three rushed to Myrtle's crying crypt , Harry said , 
- I dare to know that the culprit is me . 
Hermione whipped up the new material and stirred up impatiently . 
She excitedly said : 
- Two weeks is over . 
Ron assured Harry : 
- What did Snape prove you were the culprit ? 
So what can you do ? 
Harry looked down at the medicine they were making , bubbling : 
- touching Snape's master is out of network . 
A week later , when Harry , Ron , and Hermione were crossing the lobby , a crowd gathered around a note , reading a piece of parchment paper on the table . 
Dean and Seamus beckoned them back , very excited . 
Seamus says : 
- People are setting up a duel club ! 
Tonight there is a first meeting ! 
I do not mind the lessons of duel ; Especially on these days , I know where I need to be 
Said Ron : 
- What ? Slytherin's Slytherin Slytherin knows how to challenge duels ? 
Even so , Ron read the message intently , then said to Harry and Hermione : 
- It is also very useful . 
Do we participate ? 
Harry and Hermione supported , so at eight o ' clock that evening , they hurried back to the Great Hall . 
Long rows of tables were moved away , giving way to a golden ring placed along a wall . 
Thousands of candles are lit up above . 
The ceiling was once again black as velvet , and almost all of the students at the school were present , holding each other with their wand and nervous expression . 
Said Hermione , as the two of them jostled in the crowd : 
- Do not know who will teach us ? 
Someone told me that Flitwick was a champion of dueling when he was young - maybe Flitwick would teach us too . 
Harry said : 
- As long as it is not 
But his words ended in a loud voice : Lockhart was stepping into the ring , shining in his plum red robe , beside him , no other than Snape in his usual black robes . day . 
Mr. Lockhart raised his hand and waved silent and called : 
- Come here ! 
Get back together ! 
Do people see me clearly ? 
Did you hear me ? 
Very good ! 
He cleared his throat : 
- Well , Professor Dumbledore has allowed me to set up this Double Club , to train all the games when I need to defend myself , as I myself had to fight self defense in countless schools . - Just read my published books to know the full details of this . 
With a bright smile on his face , Mr. Lockhart continued : 
- I would like to introduce my assistant , Professor Snape . 
He told me that he himself knew a little bit about the duel and agreed on the spirit of sport to help me do some acting before we started . 
Well , I do not want to let these young ladies worry - I'm sure after I dueled with him , the game still has his master's poison , do not be afraid ! 
Ron whispered in Harry's ear : 
- If two people destroy each other is not it better ? 
Snape's upper lip curled up . 
Harry did not understand why Lockhart was still smiling . 
Meet him , if Snape teacher that look at it , then it must have taken care of soul that runaway . 
Lockhart and Snape came up facing each other and bowed . 
At least Lockhart greeted with a skillful , well - rounded arm . 
And Snape just nodded indignantly . 
Then both of them raised their wands as if raising their hands in front of them . 
Lockhart said to his students : 
As you can see , we were raising our wand in an acceptable battle position . 
After counting three hours , we will launch the first curse . 
Of course , no one intentionally killed anyone . 
Harry looked at Snape's clenched teeth : 
- I do not dare to bet . 
- One two Three 
Both teachers swung their sticks across their heads and pointed at the opponent . 
Snape shouted : 
- Expelliarmus . [ ( This sentence will be separated : expel - ridiculed , liar - the screamer , mus - mouse = the third ball is falling , throw away the mouse ! ) ] 
An explosion sounded at Lockhart's feet , causing the teacher to drop out of the ring , 
A flash of red light flashed , an explosion sounded at Lockhart's feet , causing him to fall behind , dropping out of the ring , bumping into the wall , falling down and lying on the floor . 
Malfoy and Slytherin applauded . 
Hermione nervously jumped on her toes , while her fingers pressed against her lips , trying to stop the screams of pain : 
- What do you think you have ? 
Harry and Ron both said , 
- He's a shelf ! 
Mr. Lockhart stood on his bare feet firmly . 
His hat fell , and his wavy hair stood on top of his head . 
Stepping up to the ring , the teacher said : 
- Well , you see . That's disarmament - games , I lost my wand Well , here it is , thank you Brown , Professor Snape , that magic performance was a great idea , but I Tell him not to bother , but his magic is too obvious , I want to disable it is easy . 
However , I feel it would be a good education if I let the kids 
Snape's face in the gas . 
Maybe Lockhart noticed that too , so he said , 
- This show is enough ! 
I will go down with the game , divide the game into pairs . 
Lockhart assembled Neville with Justin , and Snape went straight to Harry and Ron . 
Teacher smirked : 
- I think it's time to break up . 
Ron , paired with Finnigan . 
Harry 
Harry turns to Hermione automatically . 
But Snape still smiled coldly : 
- I can not . 
Malfoy , come here . Try to see what works with Harry famous . 
Hermione , a duel with Bulstrode . 
Malfoy stammered forward , with a contemptuous grin . 
Behind it was a little girl next to Slytherin . 
This little girl reminded Harry of a picture she had seen in The Witchhunter , because she was ebony and her chin was heavy and full of aggressive aggression . 
Hermione gave a weak smile , but the girl did not respond . 
Mr. Lockhart stepped up to the ring called : 
- Let's face it ! 
And bow ! 
Harry and Malfoy barely tilted their head a little , eyes never leaving their opponents . 
Lockhart shouted : 
- ready wand ! 
When I count to three , throw your spells at the opponent . 
Dismissal of the opponent's weapon only - We do not want anyone to have an accident at all - One Two Three 
Harry waved his wand , but Malfoy took his hand , right from the second count : Malfoy's spit knocked Harry so hard he felt a great pan on his head . 
Harry staggered , but struggled and did not lose a second , he straightened his wand at Malfoy's face and shouted : 
- Rictusempra . [ ( Rictus : 
This mantra can be translated as : hiding , choking , crying ! ) ] 
Master Lockhart's voice was loud , warned , on the black head fighting soap bar : 
- I told you just disarmed ! 
Malfoy grinned . 
Harry had beaten Malfoy with a Charm , making Malfoy no laugh . 
Harry felt hesitant to hit Malfoy rolling on the floor , but it was a mistake . 
As he opened his mouth to breathe , Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees and read : 
- Tarantallegra ! [ ( Tarantula : an Italian fast dance , Allegra : fast beat . 
This sentence means : Shaggy snatching , spit toe ring round ! ) ] 
Immediately , Harry's legs began to dance like crazy , no way to control . 
Lockhart shouted : 
- Stop ! 
Oh ! 
No matter what . 
Mr. Snape intervened : 
- Finite Incantatem ! [ ( Magic Recovery ) ] 
After the cry of Snape , Harry's legs stopped dancing , Malfoy stopped laughing , and both of them could look up . 
A faint smoke is covering the whole scene . 
Neville and Justin both lay rolling on the floor . 
Ron was holding up a Seamus face as gray as an ash , apologizing for the wickedness that his wand caused . 
But Hermione and Bulstrode are still dancing . 
Hermione was severely beaten by her Uncle Big , who was crying in pain ; Both of them were left lying on the floor . 
Harry jumped out of Hermione . 
It's hard : Bigger than Harry . 
Mr. Lockhart looked at the aftermath of the duel , clicking his words : 
- Come on . 
Come on Macmillan , let go . Watch out , Fawcett Boot game clamped tight , a little bit it stopped bleeding . 
Standing in a cloud of smoke in the hall , Lockhart cajoled the uproar : 
- I must teach you how to lock the curse is not friendly ! 
Lockhart glanced at Snape . His black eyes emitted a glint of light , but he quickly looked away . 
Mr. Lockhart continued : 
- We need a couple of volunteers to do the test - Neville and Finch are here - What do you see , brother ? 
Mr. Snape dismissed immediately : 
- It's not good , Professor Lockhart . 
Neville with a simple mantra will also cause a cruel desolate scene . 
And Finch may just be enough in the box to bring the disease . 
Neville's flushed round face flushed red . 
Mr. Snape continued with a grim smile : 
- Well , Harry and Malfoy , how do you feel ? 
Lockhart agreed : 
- excellent comments ! 
He motioned for Harry and Malfoy to go to the middle of the hall , the crowd backing up to leave room for their talent . 
Lockhart said : 
- Listen , Harry , when Malfoy pointed his wand at the game , the game is like this . 
He scooped up his wand , trying to make a complicated move and dropped the wand . 
Snape laughed at Lockhart and hurriedly picked up the wand and said , 
- Yes ! 
My wand is too energetic ! 
Snape came over to Malfoy , bent down , whispering something to him . 
Malfoy smiled wryly . 
Harry looked at Lockhart and said , 
" Sir , please point me to the curse once again . 
Malfoy whispered to Lockhart from hearing : 
- Are you scared yet ? 
Harry said through the corner of his mouth : 
- Long time ! 
Lockhart patted Harry's shoulder happily : 
- Just do as I say , Harry ! 
- Yes , what ? 
To drop the wand like a teacher ? 
But Lockhart did not listen anymore . 
He shouted : 
- Three Two One Get Started ! 
Malfoy raised his chopsticks quickly and read the mantra : 
- Serpemsprtia ! [ ( Attack Tower ) ] 
Malfoy's chopsticks exploded . 
A long black snake popped out , slammed into the empty floor between the two , then raised his head , ready to attack . 
Harry watched in horror . The crowd jumped back and forth , more and more screams resounded . 
Snape was obviously delighted with Harry's dying expression , as if hypnotized by the snake , his eyes glaring in the snake's eyes . 
Snape said : 
- do not budge , Harry . Let's get rid of it 
- Let's me do it ! 
And as he rushed forward in front of the serpent , he shouted : Let go of her ! 
Lockhart shouted . 
He waved the wand over the snake's head , and a loud bang sounded : the snake did not disappear but sped up into the air about three feet and fell to the floor with a loud screech . 
Furious , the snake hisses and crawls toward Justin Finch - Fletchley . 
He raised his head , pointed sharp teeth , posture ready to operate a target worthy of women . 
At that time , Harry did not know what made him act like that . 
It made absolutely no consideration at all . 
He only noticed that his legs were on his toes as if his wheels were under his feet . 
And as he rushed forward in front of the serpent , he shouted : 
- Let go of you ! 
And it's wonderful - can not explain - the snake head was lying on the floor , curled up like a black plastic pipe in the garden , Harry's eyes look obedient . 
Harry felt very well that he had run out of fear . 
He knew the snake would not attack anyone . 
But if you ask him why he is so sure it will , it does not explain . 
Harry looked up at Justin Finch , grinning , thinking Justin would be lightweight , or otherwise look grateful . 
Where is Justin more afraid of people and angry indescribable . 
The boy shouted : 
- What are you playing ? 
Harry did not say anything , justin turned around and ran away from the Hall . 
Snape came in , waved his wand one , and the snake's eye disappeared in a pale black smoke . 
He also looked at Harry strangely : a cleverly calculated view that Harry did not like at all . 
He also felt vaguely buzzing around or not coughing . 
Then he felt his robes pulled back . 
Ron's voice near his ear : 
- go . go out , come out 
Ron pulled it through the crowd out of the Hall . 
Hermione hastily followed behind him . 
When the three of us walked through the door , the men reached out on either side as if they were frightened by a terrible scene . 
Harry did not quite understand what was going on . 
Ron and Hermione did not explain until they pulled it up to the common room in the Gryffindor Tower . 
Ron then pushed Harry into the armchair and said , 
- Why do not you tell us you're a messenger ? 
Harry looked puzzled : 
- What ? 
- a mess ! 
You can talk to Snake ! 
Harry remained calm : 
- I know , I want to say this is the second time I did it . 
Last time was when I accidentally dropped a python out of the Dursleys cousin at the zoo - a long , long story - python told me it has never seen Brazil and I released it without actually conscientious - I did not know that I was a witch 
Ron reckons : 
- The python tells you that he has never seen Brazil ? 
- That's okay ? 
Harry did not know why Ron was so pale . 
It says : 
- I'm sure there are tons of people here who can do that . 
But Ron said , 
- No , no one can do it . that is a rare gift . 
Harry , this is bad . 
- What's wrong ? 
Harry begins to feel angry : 
- What evidence of what ? You know : If you do not tell that snake do not attack Justin 
- Wow , you told that snake ? 
- What does that mean ? 
At that time you were there - you heard me 
Said Ron : 
- We just heard you say Batu , the snake . Who knows what you say at that time . 
So Justin was frightened , and it sounded like he was asking for a snake to do something - you know , that scene made everyone shine . 
Harry gasped at Ron : 
- I speak another language ? 
But I do not know How can I say a language without knowing that I'm speaking it ? 
Ron shook his head . 
Ron and Hermione look like they're out . 
But Harry still did not understand what was so serious about that ? 
It says : 
- Could you please tell me what's wrong with hindering a giant snake ? 
No matter what I did , it was okay , just as long as Justin did not have to rush into the hunting squad of the headless horsemen ? 
Hermione spoke in an unusually quiet voice : 
- it's alright 
Because talking to snakes is likely to have made Salazar Slytherin famous . 
That is why the Slytherin symbol is a python . 
Harry gasped , unable to close . 
Ron added : 
- right . 
And now the whole school is figuring out that you are some of the best of the bunch 
- But I'm not 
Harry screams with horror that he can not explain himself . 
Hermione said : 
- You will hardly prove yourself right or not . 
Salazar Slytherin lived thousands of years ago . 
With all this we know , you are probably the descendant of him . 
That night Harry lay awake . 
Through the crevices of the curtains around the bed , he watched the snow begin falling outside the castle window and wondered 
Could it be the descendant of Salazar Slytherin ? 
He does not know anything about the family inside . 
Uncle Dursley always forbid it to ask nothing of its wives . 
Harry quietly try to say a few words . 
But no words were uttered . 
It seems only when faced with a snake , it reveals that ability . 
But I'm a Gryffindor member ! Harry thought . The sorting hat would not have made me Gryffindor if I had had Slytherin blood . 
There seemed to be a slight voice in Harry's head : 
" Well , I do not remember , at first the classified hat wanted to be in the Slytherin house . 
Harry struggled all night . 
He is looking forward to seeing Justin the next morning in herbal medicine , explaining to Justin that he just wanted the snake not to bite Justin , not to bite the snake to hurt anyone . This should be the most stupid person to recognize it ! ( He thought , that is , punched the pillow but did not eat anything . ) 
However , the next morning , the snowstorm had turned into a snowstorm . 
The snow fell so hard that the last semester of the semester was postponed : Professor Sprout needed to wear socks and a scarf for the ginseng , a task that required extreme ingenuity that she was not . trust someone enough to entrust ; Especially when they need to grow up to revive Noris and Colin . 
Taking care of ginseng is therefore becoming more important multiples . 
In Gryffindor's common room , Harry sat by the fire while sneaking up on his grief , while Hermione and Ron admit to taking a break and playing a witchcraft game . 
Harry sat by the fire , grinding his sadness , while Hermione and Ron admit to taking a break and playing a witchcraft game . 
While Hermione's knight's knight was knocked down by Ron's bishop and pulled out of the chessboard , Hermione snapped at Harry : 
- Harry , if you see Justin making you so miserable , then just go find him and say it . 
So Harry stood up and went through the portrait hole , wondering where Justin was . 
The castle is more murky than usual because of the heavy gray snow outside the windows . 
Shivered by the chill , Harry wandered through the classrooms , glimpsing the scenes going on inside the classrooms . 
Professor McGonagall was scolding a pupil , but based on the scolding , the naughty boy turned his friend into a badger . 
Resisting the desire to see what happened , Harry left . 
Think maybe this time Justin is doing something , can look up articles , for example , Harry went to the library first . 
A group of Hufflepuff students are taking a break from her studies . Herbs are sitting at the bottom of the library , but they do not seem to be working . 
Between the two bookshelves , Harry could see the crowd gathering , looking as though they were drunk in a very interesting conversation . 
Harry did not see there was Justin in there 
are not . Going in that direction , the random whispering incident happened in Harry's ears , and he stood up , hiding behind the Invisible Shack , listening . 
One big fat says : 
- Come on , I told Justin to hide in the dormitory . 
My hat is , if Harry had doted him as the next victim , it would be best to avoid him for a while . 
Of course , Justin had guessed that it would have happened , since he had accidentally told Harry that he was a Muggle . 
Justin had told him he was enrolled in Eton . 
Like that , who brings a crappy talk to his successor Slytherin , right ? 
A child with a pigtail worriedly asked : 
" Are you sure that the successor is Harry , Ernie ? " 
The big boy made a serious expression : 
- Hannah , he's a messenger . 
Everyone knows that is the sign of a dark sorcerer . 
Have you ever heard of someone who is kind enough to talk to snakes ? 
It is Slytherin , also known as the Passer . 
The whisper came up to hear this , but Ernie continued : 
- Remember the message on the wall ? The enemy of his successor , let's soul . Harry had a clash with Filch , so then , as we all know , Filch's cat was attacked . 
And that first - year kid , Colin , just dared to harass Harry in the Quidditch match , dare to take a picture of Harry in the muddy hole , get enough later , see ? 
Hannah bewildered : 
- But I find it always cute . 
With it , the one who made Who - who - well - know - is - disappeared . 
Then how can it be so bad ? 
Ernie lowered her voice secretly , and the Hufflepuffs pressed their heads together . 
Harry also moved forward to try to hear what Ernie said . 
- no one knows how it survived after the murder of Who - who - knows - well - who . 
I said that it happened , it was just a baby . 
It should have been crushed by the curse . 
Only the dark magic witch survived the terrible curse . 
She lowered her voice to almost impossible to hear , continued : 
- Maybe that's why the Who - who - knows - who - wants to kill it in the first place . 
He does not want another Dark Lord to compete for power with him . 
Do not know how much Harry hides how much power is not used anymore . 
Harry could not take it anymore . 
He cleared his throat , and stepped out of the bookshelf . 
If it is not in extreme anger , it must be 
The Hufflepuffs seemed petrified when they saw Harry appear , and Ernie's face cut off no blood . 
Harry said : 
- Hello friends . 
I'm looking for Justin Finch - Fletchley . 
The worst fears of the Hufflepuffs are so obvious . 
They all looked at Ernie . 
- What do you do for it ? Ernie asked in a trembling voice . 
Harry replied , 
- I want to explain to him what really happened to the snake at the Double Club . 
Ernie bit her white lips , then took a deep breath , saying : 
- All of them are there . 
We also with the snake , it has withdrawn ? 
Ernie's voice was still trembling with fear , but it was still stubborn : 
" All we see is you talk and whip the snake at Justin . 
Harry's voice was trembling , too : 
- I did not bother snake bite Justin . 
The snake has not touched Justin yet ! 
- It just missed the hair . 
Then Ernie added : 
- And in case you intend to target me , then I tell you you can trace to nine of my family are witches and my blood is as pure as any real witch blood any 
Harry furiously interrupted Ernie : 
- I do not know what kind of blood you are ! 
Why do I want to harm those of Muggle blood ? 
Ernie answered immediately : 
- I heard you hate the Muggle who live with you . 
Harry exclaimed : 
- Can not live with the Dursleys without hating them ! 
Try living with them and know ! 
Harry turned his back , dashed out of the library , scolded by Mrs. Pince ; At the time , she was polishing the gilded crown of a giant mantra . 
Harry went back up the corridor , barely noticing where he was going in the madness . 
As a result , it crashed into something big and bounced back , rolling hard to the floor . 
He looked up , calling out : 
- Oh , hello Hagrid . 
Hagrid's face was completely sealed in a snow - covered wool cap . 
But the huge body in the mothboard mantle nearing the corridor could not be confused with anyone else . 
The old man's gauntlet was the death of a dead rooster . 
He pulled his head down to open his mouth . 
- Is that alright , Harry ? 
Why are not you in the classroom ? 
Harry stood up : 
- Herbal classes . 
What are you doing here ? 
" Hagrid , " the old man said , 
- this is the second child killed in this semester . 
Maybe the culprit is the fox , but can also be blistering Blood , I have to ask Dumbledore to allow him to use some magic to cast spells chicken coop . 
Then his eyes were covered with snow to look at Harry carefully : 
- Are you alright ? 
Look at you baby star that wear so ! 
Harry could not help but let Hagrid hear the story of Ernie and the other Hufflepuffs talking about it . 
It says : 
- utter rubbish . 
But you have to go , Hagrid , come to study now , I have to go back to get the book . 
It was walking in his mind , but Ernie was talking about it . Justin guessed that it would have happened , since he had forgotten that he was a Muggle . 
He staggered up the stairs , turning to another long corridor . 
This corridor was especially dark because the torches were damped by the strong winds blowing through the closed windows . 
He walked down the hallway and stumbled across something on the floor . 
He turned to glance at what had made him fall and suddenly found his intestines fluttered . 
Justin was lying on the floor , frozen and cold , his eyes blank , staring up at the ceiling , astonished by the shock of his face . 
And not just Justin himself . 
Beside it was another form , the most weird one Harry had ever seen . 
It's Nick's Headshot , but this ghost is not transparent with a faint white color , black and smoky , as well as grimy , but hovering in the air in the horizontal position , away from the floor . about two feet . The head of the ghost Nearly the head has fallen in half , and its expression has a horrible look just like Justin's face . 
Harry stood up , his breath rushing , his heart pounding in his chest . 
He stared up into the hallway down the corridor , only saw a bunch of spiders connected that run away from the two bodies as quickly as possible . 
The only sound that could be heard at that time was the lecture of the teachers scattered from the classrooms along the corridor . 
Harry thought he needed to run away from this place , no one would know it was here . 
But it can not leave the two innocent . It feels like you need to do something to help . Does anyone believe it has nothing to do with this ? 
While Harry was standing there in horror , the door to his right suddenly opened . 
The Peeves gobbled up and cried out : 
- Reason ? 
Turns out he was a kid Potter ! 
The goblin crawled over Harry , crossing Harry's glasses for a pair of glasses . 
- Hey , Harry , what are you doing ? 
Why hide hid like that ? 
In mid - air , the Peeves goblin suddenly stopped . 
He flipped his head down , observing Justin and Nick's Headbutt . 
Then it popped back , soaring high to the lungs that loudly chanted loudly : 
- ATTACK ! REFUND TONS OF OTHER TONES ! NO WAYS OR WOMEN HAVE BEEN LOVED ! MATERIALS RUNNING ! HAPPY ! 
Safes - Safes - Safes - the doors along the two corridors open and people rush out . 
For a few minutes after that , the situation was so confusing , that Justin was in danger of being crushed , and Nick's Headbutt had been trampled on . 
Harry stood up against the wall as if pinned to it , while the teachers tried to scold the pupil to keep order . 
Professor McGonagall came running , behind her was a class of followers , some people also carry the striped black hair striped white stripes . 
The professor used a wand to knock a loud explosion that kept everyone safe . 
At that time , the professor ordered everyone to return to the classroom . 
Soon everyone was relaxed , just as Ernie of the Hufflepuffs ran up to one , gasping for breath . 
His face was white , his fingers pointing directly at Harry , and it screamed dramatically : 
- Getting caught in battle ! 
Professor McGonagall said , 
- okay , Ernie . 
Peeves are still swinging above everyone's heads . 
He probed the situation , grinning coyly . 
Peeves always enjoy chaotic scenes . 
As the teachers bent down to look at Justin and Nick's Headbutt , Peeves bellowed : 
- Oh , Potter , what the hell did you do ? 
Kill the students , it is likely that you enjoy the company . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Enough , Peeves ! 
The goblin stepped back , but still tried to stick his tongue mocking Harry . 
Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Department of Astronomy justin to the clinic , but no one knows how to do with Nick Nears Head . 
Finally , Professor McGonagall snapped one finger , taking from the air a huge fan . 
The professor gives Ernie the fan , instructing him how the lightweight fan is going to take Nick Sneak Head down the stairs . 
Ernie followed the instructions , the Nick Sizzler fan slammed his head slowly forward like a ghostly smoke , black and silent . 
Follow me , Harry . 
So there was only Harry left with Professor McGonagall . 
The professor said : 
- Follow me , Harry . 
Harry said , 
" My daughter , I swear I'm not 
Professor McGonagall murmured , 
- This is beyond my range , Harry ! 
They quietly stepped around a corner of the corridor , coming in front of a huge gutter of stone carving an extremely ugly beast . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Lemon candy ! 
Obviously this was a password , because the stone beast suddenly came alive , jumped one by one , and the wall behind it split in half . 
Though scared to worry about what had just happened , Harry was still amazed . Behind the wall is a smooth spiral staircase that moves upward , like an automatic escalator . 
As he followed Professor McGonagall inside , Harry heard the wall slamming shut behind him . 
Two people were raised in a spiral , higher and higher , until Harry felt a bit dizzy before he saw in front of him a smooth , oak door with bronze door knob in the shape of a lion head bird . It is the eagle mastermind , the symbol of the Gryffindor . 
Now Harry knew where he was being taken . 
This is where Dumbledore lives . 
Chapter 12 : PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS 
Harry and Professor McGonagall stepped out of the stone steps , and Professor McGonagall knocked on the door . 
The door quietly opened , both entered . 
The professor told Harry to wait , then left it alone . 
Harry looked around . 
Certainly : Among all the teachers ' offices that Harry had stepped into , Dumbledore's office was the most interesting . 
If he was not in a state of anxiety about being thrown out of school , he would have been glad to take that opportunity to visit Dumbledore's private place . 
It is a spacious round room , full of funny sounds . 
A strange set of silver tools straddled the feet , stingling , clattering and spraying small clusters of smoke . 
The walls are full of portraits of the principal and the former principal of Hogwarts . 
All of them are drowsy in the picture frame . 
There was a giant desk , with claws in it . Behind that desk was a shelf , and on top of it was a wicked hats : a sorting hat . 
Harry hesitated . 
He glanced around a sorcerer's waning portrait on the wall . 
If he tried to put a hat on his head again , it would not hurt . 
Just to try to make sure that the hat has arranged it in the wrong dormitory , not to confuse anything . 
Harry walks around the desk quietly , lifts the hat off the shelf , and then puts the hat on his head . 
The hat was too big for the head to fall down to cover his eyes , just like before , when he first put the hat on his head . 
He gazed at the dark space inside the hat and waited . 
A small voice echoed in his ear : 
- what is the melancholy thing Potter ? 
Harry whispered : 
- Yes , sorry to bother you , I just want to ask 
The hat said brightly : 
- I wonder if I put him in the dorm right ? 
Rub is special , very difficult to classify . 
But we still keep our original ideas . 
Harry's heart fluttered . said the hat : 
- If you go to Slytherin , you will be able to use your talent 
Harry felt his stomach slip out of his stomach . 
He took the tip of the hat out . 
The old , worn out shoe , shaking in his hand . 
Harry ordered the hat on the shelf to feel sick . 
She said loudly to the silent hat : 
- You're wrong ! 
The hat is not eager to move . 
His eyes were dull and his hair fell off , even when Harry looked at it . 
Harry stepped back , still staring at the hat . 
Suddenly from behind it resounded a strange sound at a strange time , causing it to immediately turn around . 
It turned out not only alone in the room . Behind the door there was a golden branch , and the beanstalk on the tree was an old bird that looked like a turkey half sickly . 
Harry glared at the bird and the bird responded with a glare , continuing to sound the other way around . 
Harry saw this bird seems too sick . 
His eyes were dull and his hair fell off , even when Harry looked at it . 
Harry briefly thought that there was only a shortage of Dumbledore's penguin dying while in the room , alone with him , just then , the bird suddenly exploded . 
Harry screamed in horror and jumped back from the desk . 
He looked around for a glass of water , but did not see anything . 
Meanwhile , the bird became a fireball . 
The ball hissed loudly and disappeared for a second , leaving only a pile of ashes on the floor . 
The office door opened . 
Dumbledore stepped in , looking sad . 
Harry gasped and said , 
- Teacher , bird in the room he does not do anything natural it burns 
Dumbledore smiled , making Harry astonished . 
He said : 
- It's time . 
Some days it looks too scary . 
He told her to burn it off . 
Harry's thick face made Dumbledore delight . 
Explained : 
- Fawkes is a phoenix , Harry . 
When it comes to death , the phoenix burns and is reborn from its ashes . 
Looks like 
Harry looked down , just as a young , wrinkled , tiny baby chick was poking his head out of the ashes . 
This new bird looks as ugly as an old bird . 
Dumbledore sat down behind the desk : 
- The bad thing is that I saw it on the day of cremation . 
Actually it is beautiful day on weekdays , with great feathers of gold and red . 
Phoenix are wonderful creatures . 
They can carry very heavy , but their tears have the power to revive . 
New Phoenix is ​​ truly a loyal follower . 
In a panic about the Fawkes burning , Harry forgot his story . 
But as Dumbledore sat down on the stool behind his desk and stared at Harry with his blue eyes , scowling and scowling , he remembered why he had been brought here . 
However , before Dumbledore uttered the words , the door of the office was opened with a very strong thrust , and Hagrid rushed into the room , his eyes wide , his hat covered with black hair . and the rooster's body was still dangling in his large hand . 
He said dumbly to Dumbledore : 
" The culprit is not Harry , Professor Dumbledore . 
I was still talking to him just seconds before the boy was attacked ; It does not have enough time to do it , sir 
Dumbledore was about to say something , but Hagrid kept his mouth shut , his hands roaming the rooster's cheeks , causing the chicken feathers to fly everywhere . 
- It can not be Harry , sir , I am willing to swear under the Ministry of Magic if I have to . 
- Uncle Hagrid , me 
- You caught the culprit wrong , sir , I know Harry never 
- Uncle Hagrid ! 
Dumbledore was forced to say : 
- I did not say that Harry attacked them . 
- Reason ? 
Hagrid froze , his grip on the rooster's hard cock . 
He screamed down : 
- Well , sir , I ' ll wait outside . 
He was shyly stepping out . 
Dumbledore brushed the chicken feathers on the desk , Harry repeated his words hopefully : 
- Teacher , you do not think the culprit is the child , do not you ? 
- Are not . 
I do not think so . 
Dumbledore said , his expression growing sad . 
Harry waited anxiously as Dumbledore deliberated , his long fingers clasped together . 
- Still , I still want to talk to you . 
Harry waited anxiously as Dumbledore deliberated , his long fingers clasped together . 
Finally he said gently : 
- Harry , you have to ask , do you have anything to say to me ? 
Whatever . 
Harry did not know what to say . 
He thought of something Malfoy shouted : You will be the next , Mudblood ! and the pandemic was boiling in Myrtle's crying shower . 
Then he thought of the voice of the invisible man who had heard twice and remembered Ron's words : It is not a good thing to hear voices that no one else hears , even in the wizarding world . go on . 
It also thinks about what people are saying about it , and the greater fear in it is that it may have some relation with Slytherin 
But after a moment of deliberation , it said : 
- Teacher , nothing . 
The attack on Justin's victims and the ghost of Near - Death has turned the existing tension into a real terror . 
Strange one , people are worried about the fate of ghosts Nearer Missing more than Justin's condition . 
People ask each other what can cause such a thing to happen to a ghost , the terrible power that can even kill a dead man from the eight generations . 
Fortunately , the Christmas holiday was approaching , students clamored to book a seat on the Hogsmeade Express to go holiday with the family . 
Ron said to Harry and Hermione : 
- To this country , only we left school . 
We're with the Malfoys , Crabbe and Goyle . 
This holiday then glad to know ! 
Crabbe and Goyle also signed up at school during the Christmas season , because they both did what Malfoy did . 
But Harry was glad that most of the other students were home . 
He was so tired of the scene that people were avoiding him away from him in the corridor , as if he was about to open his fangs or poisoned . 
And he was fed up with the whispers and whistles as he passed by . 
However , Fred and George found it all very funny . 
Two lemons lined the front of Harry to open the door and shout : 
- Avoid the way for Slytherin's Successor , the wicked true witch is traveling here ! 
Percy strongly opposed that action . 
I coldly scolded two children : 
- this is not a joke . 
Fred shakes his hand : 
" Oh , leave the road , Mr. Percy . 
Harry is in a hurry . 
George added : 
- yes , it must go to the Chamber of Secrets to drink tea with hands and feet full of poison ! 
Ginny was not at all interested in the joke . 
Every time Fred asked Harry if he was going to attack the next one , or when George faked the evil of Harry with a garlic , Ginny cried miserably : 
- Oh , no ! 
Harry did not bother . 
At least it felt more comfortable seeing Fred and George view the rumor that it was Slytherin's successor that was crappy . 
But the jokes of Fred and George seem to have irritated Draco Malfoy , every time he saw that funny Fred brother , Malfoy looks more and more sour . 
Ron concludes : 
- It is because it only wants out that it invites itself as successor . 
You know , what he hates most is defeated in anything . 
Now that the fame of the dirty stuff he did then Harry again , so why not ? 
Said Hermione , 
- Not too long ! 
Nearly complete fluid . 
We are about to get the truth from someone already . 
At the end of the semester , the castle is engulfed in a deep calm like a thick layer of snow on top . 
Harry realizes that the castle is quiet and not the moon , and that what he likes best is that Hermione and the Weasley brothers are all Gryffindors , which means they can play with guns . I do not mind bothering anyone , I put on the practice of two hands separate . 
Fred , George and Ginny chose to stay in school instead of going to see Mr. Bill Weasley in Egypt . 
Percy did not approve of their behavior - the behaviors he considered childish - so he was rarely present in the Gryffindor common room . 
He told the kids a little bit of the swagger that he stayed at school this Christmas because his mission was to support the teachers in this difficult time . 
Christmas day is white and cool . 
Harry and Ron are the only two left in the bedroom . 
The two woke up as Hermione ran into the room . 
She dressed up fine , handing gifts to both friends . 
Hermione pulled the window and shouted : 
- Get up ! 
Ron raised his hands to cover the dazzling light , grumble : 
- Hermione , you are not allowed here 
But Hermione threw Ron a past , cheerfully said : 
- Happy Christmas ! 
I've been awake for half an hour , adding a few drops of winged flies . 
Now the medicine is ready ! 
Harry sat up , suddenly awake : 
- Maybe no ? 
- Sure ! 
She pushed the Scabbers so that she could sit down at the bottom of Ron's bed . 
- If we want to try , then I can say tonight . 
At that moment , Hedwig rushed into the room , taking a small package of beak . 
As Hedwig landed on Harry's bed , Harry happily said : 
- Strong man ? 
Will you talk to me again ? 
The owl ruffles Harry's ear in a loving way , as if it was a better gift than what he brought to Harry so much . 
That turned out to be the gift of aunt Dursley . 
Did they send Harry a toothpick with a letter telling him he could stay at Hogwarts all summer ? 
Harry's other Christmas presents make him happier . 
Hagrid gave Harry a box of honey candy , a soft candy , but Harry decided that it was a little too flammable to eat . 
Ron gave Harry a book of interesting facts about the Quidditch team he most admired , a book called Bay with a cannon . 
Hermione gave Harry a feathered eagle feather with great luxury . 
When Harry opened his last gift , he saw a Mrs. Weasley knitting needle and a large plum cake . 
He read Mrs. Weasley's Christmas greeting card with a resounding remorse for remembering Mr. Weasley's car . ( The car that after the battle clash with Lieu Roi until now still obscured ) . 
He also thinks about breaking the rules that he and Ron are about to join . 
Nobody is happy about the Christmas party at Hogwarts , even the ones who are plotting to test the horrible macaques . 
The Hall was decorated extremely magnificent . 
Not counting a dozen Christmas snow - covered fir trees and bunches of vase and flower bouquets all over the ceiling ; The hallway is also home to soft snow , light snows , warm and dry , falling from the ceiling . Dumbledore chanted some of his favorite Christmas songs . 
Hagrid laughed loudly , as loudly as possible after each white wine whisked in . 
Fred made Percy's leader's badge into the head , which Percy did not notice , so keep on wondering and asking at the boys to giggle . 
Harry did not bother about Malfoy sitting across the Slytherin tables loudly commenting on his new sweater . 
If Harry were lucky , then the Malfoy would have had a proper blow . 
Harry and Ron had not finished eating the third Christmas cake , and Hermione had slipped them out of the Hall to carry out their plot that night . 
Hermione said very coldly , in fact , as if she was going to send two children to the market to buy detergent : 
- We still need some of the one we want to turn into . 
So you two must find something for Crabbe and Goyle ; These guys are Malfoy's best friends , and Malfoy can tell the whole story . And I must also calculate that the two Crabbe and Goyle can not appear at the right time we are exploiting Malfoy . 
Harry and Ron's face was slightly blurry , but Hermione did not care , continued to present his plan meticulously , thoughtfully : 
She brought out two chocolate cakes 
- I was all laid down . 
She raised two chocolate cakes , continued : 
- I was filled with simple sleeping charms two cookies . 
You just have to make Crabbe and Goyle discover two cakes . 
They are very hungry , how they are also fast . Wait for them to sleep , the two of you spit their hair , and then drag them to the room for them to stay in the room . 
Ron and Harry looked at each other suspiciously . 
- Hermione , I do not believe it 
- Unfortunately , there is something wrong 
But Hermione's gaze flickered in a gleam of light that was no strangling to Professor McGonagall's eyes . 
She said sternly : 
- Without Crabbe and Goyle's hair , our medication was useless . 
Do you want to investigate Malfoy ? 
Harry hurriedly said : 
- okay then . 
But what about you ? 
Who do you charge the hair ? 
Hermione freshly scooped up a small bottle in her pockets and held up a pair of hairs for the two of them . 
- I've got it ! 
Do you remember Millicent Bulstrode fighting with him at the Double Club ? 
When he twisted his neck , it made his hair on his shirt . 
It's going to be Christmas Eve . - It's finished , it's just talking to the Slytherins that they've changed their mind , come back to celebrate with them . 
After saying this , Hermione ran to check that the drug was ready . 
Ron turned to look at Harry with extremely dark face : 
- Have you ever heard of a plan that is so hollow ? 
But it turned out that the first stage of the operation was as smooth as Hermione's , so much so that Harry and Ron cried out in surprise . 
They sneaked into the empty hallway after the Christmas Tea Party to wait for Crabbe and Goyle . 
Only two Slytherins are lining up for the fourth ice cream cake . 
Harry left the chocolate cake in the corridor . 
Upon seeing Crabbe and Goyle starting out of the Hall , Harry and Ron ran away behind the armor that stood near the front door . 
Seeing Crabbe excitedly pointing to Goyle's buns and running to catch him , Ron whispered : 
- We are stupid now ! 
The two Slytherins grinned and stared at the croissant mouth wide open like crocodile mouth . 
Then they chewed , smiled triumphantly over the face . 
But just a moment later , the two of them , with no change in their face , rolled to sleep on the floor . 
The hardest part of the job is dragging Crabbe and Goyle into the other side of the Hall . 
After pressing the two of us in warmth in a bucket of pots and mops , Harry extracted the hard hair like a pig hair over Goyle's forehead , and Ron pulled up Crabbe's hair . 
They even grab the shoes of the other two , because the shoes are too small for Crabbe and Goyle's legs . 
Finished , they withdrew to the bathroom of ghosts crying Myrtle , heart still not shocked about his new work . 
Both of them did not see heaven and earth because of the crying Myrtle crying in the shower of smoke from the cauldron that Hermione was stirring . 
Pulling the shirt over his face , Harry and Ron tapped the door lightly : 
- Hermione ? 
There was a click of the lock and Hermione poked her head out , her face bright and she looked nervous . 
They could hear the bubbling effervescent of bubbles in the cauldron behind Hermione . 
Three large glass cups are available on the toilet lid . 
Hermione breathlessly said : 
- Can you get anything ? 
Harry showed Hermione some of Goyle's hair . 
Hermione said : 
- All right ! 
She gives a small package : 
- I have stolen these things in the laundry room . 
You need bigger clothes once you turn into Crabbe and Goyle . 
Carefully look at the multi - fluid drug look like thick black mud sluggish . 
The three of them looked at the cauldron . 
Carefully look at the multi - fluid drug look like thick black mud sluggish . 
Hermione to this time also seems tense . 
She was anxious to read the crumpled pages of the book . 
- Surely I did the right thing . 
Books like the picture when I take the drug then it is exactly one hour after I return to the old shape . 
Whispered Ron , 
- Now what ? 
Her hand shuddered into the first glass of Bulstrode's baby hair in a tiny bottle . 
- We divide the medicine into three glasses , then put the hair in each cup . 
Hermione scooped up the large black stuff like a glass of glass . 
Finished , her trembling hands poured into the first glass of Bulstrode's tiny hair contained in a tiny bottle . 
The medicine hissed like a boiling kettle and bubbly like crazy . 
A second later , the medicine turned into a disgusting yellow . 
Ron looked at the golden substance : 
- The meaning , the essence of Bulstrode . 
Fishing is to taste the harsh tone . 
Hermione said : 
- Give your hairless hair a go . 
Harry dropped Goyle's hair in the middle of the cup , and Ron dropped Crabbe's hair into the last glass . 
Both glasses hiss and bubbly . 
Goyle's hair is light yellow in the nose , while Crabbe's hair is dull brown . 
When each of them brought up a cup , Harry said , 
- Wait . 
We should not drink here when we turn into Crabbe and Goyle , standing there will not be enough . 
Bulstrode is not very small . 
Ron agrees : 
- Indeed . 
Each one in a toilet . 
It unlocked . 
Harry carefully held his cup so as not to drop any drops of pandanus , stepping lightly in the chamber in the middle . 
It calls out : 
- Are you ready ? 
- One two Three . 
Clutching his nose , Harry swallowed two for his glass . 
The taste is not bad , roughly like stewed cabbage only . 
But immediately , his body was writhing , as if he had swallowed a bunch of deadly snakes . 
It doubles up , do not know if you are about to vomit ? Then a burning sensation spread rapidly in his stomach , spreading to each of his fingers and toes . 
Next , he gasped , crawling on the floor , feeling scary 
his body is melting , when the skin on his body blistered , stretching like hot wax . 
And he saw his hands spread out , his fingers trembling , his nails growing , his knuckles knuckled into the knob . 
His shoulders are also painfully wide , and the tingling sensation on his forehead makes it understand that his hair is spreading down his brow . 
The legs also ached in oversized shoes . 
But suddenly , just like in the beginning , all the pain ended . 
Harry lay face down on the cold stone floor , listening to the crying Myrtle crying at the back of the room . 
He threw his shoes out of his leg and stood up . 
Turns out , making Goyle is like this . 
His trembling hand was shaking as he took off his short slacks to half his calves to put on another shirt , and then went on the big shoes like Goyle's . 
It tried to pull the hair down before his forehead , but only caught the coarse short hair growing near his forehead . 
Then he noticed that his close - up glasses made his eyes dim , because it was clear that Goyle's eyes needed no glasses . 
He took out the glass , called out : 
- How are you two ? 
Goyle's voice escaped from Harry's throat . 
At the chamber on his right , Crabbe's voice echoed : 
- Accomplished . 
Harry opened the door , stepped forward in front of the cracked mirror . 
Goyle glared at him with deep , dim eyes . 
Harry scratched his ear , and Goyle in the mirror did the same . 
They both looked at each other 
The door to Ron's room opened . 
Both of them looked at each other . 
Ron looked like a Crabbe , from the coconut shark's head to the two gorilla's long arms , except that it was a little pale in shock . 
Ron walked up to the nose of the nose , exclaiming , 
- Unbelievable ! 
This is unbelievable ! 
Harry loosened the strap of the watch that was clasping Goyle's large wrist . 
- We have to go now . 
We do not know where the Slytherin common room is . 
I pray for someone to follow me 
Ron stared at Harry , saying , 
" Really , look at Goyle thinking it looks weird . 
He banged on Hermione's shower door and called : 
- Hurry up ! 
We have to go now . 
A back - to - back voice : 
- I thought I could not go anywhere . 
You have to go without me to go along . 
- Hermione , we know that Bulstrode is ugly , you do not worry about people know you 
- Not really , I would not go . 
You two go quickly , lest time wasted . 
Harry looked at Ron , bewildered . 
Shouted Ron : 
- That's Goyle's face . 
Your face is exactly like Goyle's face when the teacher calls it up . 
Harry asked through the door : 
- Are you alright , Hermione ? 
- No , I'm fine , go away . 
Harry looked at his watch . 
They have tickled out for five minutes in the precious 60 minutes they had when the drug was effective . 
He said : 
- So we will come back to you here . 
Harry and Ron scoffed at the door of the women's toilet , watching before opening and then sneaking out . 
Harry whispered to Ron : 
- do not hit the arms like that . 
- Huh ? 
- Crabbe preferred his two hands 
- Well , that looks better . 
They went down the marble steps . 
Now they did not expect anything more than to meet a Slytherin to go to the Slytherin common room , but look around and see no ghosts . 
Harry whispered to himself Ron : 
- Calculate ? 
Ron nodded toward the entrance to the basement : 
- Slytherins often come to eat breakfast from there . 
He opened his mouth and saw a curly , long - haired girl appear at the entrance to the basement . 
Ron ran after her : 
- Sorry for asking a bit . 
I forgot the way of our common room . 
Rocky girl : 
- Our common room ? 
Sorry ! 
I'm at Ravenclaw's house ! 
She walked away , still throwing her back at the suspicious look . 
Harry and Ron hurried down the rocky stairs leading into the dark corridors , their footsteps sounding loud as Crabbe and Goyle's pounding feet hit the floor . 
They began to feel that false pretenses were not as easy as they thought . 
The corridor of the maze is dark and empty . 
They just go down , down the mud , down below Hogwarts Castle , just watch the clock watch how much time they still have . spent fifteen minutes , the two children are disappointed . 
Suddenly , a sudden sound comes in front of them . 
Ron thrilled : 
- that , after all , to find a child ! 
That girl from a lonely room came out . 
But as they rushed to that place , their heart sank : it was not a Slytherin they expected , but it was Brother Percy . 
Asked Ron , 
- What are you doing here ? 
Percy seems offended : 
- Nothing to do with the game . 
Are you Crabbe ? 
Ron paused one but replied in time : 
- That's right 
Percy sternly said : 
- Then go to your bedroom right away . 
These days wandering in dark corridors is not safe at all . 
- But you 
Ron rebuked , but Percy stood up and said , 
- I'm the leader . 
Nothing dared to attack me . 
A voice came from Ron and Harry . 
They turned around and saw Malfoy coming . This was the first time in his life that Harry was glad to see Malfoy . 
Malfoy looked at the two of them , 
- We're here . 
Have you been hungry in the Great Hall since now ? 
I'm going to find them now , this is great I want to see them now . 
Malfoy glanced at Percy in disdain : 
- What are you doing here , Weasley ? 
Percy : 
- You must respect a Leader ! 
I do not like the attitude of the game at all ! 
Malfoy smiled contemptuously and signaled to Harry and Ron to follow him . 
Harry almost apologized to Percy , who fortunately controlled himself . 
He and Ron hurried to Malfoy . 
As he turned to another corridor , Malfoy said : 
- Peter Weasley 
Ron automatically fixes : 
- Percy . 
Malfoy : 
- What is the name of the body ! 
I noticed this guy stalking around here . 
I'm with you now that I know what he wants . 
He thought it was only one hand to catch his successor Slytherin ? 
Malfoy laughed sarcastically . 
Harry and Ron glanced at each other nervously . 
Malfoy stopped in front of a damp stone wall . 
He asked Harry : 
- What is the new password ? 
Harry : 
- E 
Malfoy does not care about Harry's voice ( which has transformed into Goyle ) . 
She remembered the password : 
- Well , remember Blood in ! 
The stone door hiding in the open wall . 
Malfoy walks straight in , Harry and Ron follow him . 
The common room of the Slytherin House is a long , low , underground room , stone wall , ceiling is also paved stone , hanging each string of light round pale blue light . 
A flame was fluttering in an ornately carved furnace , casting some Slytherin sneakers on the high backrest that surrounded it . 
Malfoy led Harry and Ron to a pair of empty seats away from the fireplace , telling them : 
- We are here waiting . 
I will go get married for them - Ba ba has just arrived 
Malfoy returned , holding out something like a cut newspaper . 
Harry and Ron sat down on the couch , wondering what Percy was going to do for himself , while trying his best to be as comfortable as he was at home . 
Just a moment later , Malfoy returned , holding something like a cut - off . 
He handed it to Ron , and said , 
- Let us laugh now . 
Harry saw Ron's eyes startled , tried to read the newspaper quickly , tried to laugh , then gave the article to Harry . 
That article was cut from the Prophet Daily , with the following content : 
EXCITING IN THE MINISTRY OF LAW 
Today , Arthur Weasley , Muggle's Mentalist , has been fined 50 Galleons for having sprained a Muggle car . 
Lucius Malfoy , board member of the Hogwarts School for Magic and Magic , where the car was spellbound , has crashed earlier this school year , calling for Mr. Weasley to step down . 
Lucius Malfoy told reporters : " Weasley has scandalized the Ministry of Magic . 
He is clearly unfit to enforce our rules , and so his humorous Muggle Protection Act should be dismissed immediately . 
We could not reach Mr. Weasley to hear his opinion , but his wife said the envoy announced that it was time for her to drop her maid in the house ! 
When Harry returned the note , Malfoy asked impatiently : 
- Star ? 
Are we happy now ? 
Harry bitterly brushed his teeth : 
- Hm . 
Malfoy shouted out : 
- Arthur Weasley liked the Muggles so much that he could not break his old wand and run after them . 
Looking at the way the Weasley house , it is hard to say that they are the pureblood . 
Ron's face - or the fact that it was Crabbe's face - was distorted by the restraining anger . 
Cried Malfoy , 
- What's wrong with you , Crabbe ? 
Ron : 
- stomach ache . 
Malfoy laughed hysterically : 
- Then you went down to the sick room and kicked the Muggles one by one for me . 
You know , I wonder why the Prophet Daily has not reported any attacks today . 
He went on to say with a thought : 
- I guess Dumbledore was trying to get the hang of those things . 
If that sort of thing but also continue , he will lose his job and be thrown away immediately . 
My dad still says that old Dumbledore is the worst thing ever in this school . 
He also enjoyed the Muggle family . 
To be sure , a decent principal would have left that creevey - like slimy paste in place ! 
Malfoy began to pretend to be shooting with a fictitious and imaginative camera , but completely accurate . Colin's impressive image : 
- Brother Potter , you take pictures of him , Brother Potter ? 
Give me your autograph ? 
Do you lick your shoes , Potter ? 
But it fell down , looking at Harry and Ron : 
- What are the two now ? 
Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh , somewhat later , in response to Malfoy's antics . 
Still , Malfoy seemed pleased . 
Probably , Crabbe and Goyle are losing their jokes this week . 
Malfoy continues : 
- St . Potter's living , Mudblood's friend ! 
Just a lack of proper sense of witch , but it is not conscious that it did not hit you with the Mudblood birth like Hermione . 
So that people thought it was Slytherin's successor ! 
Harry and Ron anxiously waited for him to say : surely , just a little more , Malfoy revealed to them that he was the successor . 
But then Malfoy said : 
- I know who that person is for me to help one hand . 
Ron's jaw dropped , leaving Crabbe to look duller than usual . 
Fortunately Malfoy did not notice . 
Harry asked quickly : 
- But he probably guessed who was behind the scenes 
Malfoy crossed the line : 
" You know I do not know Goyle ! 
How many times have I told you ? 
My dad did not tell me anything about the Secret Chamber opened last time . 
Of course , what happened fifty years ago was before his time . 
He was sure he knew it , but he must keep it private ; I know that too much , sometimes people are suspicious of me . 
But at least I know one thing : The last time the Secret Chamber was opened was a dead Mudblood . 
So , I'm not too fast now , how could this one of them have been killed ? I hope it will be a hated Hermione . 
Malfoy's pleading tone made Ron clench Crabbe's big hand into a fist . 
Harry felt that everything would be ruined if Ron could not control himself and put a punch in Malfoy's face , and he glared at Ron and said , 
- According to the great anime , whether people have opened the Chamber of Secrets last time yet ? 
Malfoy said : 
- Yes , whoever is gone is also expelled . 
Maybe they are still in Azkaban now . 
Harry asked again . 
- Azkaban do ? 
Malfoy looked at it , could not believe it : 
- Azkaban - the witch of Azkaban any more Goyle ? 
To be honest , you just slow down a little bit more as you hold your brows down . 
Unscrambled on his chair , Malfoy continued : 
" Let me show you a little patience and leave your successor to Slytherin . " 
He says Hogwarts needs to scan the Mudblood , but I do not have that . 
Of course , he had enough crap now . 
Do you know that the Ministry of Magic just checked my manor last week ? 
Harry tried to make Goyle's bored expression a concern . 
Malfoy continued chattering . 
- right . 
But fortunately they did not find anything significant . 
Ba has a number of artifacts Dark is very valuable . 
But fortunately , my house also has a secret room , just below the living room floor 
Exclaimed Ron : 
- I knew that ! 
Malfoy looked at Ron . 
Harry also looked at Ron . 
Ron is ripe red . 
Even his hair is turning red . 
The nose is also elastic . 
One hour of effective drugs in them is about to end , Ron is transformed into Ron again . 
And when he saw Ron suddenly look at him with horrified eyes , Harry understood that it was also disintegrating . 
Both stood up . 
Ron : 
- Sword pill pills look ! 
No more spending any more time , the two of them zoom into the Slytherin common room , through the stone wall , into the hallway , hoping Malfoy can not keep up with their change . 
Harry could feel his legs knitting from Goyle's huge boots and he had to pull up his loincloth to pull off his trifle as his body shrank . 
They collapsed on the steps leading up to the entrance to the Dark Hall , where there was a murmur from the corner where they had locked up Goyle and Crabbe . 
Leaving aside the big shoes of the corners , they were wearing only stockings , the two neck plugs running up the marble stairs , toward Myrtle's coyote's crying toilet . 
Ron just shut the toilet and gasped : 
- Oh , not so much that time . 
We have yet to find out who was responsible for the attacks , but tomorrow we will write a letter to investigate the secret room in the Malfoy living room . 
- Hermione , go away , we have a lot of stories told you 
Hermione moaned : 
- Get out of the way ! 
Harry and Ron looked at each other : 
- What's up ? Now you're probably back to the original shape ? 
These two 
Suddenly the ghost screamed Myrtle through a door , appearing in front of them . 
Harry had never seen a ghost crying like this . 
The ghost said : 
- Uaiiiii daaaaa , we are waiting for that now , terrible 
Ron and Harry heard the door open , and Hermione appeared , whimpering , her robes pulled up over her head . 
Harry wondered asked : 
- What happened ? 
Do you still wear the nose of Big Baby ? 
Hermione's face covered with black hair . 
Hermione let go of her robe and slipped off her head , revealing a face that even Ron was so frightened that he jumped back and fell in the washbasin : 
Hermione's face covered with black hair . 
Her eyes had changed to yellow , and her long , pointed ears pointed out her hair . 
Hermione howled painfully : 
- That strand is a cat's hair ! 
Sure Big Baby has a cat ! 
Multivariate drug for human use but not used to turn the animals ! 
Ron : 
- Death grave ! 
Ghost crying joyfully : 
- They will tease you in terror ! 
Harry said quickly : 
- That's fine , Hermione . 
We will bring you to sick room . 
Mrs. Pomfrey never wondered what was going on 
It took a long time to convince Hermione to leave the women's toilet . 
The cry of the ghost crying chasing them along the way : 
- Wait for everyone to see you have a tail to go home ! 
CHAPTER 13 : CONGRATULATIONS TO SECRETS 
Hermione had to stay for several weeks . 
When other students pulled back to school after the Christmas holiday , the absence of her made up for nothing . 
rumors of rumors . 
Of course , Hermione was attacked . 
Some of the students dragged in a long line through Hermione to find Hermione , so Pomfrey had to bring her curtains to surround Hermione's bed , giving her the embarrassed look of curious eyes . his face is full of feathers . 
How did Ron and Hermione visit Hermione ? 
When the new semester started , they brought Hermione's notebook in to the sick room . 
In the afternoon , Ron put the pile of books on the bedside table for Hermione , said : 
- Meet me , if you grow a mouse beard , then I also study well . 
But Hermione insisted : 
- do not say stupid , Ron . 
I have to keep up with my class ! 
The spirit of the girl was very good , because her face was smooth and her eyes were turning brown . 
Hermione whispered to Pomfrey not hear : 
- Do you have any new clues ? 
Harry was sad : 
- Are not . 
Ron said , there are a hundred times , not less : 
- I'm sure Malfoy is no one else ! 
Harry pointed at a piece of yellow paper poking out under Hermione's pillow , asking : 
- What is this ? 
- It's just a card 
Hermione quickly hides it , but Ron is quicker than her . 
He draws a sheet of paper , opens it and reads aloud : 
- Send Hermione the good wishes of the teacher who always cares for you , Professor Gilderoy Lockhart , Merlin Order , the third , Honorary Member of the Anti - Missile Federation , five - time winner . The most charming smile of the week of the Witch . 
Raised his head to look at Hermione , disgusted : 
- Do you kneel this thing ? 
But Hermione escaped , not responding , because then Pomfrey came in , carrying her the evening medicine . 
As he left to return to Gryffindor Tower , Ron said to Harry : 
- Have you ever met more lovers than Mr. Lockhart ? 
Snape's teacher gave them such a huge mountain of work that when Harry was not done , it felt like he had been in his sixth year . 
Ron was pretending to ask Hermione how many more moths he'd gotten in his coat , when the two of them heard an angry scream from the upper floor . 
Harry whispered : 
- Filch's voice . 
Hurry up the stairs and stop listening . 
Ron worried : 
- Do you think someone else was attacked ? 
They stood still , ears to the sound of Filch's screams , hearing as more and more as crazy more : 
- more pouring down my head ! 
Fighting all night , as if I do not have enough work to do ? 
No , too much stamina . 
This is a drop of water that overflows , I must go see Dumbledore ! 
Filch's footsteps diminished , and the two children heard the door slamming shut . 
Corner of the corridor , the two children , head to look . 
Apparently , Filch did not leave his guarding position : the place where the cat had happened had been the place where Mrs. Noris had been buried . 
They glanced at what made Filch scream . 
It turned out that a clumsy hybrids flooded the half of the corridor , apparently flowing from the crevasse under the door of the ghostly mausoleum of Myrtle . 
At this point , when no longer crying farting of Filch again , the sobs of the crying ghosts crying Myrtle came out more clearly . 
Ron wondered : 
- What is she doing now ? 
Harry said : 
- We do not care . 
Then grab the loincloth flap over the ankle to walk through the puddle , to the door wearing a small billboard with the word big : DUC CAUU HU . 
And as always , the two of us ignore the words on the board , stepping on . 
At this time the ghost crying Myrtle is crying , perhaps worse and more resentful than ever . 
It looks like the ghost is hiding under his regular tank . candles lit in the toilet was turned off by the water , black room , walls and floors are wet . 
Harry asked , 
- Myrtle , what's wrong ? 
Myrtle groaned gently : 
- Who's that ? 
What else could I throw in my head ? 
Harry approached Myrtle's toilet and said , 
- What is it that I threw something to you ? 
Myrtle roared : 
- do not ask me again ! 
Myrtle appeared , pulling the water to the ground as the floor flooded . 
- I'm just here , just hurt my pain , but people also come to throw my head in my head to present fun 
Harry said , sounding very reasonable : 
- But no matter what someone throws at you , you will not do anything . 
I mean , that only flies through you , right ? 
But it turned out to be stupid . 
Myrtle ghosts can be roared more violently : 
- Yes ! 
Just throw the book in Myrtle again , because it does not feel anything ! Lick it and hit it ten points it ! 
As well as hit the head is fifty points spoiled ! 
Wow , good fun ! 
How can I think of such a good game ? 
Harry asked : 
- But who can throw anything in her sister ? 
Myrtle glared at him : 
- I do not know I was sitting on a U - shaped pipe , thinking about death , it fell right on top of my head . 
Over there , water will be cleaned 
Harry and Ron looked at the pot that Myrtle pointed at . 
Inside there is a small and thin book . 
The book's cover was as tasteless and wet as anything in the toilet . 
Harry walked over to pick up the book , but Ron suddenly threw his arms around it . 
Harry asked : 
- What happened ? 
Ron replied : 
- Are you crazy ? 
The book can be very dangerous . 
Harry laughed : 
- Danger ? 
Come on , how can a book be dangerous ? 
Ron looked anxiously at the notebook : 
- You do not know . 
Did you tell them , at that time , in the books confiscated by the Ministry of Magic , there was a book that burned the eyes of the reader . 
There are books Poetry Wizard , who read through life and then open his mouth to say . 
There is an old witch in Bath who makes a book that anyone can pick up and can not stop reading ! 
You will always nose the book wherever you go , doing anything with just one hand to do it . 
There are again 
Harry said : 
- Okay , I got it . 
The book is still in the pot , mysterious and wet , Harry hesitates : 
- If you do not try , then know how 
He knelt past Ron to bend over to pick up the book . 
Immediately Harry realized that this was a diary , and the faint lines on the cover told him that the diary had existed fifty years ago . 
Harry opened his eyes eagerly . 
On the first page , only one name in ink has faded . 
M . Riddle . 
Ron approached cautiously and looked at Harry's shoulder . 
Ron approached cautiously and looked at Harry's shoulder . 
It exclaims : 
- Wait , I know this name . M . Riddle was awarded the Special Award fifty years ago . 
Harry was surprised : 
- How did you know that ? 
Ron recalled : 
- Filch made me brush his medallion fifty times when he was penalized for that , remember ? 
I missed the litter on the locket , and then lost the clock stick on a name stick , then I have to remember that name . 
Harry took out the wet paper . 
Every page is white . 
There is no trace of faint evidence of the words written on those pages , whether it be a regular note like Aunt Mabel's birthday or a dentist appointment at three and a half hours . 
Harry did not hide his disappointment : 
- He does not write anything in this . 
Curious Ron : 
- I do not know why some people want to throw it in the toilet ? 
Harry flipped the back of his diary and saw the name of a department store in Vauxhall Street , London . 
Harry thought impatiently : 
He bought a diary at a shop on Vauxhall Street . 
Maybe he came from a Muggle family . 
Said Ron : 
- Yeah , but nothing to do . 
Hearing Harry's ear , Ron whispered , 
- Try to hit the ghost nose wailing myrtle Myrtle , that is fifty points . 
However , Harry had left the diary in his pocket . 
In early February Hermione left the sick room , the tail was broken , the beard fell , the face was smooth . The first night she returned to Gryffindor Tower , Harry gave her a treat for her diary . Riddle and tell her how she found the diary . 
Hermione eagerly holds up the diary , scrutinizing : 
" Oh , sure , it must have contained some power . 
Ron : 
- If it is , then it must be hidden very carefully . 
It's so embarrassing . 
Harry , I do not understand why you do not throw it away . 
Harry said : 
- I wish I knew why someone tried to throw it away . 
I would also like to know what Riddle was rewarded for Hogwarts . 
Ron is not very excited : 
- What does not work ? 
He may be thirty . 
W . L [ ( short for Ordinary Wizarding Level , a trophy after passing the test series at the end of the fifth year . 
Called a Normal Witch ) ] or saved a teacher from the hose of a giant squid . 
Or did he assassinate Myrtle ? Do it as a special merit 
But based on Hermione's frown , Harry was sure she was thinking of what she was thinking . 
Ron looked up at Hermione's face and asked , 
- Well , Malfoy says the Confidential Chamber was opened fifty years ago , right ? 
- Ừ 
Ron nodded slowly . 
Hermione tapped her fingers nervously on the diary : 
- And this diary was written fifty years ago . 
- So what ? 
- Oh , Ron , where's your mind ? 
Hermione gritted her tongue . 
- We know that the man who opened the Secret Chamber the previous time was expelled fifty years ago . 
We know T . M . Riddle was awarded a special scholarship to Hogwarts School fifty years ago . 
Well , then , Riddle was rewarded for having succeeded in capturing the Slytherin heir . 
Maybe his diary can tell me everything - where the secret holds where , for example , and how to open it ? 
What monsters live in it ? 
It was the one who had masterminded some recent attacks who did not want to see the diary stuck here , right ? 
Ron nodded . 
- that is an excellent hypothesis that Hermione . 
There is only one detail in the diary : there is no writing at all . 
Hermione withdrew the wand from her briefcase . 
Little girl said : 
- It may be written in invisible ink . 
Hermione knocked her chopsticks over her diary three times , reading the mantra : 
- Aparecium ! [ ( Appearing out ) ] 
Nothing appears . Without hesitating , Hermione stuffed her wand into a pair , and pulled out one like a red glaze . 
She said : 
- this is the Grom disclosed , I bought in the alley . 
She rubbed the gum on the 1 January . 
Also does not show anything . 
Ron said , 
- I told you , there is nothing to find in the diary as a Christmas gift , but then there is nothing to write nothing in it . 
Harry could not even explain , even to himself , why he would not throw away Riddle's diary . 
One thing is that even though Harry knew the diary had no words , he kept ignoring the notebook and turning pages , as if there was a story that he wanted to read . 
And though Harry was certain he had never heard of T . M . Riddle , but that name still seems to mean something to him , almost as if Riddle was a childhood friend of hers , but he still remembered to carry the trough . 
But that sounded too cheesy . 
Before entering Hogwarts , Harry had no friends at all , since Dudley's cousin did not want anyone to play with Harry . 
Still , Harry was determined to learn more about Riddle . 
The next day during the play , went to the Traditional Room to see the special donkey Riddle was rewarded . 
Along with it , Hermione is excited to discover and Ron is completely reluctant . 
Ron said to his two friends that he had seen the Traditional Room enough , enough for his whole life to see it again . 
Riddle's shiny golden locket is stored in a corner cabinet . 
There is no detail on where Riddle was awarded . ( Ron said : Fortunately . 
But if you list the achievement , then the eagle is bigger and sure to hit the nail polish that time . ) But they found the name Riddle was written on a medallion of old magic , and on the list of male students also named Riddle . 
Ron wrinkled his nose uncomfortably : 
- This guy looks like Percy . He's also the leader , the Nam Linh , and probably the most in every subject . 
Said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice : 
- Why did you say it was so bad ? 
The sun began to shine above Hogwarts . 
The situation is brighter , more and more hopeful . 
No more attacks , since Justin and Nick Nearhead have been petrified . 
Ms . Pomfrey was pleased to report that the temperament of the ginseng was becoming more erratic and cramped , meaning that they were growing up , no longer children . 
One afternoon , Harry heard Pomfrey kindly tell Filch : 
- When they run out of acne , it is possible to replace the pots again . 
After that , picking is complete and then take a stew . 
Sooner or later Mrs. Noris will recover . 
Harry thought Slytherin's successor was scared . 
Now , when the whole school began to doubt and vigilantly oppose the opening of the Chamber of Secrets , it became a desperate act . 
Maybe the monster , or whatever , now lies down to prepare to sleep a long fifty years 
But Ernie , a Hufflepuff student , still does not seem very optimistic . 
He remains convinced that Harry is a criminal , that Harry has revealed the truth at the Double Club . 
Peeves do not make the problem better . 
He danced to the crowd gathering in the corridor and sang out : O Potter , rotten things , later on his song is illustrated by the dance also . 
Gilderoy Lockhart seems to have put an end to the attacks alone . 
Once , when the Gryffindor students were waiting in the classroom , Harry overheard the conversation between Lockhart and Professor McGonagall . 
Brother Lockhart said : 
- I'm sure there will be no more trouble . 
He knocked on his nose and winked at his understanding : 
- I suppose the door to the Secret Chamber was locked permanently . 
The culprit must know that sooner or later will be grabbed by my neck . 
So it's hard to stop now , lest I be heavy with it . 
What we need now is a trigger - spirit . to blow off . 
Clear out the bad impression of the last semester go ! 
I can not say anything yet , but I already have a plan 
Lockhart knocked on his nose and strode away . 
At breakfast on February 14 , Lockhart's idea of ​​ a mental activation became apparent . The night before , Harry could not sleep much because of Quidditch training late . 
He woke up late , down the Great Hall after everyone . 
When entering the Hall , it was thought that he had gone to the wrong place . 
The walls were full of large pink flowers . 
The paper heart is falling like rain from the blue ceiling . 
Harry went to Gryffindor's table . 
For that , Ron was sitting with his face as if he wanted to , and Hermione could not seem to stop laughing . 
Harry sat down , flipping the paper flower over his bacon , asking : 
- What's going on ? 
Ron pointed his finger at the teacher's desk , obviously bored to the point of speaking . 
Mr. Lockhart was waving to keep everyone quiet . 
He wore a pink blouse to match the color of the decor . 
The other teachers sat on either side of him wearing a rocky face . 
From where he sat , Harry could see Professor McGonagall's cheekbone thrust outward from his muscular face . 
And Snape's teacher brought a face of a person who had a sore throat in his mouth . 
Lockhart shouted : 
- Happy Valentine's Day ! 
And allow me to thank forty - six people , to this day , sent me a greeting card . 
Yes , I volunteered this fun to give you a pleasant surprise - and not yet ! 
Mr. Lockhart clapped his hands , and a dozen dumbfucked elves from the hallway stepped through the door into the Great Hall . 
Not the ordinary dwarfs ! 
Mr. Lockhart gave all the elves wings and hugged the harp . 
Brother Lockhart said brightly : 
- these are the cute love gods go hand out cards ! 
Today , these love deities will go all over the campus to wish you good luck ! 
And it's not over yet ! 
I am sure my colleagues will take this opportunity to get some talent . 
Why do not you try to ask Snape to spread a love drug ? 
While Snape prepared the great medicine , Professor Flitwick would show that he knew more about the Magic than any other magician I had ever met , the rightful old dog ! 
Professor Flitwick buried his head in his hands . 
Snape looked at him as if he would stuff poison for any child who dared to open his mouth for the drug . 
" Hey , Hermione , you say you are not among the forty - six admirers . " 
Hermione was naturally busy looking for a schedule in her briefcase , not saying anything . 
Throughout the day , the dwarves rushed through the classes to give the Valentine's Day greetings , exasperating the professors . 
At noon , when the Gryffindors were going upstairs to learn the Adventures , a dwarf caught up with Harry . 
Using the elbow to poke people to the road , the elf has a particularly sinister face that shouting : 
- Oh , here I am , Arry Potter . 
Terrified with the idea of ​​ being donated to a lover's card in front of the first - graders who were standing in line , including Ginny , Harry hastily hid . 
However , the dwarf still wanders through the crowd's legs and blocks Harry's path before it spins two steps . 
The flute of the harp sounds like a threat : 
- There is a music - letter to Arry Potter here . 
Harry ran away , moaning : 
- do not do it here ! 
Grub dwarf : 
- stand still ! 
He grasped Harry's bag to pull it back . 
Harry tugged at the pair , grumbling : 
- Let me go . 
A roar sounded and his pair was torn in two . 
Harry's files , wand , leather , and goose were all down on the floor and his ink jar fluttered over everything . 
Harry crawled around to retrieve his belongings before the dwarf began singing , causing traffic congestion in the corridor . 
- What is happening ? 
Malfoy's strange prolonged voice echoed . 
Harry more and more hastily packed his belongings in the tattered pair , just hope to leave soon before Malfoy listening to the song Love for her . 
Suddenly a familiar voice resounded : 
- What are you doing here ? 
Now listen to the song for you 
Brother Percy appears . 
Harry was nearly mad , trying to run away quickly , but the dwarf grabbed his knee , falling to the floor . 
Seated on Harry's ankle , the dwarf said , 
- ok then . 
Now let's listen to the song for you here : his eyes are green like a dab of duck - his hair is black like a blackboard - I wish he was mine - he was indeed a supernatural - the hero was victorious dark boss 
Harry is willing to change the amount of gold he has in Gringotts Bank to get evaporated right from here . 
Gaining the courage to laugh with all the people around him , Harry struggled to stand on his legs as he was under the weight of the dwarf . 
The leader of Percy , trying to dispel the crowds laughing , someone laughed tears . 
- Let's go , the children dissolve , the bell came to school was ringing in five minutes . go to class now ! 
Harry looked around and saw Malfoy bending over to pick up something . 
Glancing across a groan , Malfoy handed Crabbe and Goyle a look , and Harry realized immediately that Malfoy had obtained the Riddle diary . 
- Pay it ! 
Harry said coldly . 
Malfoy said : 
- to see what Harry wrote in this . 
Apparently , Malfoy did not notice the five on the cover and thought he was holding Harry's diary . 
The people around him were silent . 
Ginny glared at Harry's diary , fearful of him . 
But Percy said earnestly , 
- Malfoy , give it to Harry ! 
Malfoy still waved his diary in his hands to provoke Harry : 
- As long as I finish reading . 
Percy said : 
- As a leader 
But Harry was not calm enough . 
He withdrew the wand and shouted , 
- Expelliarmus ! [ ( Take a bauble to rinse the rat ! ) ] . 
It was no different from the way Mr. Snape disarmed Mr. Lockhart . 
Malfoy saw the diary shoot out of his hands , flying into the air . 
Ron grinned and took his hand . 
Percy shouted : 
- Harry , do not use magic in the hallway ! 
You will have to report this , do you know ? 
But Harry defied . 
He beat Malfoy 1 - 0 , and this was a mistake for the Gryffindor's five points . 
Malfoy glared madly , so when Ginny passed it to enter the classroom , he bitterly bit her face : 
" I see Harry does not love your love song . 
Ginny put her hands up to her face quickly . 
Ron pulled out his wand , but Harry quickly pulled it away . 
So Ron did not vomit again . 
Only until they reached Professor Flitwick's class , Harry noticed that the diary had something unusual : while all of his other books were more or less torn by purple ink , the diary is still white , white , stripped as if it had never been squeezed by ink . 
He was about to point Ron , but then Ron was in trouble with the wand : the purple bubbles were swirling at the ends of chopsticks as the flowers hatched , so that Ron was not interested in the attention . What else ? 
That night Harry got to bed earlier than everyone in the dorm . 
In part because it was aimed at him , it was unbearable for Fred and George to sing . 
The two men kept singing him : 
- His eyes as freshly dug 
But partly because he wanted to reconsider Riddle's diary , something he knew was a waste of time . 
Harry sat on the bed , tattooed each blank page , no page with a little ink smudges . 
Harry pulled out a new ink bottle from his bedside drawer , inked the inkpot , and put a droplet of paper in his diary . 
Drops of ink glittered on the paper for a second and then disappeared as if it were swallowed by paper . 
Harry dabbed his goose feather ink again and wrote : 
- My name is Harry Potter . 
The letter glittered on the paper for a moment and then drowned , leaving no trace . 
But , the strange thing finally happened : on paper , the words came out slowly , with Harry's purple ink , but not the words Harry had written : 
- Hello Harry Potter . 
My name is Tom Riddle . 
How did you get my diary ? 
These words also disappear as Harry begins to write : 
- Somebody threw it in the toilet and I got it . 
Then he waited impatiently for Riddle's words to appear : 
- Fortunately I kept my memory in a way that was harder to fade with ink . 
But I know there are people who do not want anyone to read this diary . 
Harry scrambled to read the new words : 
- What does that mean ? 
- I mean , this diary contains terrible memories . 
Things are buried . 
Things have happened at Hogwarts School of Magic and Magic . 
Harry writes quickly : 
- that's where I live . 
I am studying at Hogwarts School and there are many horrible things going on . Do you know anything about the Secret Chamber ? 
Harry's heart pounded . 
Riddle's reply also appeared quickly , skewed , as if he was anxious to take his heart off Harry : 
Of course I know about the Confidential Chamber . 
When I was in school , people just talked about it as a myth , not believe it was real . 
But that's a lie . 
When I was in fifth grade , the Confidential Chamber was opened and the monster attacked many students , eventually killing one . 
I caught the man who opened the secret chamber and he was kicked out . 
But the headmaster , Professor Dippet , was ashamed of what happened at Hogwarts , and forbade me to tell the truth . 
People make up a story to explain that the murdered student died of a terrible accident . 
They rewarded me with a beautiful medallion , engraved , glittering , for my special merit and for keeping my silence . 
But I knew it could happen again . 
The monster is still alive , and the monster that has the power to release the monster has not been imprisoned . 
Harry scrambled to write the answer so fast that the ink bottle upset . 
- That's happening again . There have been three attacks and no one knows who the masterminds in these cases are . 
When did the attack last ? 
Riddle's answer is : 
- I can show you if you like . 
You do not believe me , it does not matter . 
I can lead you into my memory of the night I caught him . 
Harry hesitated , his goose pen stopped in the middle of the diary . 
What is meant by Riddle ? 
How can that be put into the memory of others ? 
He glanced nervously toward the bedroom door , the sky outside dark . 
When he looked back at the diary , he saw a few new words appear : 
- let me show you . 
Harry hesitated for a moment and wrote two words : 
- agree . 
The pages are beginning to blast as quickly as they are swept up in a big wind , and then stopped in the middle of the June pages . 
With a gaping mouth , Harry stared at the square frame of June 13 [ ( in the West , superstitious Friday , June 13 was a dark , dark day ) ] seems to be turning into a transmission screen . tiny picture . 
Harry shook his diary and glared at the small screen . 
And before he knew what was going on , the screen seemed bigger and bigger as though it was drawn into it . 
Harry feels his body getting out of bed 
pushing through the open diary , into a dark realm of color and darkness . 
Then Harry found his feet on the ground . 
It stood there , shuddering , while the images of the surrounding ambient grew and made it pay close attention . 
He was reading a letter next to a candle . 
Harry knew where he was . 
This round room with drab portraits was obviously Dumbledore's office . 
But after the big desk , it was not Dumbledore himself , but a sickly old witch , and wilted , the wolf , if not the wisps of gray hair . 
He was reading a letter next to a candle . 
Harry had never seen this witch before . 
Harry stammered : 
- I'm sorry , I did not mean to rush in here , no 
But the witch never raised his head . 
He continued to read , his face a little frown , serious expression . 
Harry walked closer to the desk , cleared his throat : 
- Should I go out , teacher ? 
The witch is not paying attention to Harry . 
He did not even seem to hear what Harry said . 
Harry thought maybe the old witch was so distracted that he spoke loudly , almost shouting : 
- I'm sorry to bother you . 
Please come out soon . 
The witch put the letter back on and sighed , then stood up , passing Harry's face , which did not seem to see it . 
He moved the window up the curtain . 
The sky outside the principal's office window was flushed with rubies . 
It looks like the sunset . 
The sorcerer went back to his desk , sat down , knit his fingers together , twisted them lightly , and gazed at the door . 
Harry looked around the office . 
Without the Fawkes , there was no silverware that made all sorts of funny sounds , this was the Hogwarts of the Riddle , and the witch was the principal of that time , not the instrument . Dumbledore . 
And Harry is no longer a ghost of the future , completely invisible to those who lived fifty years ago . 
There is a knock on the door . 
The witch said in a slim voice : 
- Come in . 
The door opened , a sixteen - year - old boy came in , opened the pointed witch's hat , and on his chest was the glittering leader's badge . 
This teenager is taller than Harry , but like Harry in black hair . 
The principal said : 
- Well , Riddle . 
The Riddle looked tense : 
" Professor Dippet , do you call me ? 
Mr. Dippet said : 
- Sit down . 
Master just finished reading the letter to the teacher . 
" Yes , " said the bishop . 
- A ! 
Dear Dippet : 
" My son , maybe I can not let you go to school this summer . 
Would you like to go home for the holidays ? 
Riddle replied : 
- Teacher . 
I would love to stay at Hogwarts rather than return to that place . 
Dippet looks curious : 
- You go to the Muggle Orphanage on holidays ? 
Riddle blushed slightly : 
- Teacher , yes . 
- Parents are Muggle ? 
" My father is Muggle . 
Your mother is a witch . 
- Your parents 
- Teacher , mother died after child birth , just in time to name their son Tom , in the name of three children , and Marvolo , after the grandfather's child . 
People in the orphanage told me that . 
Dippet speaks sympathetically . 
He sighed : 
- Tom , there may be special arrangements for children , but the problem is in the present circumstances 
- Teacher , do you mean the attacks ? 
Riddle said , Harry's heart was in one hand . 
It moved closer , like fear of missing something . 
The principal said : 
- right . 
My son , you must see that I allow you to stay in the castle after the end of the school year is foolish . Especially with the recent tragedy . The death of the girl That I went to the orphanage is safer . 
In fact , the Ministry of Magic is considering the closure of Hogwarts . 
We are also close to identifying the causes of these bad things 
Riddle eyes widened . 
- Teacher , if you catch someone then it will probably end 
Mr. Dippet gave a slightly shrill cry : 
- What do you say ? 
He sat up straight on the high chair and asked : 
- Riddle , do you know something about the attacks ? 
Riddle quickly responded quickly : 
- Teacher , no . 
Harry believed that voice was like the voice he had answered Dumbledore . 
Dippet leaned back in his chair , slightly disappointed : 
- You go back , Tom . 
Riddle stood up , coming out of the room . 
Harry followed it . 
They both came down with twisted spiral stairs , coming out of the animal statue , into a dark corridor . 
Riddle stopped walking . 
Harry also stood , watching Riddle . 
He could be sure that Riddle was thinking fiercely . 
He bit his lips , his forehead wrinkled countless folds . 
Then , as if the decision was made , Riddle rushed away . 
Harry also quietly clinging to the heels . 
They did not meet anyone until they reached the entrance to the Great Hall . There , on the marble staircase , there was a tall witch , a yellowish - brown beard , calling out to Riddle : 
- Tom , how late do you still wandering , what are you doing here ? 
Harry looked up at the witch . 
There was no one other than Dumbledore fifty years ago . 
Riddle said : 
- Teacher , I have a little need to meet the principal . 
- Go to bed . 
Dumbledore said , his gaze on Riddle was exactly the same look that Harry knew so well . 
Teacher said : 
- It is best not to go around the hallway these days . 
Should not , since 
He sighed heavily , wished Riddle good sleep , then strode away . 
Riddle looked at the teacher and went away , turning his head quickly , head down the stone stairs leading to the basement . 
Harry was still behind him . 
But Harry was a little disappointed , as Riddle did not lead him into a secret passage or hermitage , but to the basement he still studied medicine with Professor Snape . 
The torches were not lit , darkened , and when Riddle closed the door , leaving only a small gap , Harry could only see Riddle standing quietly at the door , gazing through the open gap . walk outside . 
Harry had the impression that Riddle was standing there for at least an hour . 
All that he observes is just the silhouette of Riddle at the door , gazing at the crevices , waiting like a stone statue . 
Just in time for what Harry had hoped for and began to return to the present , he heard something moving across the door . 
Someone is crawling along the corridor . 
Harry heard somebody crawling through the cellar that Riddle and it was hiding . 
Like a silent shadow , Riddle snapped through the door , and Harry followed suit . 
Forget about the voice or the sound it caused not to be heard by people in the past , Harry also crept behind Riddle . 
On both occasions footsteps in about five minutes , then Riddle suddenly stood back , his head tilted in the direction of a new noise . 
Harry heard the door open . 
Then someone's voice said in a whisper hoarse voice : 
- Let me take you out of this place 
Harry heard the familiar voice too 
Riddle suddenly jumped back and forth . 
Harry also stepped back behind it . 
A giant baby boy was bending down in front of a door , next to a giant box . 
Hello Rubeus Hagrid . 
Said the cold voice , 
- Hi Rubeus Hagrid . 
The giant boy slammed the door , straight up : 
- What are you doing here , Tom ? 
Riddle stepped closer , serious voice said : 
- to end it . 
I have to bring the game to the principal , Rubeus . People will shut down Hogwarts School if the attacks continue . 
- He said nothing 
- I do not think I have any intention of killing anyone . 
But monsters are not good animals . 
Make sure you just release it so that they can move a little , and they will 
Giant boy backed , leaning against the wall shouting : 
- It does not kill anyone ! 
Harry could hear the murmuring sounds , spurting behind the giant boy . 
The closer the bowler gets closer : 
- Come on , Rubeus . 
The cheeks of the killed girl will come here tomorrow . 
At least Hogwarts School must assure them that the killer of their daughter must be punished 
Giant baby roared : 
- Is not it ! 
Rubeus's voice echoed in the dark corridor . 
- It does not kill ! 
Does it kill anyone ? 
Riddle pulled out his wand and said , 
- Avoid the side ! 
Riddle's spell causes a spark to glow , shining on the corridor . 
The door to the back of the giant boy opened with a force that made it shot down the opposite wall . 
From the room crawling out a monster that Harry had to scream a terrible long rumble , but no one heard . 
A large monster , full of bristly hair on a tangle of black legs , a pair of sparkling eyes , and a pair of as sharp as a blade . 
Riddle raised his wand again , but it was too late . 
Riddle raised his wand again , but it was too late . 
The monster on the way to escape has hit the Riddle , rushed up the hallway and disappeared . 
Riddle struggled , staring at the monster , holding up his wand , but the giant boy jumped on Riddle , jerked his wand , and jumped down , screaming : 
- DRY ! 
The scene fades away , darkness spreads . 
Harry felt like he was falling , and then plopped down on his bed in Gryffindor's bedroom , with his arms folded like a spider's eagle , the Riddle's diary on his stomach , still open . . 
Harry had not finished his soul when the bedroom door opened , Ron walked in and said : 
- So you're here . 
Harry sat up . 
She was sweating and still trembling . 
Ron looked at Harry anxiously : 
- What happened ? 
Harry gasped : 
- Ron , it's Uncle Hagrid . 
The man who opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago was Hagrid . 
Chapter 14 : CORNELIUS FUDGE 
Since when did Harry , Ron , and Hermione all know that old Hagrid was one of the unfortunate people who liked the big , fierce animals . 
During their first year at Hogwarts they witnessed a young dragon in his tiny wooden hut . 
And yet the scary three - headed dog , named Fluffy , was long forgotten . 
Then if Hagrid , when he was a student at Hogwarts , heard of a monster who was hiding somewhere in the castle , how could he find a way to look at that monster , Harry firmly believed ? so . 
Maybe he thought it was too long to lock the monster for it , and maybe he just thought it was worth a moment to let go of his foot . 
Harry could have imagined Hagrid , a thirteen - year - old boy , jerking his muzzle against the monster's nose to take him out . 
But Harry absolutely believed that Hagrid had no intention of harming anyone . 
Harry slightly regretted that I found out how to write the Riddle diary . 
Hermione and Ron kept telling him what he had seen , until it bore up on the story and bore up on their conversation after hearing the story . 
Hermione said : 
- Maybe Riddle got the wrong person . 
Maybe another monster attacked Hagrid's monster . 
Asked Ron tiredly : 
- Do you think the castle can accommodate some monsters ? 
Harry was sad : 
" We all know Hagrid has been expelled for a long time . 
After the expulsion , certain assaults must be stopped ; If not , then Riddle won the medal . 
Ron gave another clue . 
- Riddle sounds like Percy too - Anyway , who is he pointing to Hagrid ? 
Hermione said : 
- The monster that killed Ron ? 
Harry added : 
" And if Hogwarts was closed , Riddle would have to go to the Muggle Orphanage , and at this point , I understand , I can not blame him for wanting to stay in school . 
" Oh , Harry , you've met Hagrid at Knockturn , have not you ? 
Harry replied : 
- Implanted to buy pesticides eat raw meat . 
All three suddenly silent . 
A moment later , Hermione uttered the most crucial question in a hesitant voice : 
" Do you think we should go straight to Hagrid about that ? " 
Ron sarcastically : 
- Surely the visit will be very happy : Hello Hagrid . 
Tell us , have you recently dropped something crazy and crazy in the castle ? 
Finally , they decided not to say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack . 
But as the days passed , Harry did not hear the whisper of the invisible voice , and they began to hope that they would not need Hagrid about his dismissal . 
Since Justin and Nick Nearhead have been petrified for four months now , almost everyone believes the culprit , no matter who goes , it must have washed their hands . The Peeves also bore the chorus of self - composed Oh , Harry Potter , rogues . 
One day in the Herbology class , Hufflepuff's Ernie was polite thanks to Harry giving him a bucket of poisonous mushrooms . 
And in March , the ginseng opened a loud noisy party in the third greenhouse . 
This made Professor Sprout very happy . 
The professor said to Harry : 
- to the time when they started to pitch their pots together is considered as adults . 
At that time , we will be able to revive some of the poor patients who are suffering from ventricular dysfunction . 
On Easter days , students in their second year are busy with headaches . 
It is time to choose the subject for the next school year . This was an issue that , at least Hermione thought was very important , Hermione said to Ron : 
- It can affect our future . 
The two are looking at the list of new subjects , marking the subject . 
Harry said : 
- I just want to leave the poison . 
Ron : 
- We can not leave . 
We have to keep all the old subjects , but if not , then we have dropped the art of anti - Dark . 
Hermione looks shocked at Ron's comments : 
- But that subject is very important ! 
Ron harshly : 
But the way Lockhart teaches the subject is important . 
I have not learned anything about him except that I should not let loose my little ones . 
Neville received countless letters from all of her near - distant sorcerers , enthusiastic and responsible for giving different advice about which subjects to choose . 
Neville was very confused and anxious , sat tongue - in - cheek reading the course catalog , wondering about people , but witch math was harder than magic notation . 
Dean Thomas , like Harry , had grown up in the Muggle family , finally decided by closing his eyes , holding his wand on the table , Studying the subject is complete . 
Hermione does not need to consult anyone , enrolled in all subjects . 
Harry only knew himself to smile miserably when thinking about what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to talk to them about his witch's future . 
But it does not really have any guidance . 
Leader Percy is very enthusiastic to share his experience with it . 
I said : 
- Depending on where you want to go , Harry . 
People should always think about their future ; So he introduced Tarot to me . 
People say Muggle - learning is a joke , but personally I think witch should have a thorough understanding of the non - magical community , especially when it comes to a career that will be commonplace . have access to them - for example , his father , who also deals with Muggle affairs . 
Charlie is a type of runner , so he pursues the Care of the Mysterious Creatures . 
Play with your strength , Harry . 
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch . 
In the end , Harry chose new things like Ron , because he felt that if it was too bad , at least somebody friendly would be willing to help . 
Gryffindor's next Quidditch match is against the Hufflepuffs . 
Wood kept practicing the team every night after dinner , and Harry had no time for anything other than practicing Quidditch and doing homework . 
However , the practice is gradually getting better , at least the sky is drying up gradually . 
On the evening before Saturday's match , Harry went to the bedroom in the Gryffindor Tower , dropping the broom with the conviction that the Gryffindor squad had a better chance of winning . 
But how long did it last ? 
At the top of the Gryffindor Tower , Harry meets Neville in a state of panic . 
- Harry , I do not know who did - I just found out 
Things in Harry's chest were thrown around the room . 
He was afraid to look at Harry , just pushing the bedroom door . 
Things in Harry's chest were thrown around the room . 
Its shirt lay on teng beng torn floor . 
The towel was pulled out of the bed and the drawer was pulled out of the shelf , and the contents inside were dropped onto the mattress . 
Harry stepped closer to the bed , gaping his mouth , treading on the pages of the Giant's Traveling Giant . 
When he and Neville pulled the blanket together , Ron , Dean and Seamus came in . 
Dean cursed garlic : 
- What is it , Harry ? 
Harry said : 
- I do not know . 
Ron examined Harry's robes , realizing that all the bags were upside down . 
Said Ron : 
- Someone is looking for something . 
Did you lose anything ? 
Harry began picking up his belongings , throwing them into the trunk . 
When he threw Lockhart's last book out of the box , it suddenly realized that something was missing . 
Harry said just enough for Ron to hear : 
- Riddle's diary is gone . 
- What ? 
Harry nodded toward the bedroom door , Ron followed it out . 
Both students rushed to the common room at the time was quite absent , only a half of students still sit or talk . 
They went to sit next to Hermione . 
She was sitting alone reading Magical Notation . 
Hearing the stolen diary , Hermione was terrified : 
- But only the Gryffindor can do the steal that nobody knows our password 
Harry said : 
- exactly . 
The next day people wake up in the sun , warm sun , cool wind . 
- perfect condition for a Quidditch match ! 
Wood eagerly spoke at the Gryffindor table , the squad of players in the squad of scrambled eggs . 
He called Harry : 
- So many , Harry . 
I need a breakfast game ! 
Harry looked across Gryffindor's long table , wondering if the new owner of the Riddle diary was right in front of him . 
Hermione had promised Harry to go away , but Harry did not like that idea . 
If he's going to lose , then Harry will have to tell the teacher all the stories related to the diary . 
Which of them do not know how many people know that Hagrid was expelled fifty years ago ? 
Harry does not want to be the one who revives all that . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione left the Hall to get equipment for the Quidditch match , another serious worry was added to Harry's growing list of concerns : On the marble stairs , it suddenly heard the voice again : 
- Phen we kill the shredder to tear 
Harry screamed , and both Ron and Hermione jumped back and forth . 
Harry looked back : 
- Voice ! 
I just heard the voice - can you hear me ? 
Ron shook his head , his eyes wide . 
But Hermione clapped her hand on her forehead as she thought about it : 
- Harry , I think I understand ! 
I have to go to the library ! 
She finished running up the stairs . 
- What does Hermione understand ? 
Harry panicked while still looking around , trying to find out where that voice came from . 
Ron shook his head : 
- Hermione knows a lot more than we do . 
Harry wondered : 
- But why did Hermione run to the library ? 
Ron shrugged . 
- That was Hermione's style . 
When there is any uncertainty go to the library ! 
Harry stood there , confused , eager to hear his voice again , but then everyone was out of the hall , bustling around behind him . 
Everyone was chatting loudly , eagerly going through the front door to pull out to Quidditch Stadium . 
Said Ron : 
- You should go better . 
Almost 11 o ' clock , the match 
Harry ran up to the Gryffindor Tower , his Nimbus 2000 , and crowded across the school grounds . 
But the mind still lurks in the castle , steeped in the invisible voice . 
And when he wore a purple robe in the dressing room , he thought there was only one thing left to do now , that everyone was in the Quidditch yard . 
The two teams came out in the midst of the cheers of heaven and earth . 
Wood jumped on the flying broom to fly to the golf pole to start . 
Ms . Hooch released the balls . The Hufflepuff wore yellow robes and was hugging tactics until the last minute . 
Harry just climbed over the broomstick and Professor McGonagall walked as if running across the yard , carrying a huge purple speaker . 
Harry's heart fell like a falling stone . 
Professor McGonagall announced through the loudspeaker to the crowded crowd : 
- Abolish this Quidditch match ! 
From the audience shouted protest . 
Face Wood as if someone just sticks the wheel . 
He landed on the ground and headed for Professor McGonagall without climbing out of the broom . 
He yelled : 
- But Professor - we are going to compete for the Gryffindor Cup 
Professor McGonagall does not care about him , continues to play : 
- All students must return to their common room . 
In that case , the homeroom teachers will give you more information . 
Try to hurry up . 
After announcing , the professor lowered , signaling for Harry to approach : 
- Harry , she thought you should go with her . 
Harry is confused or is this professor suspected it . 
He saw Ron trying to break away from the crowd complaining to run to it , bringing together back to the castle . 
Harry was surprised , as Professor McGonagall not only protested but also said : 
" Oh , maybe you should go with her too , Ron . 
Around the same time , some students still lingered , regretting the quidditch game was canceled , some expressed anxiety . 
Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back to school , climbing up the marble stairs . 
But this time they were not taken to anyone's office . 
Professor McGonagall leads them toward ventricular hypertrophy . 
She told them in a surprisingly gentle voice : 
- This is a little bit moving . 
There is an additional attack a double attack 
Harry's inside liver fluttered . 
Professor McGonagall pushed the door shut and Ron and Harry entered . 
Mrs. Pomfrey was bending over her bed to take care of a fifth - grader girl with long curly hair . 
Harry realized that this was the girl in the Ravenclaw family that they had come across and made their way to the Slytherin common room . 
And , on the bed next to this girl is 
- Hermione ! 
Shouted Ron . 
Hermione remained completely motionless , eyes wide and transparent . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- They are found near the library . 
Do not know if any of these two children can explain this ? 
This item is located on the floor next to these games 
She raised a small round mirror . 
Ron and Harry both shook their heads , both staring at Hermione . 
Professor McGonagall spoke again in a heavy voice : 
- She will take two children to Gryffindor Tower . You have to talk to the students anyway . 
The Gryffindor resident boarder filled the common room , listening quietly to Professor McGonagall , 
- All students must return to the common room at 6 pm . 
After the curfew , no student was allowed to leave the bedroom . 
Each class will be accompanied by a teacher . 
No student can go to the toilet without a teacher . 
All Quidditch training and competitions have been postponed . 
Evening leisure activities are also suspended . 
Professor McGonagall rolled the parchment on the notice she had just read . 
She added with a choked voice : 
- You do not need to add that you never hurt again like this time . 
It is possible that the school will be closed if any mastermind behind the rolls has not yet been arrested . 
She strongly advised the children , anyone , if you think you know anything about these things , boldly say . 
Immediately after Professor McGonagall struggled through the portraits of Mrs. Beo and went away , the whole Gryffindor family burst into tears . 
Weasley's twin brother , Lee Jordan , is spreading his arms : 
So there were two Gryffindors in the house , not to mention a Gryffindor , a Ravenclaw , and a Hufflepuff . 
Do not know any teachers note that the Slytherin is still peace ? 
Is it not clear that all of this has come from the Slytherins ? 
Which is the Slytherin Successor , Slytherin's Monster . 
Why do not we check each of the Slytherins individually ? 
Here in the room the approval of Lee . 
On Lee's back , Percy sat quietly in a chair for the first time , showing no interest in expressing or commenting . 
He looked pale and was severely stunned . 
George whispered to Harry : 
- You were very touched . 
The daughter of Ravenclaw was attacked , Penelope , she was also a leader . 
Surely Percy was shocked because the monster attacked everyone , not the leader . 
Harry just heard George say an ear . His mind still can not get out of the picture Hermione lying on the bed in sickness as if a statue carved out of rock . 
And if the mastermind is not caught soon , then its future will be equally catastrophic . 
He dreaded life with Professor Dursley . 
Riddle was handed over to Hagrid because Riddle faced the prospect of returning to life in a Muggle orphanage if Hogwarts was closed . 
Harry was deeply touched by this Riddle mood fifty years ago . 
In Harry's ear , Ron's voice echoed softly : 
- What should we do ? 
Do you think people are suspicious of Hagrid ? 
Harry decides : 
- We have to see you talk . 
I can not believe this time is also the cause . 
But if you have released the monster the other time , you will know how to enter the Confidential Chamber . That may be the clue to starting things up . 
- But Professor McGonagall told us to stay in the dormitory without a lesson , 
Said Harry , with a deep voice . 
- I think it is time to spend on the Cloak of his father . 
The Cloak The long and silky Cloak is the only thing Harry inherited from his father . 
Dressing it was the only chance he could sneak out of the school to visit Hagrid without being noticed . 
In the evening , the two of them went to bed as usual , waiting for Neville , Dean and Seamus to stop discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fell asleep . 
Then they woke up , dressed , wearing Cloak on Cloak . 
Going through the dark corridors in the castle is not interesting at all . 
Previously , Harry had been wandering in the castle at night many times , but never before had he seen the night of the castle as crowded as now : the teachers , the chief priests , and the ghosts . Spread through the corridors , observe the surrounding area , watch each activity is unusual . 
In the Invisibility Cloak , the two of them were not seen , but the noise they caused was not audible . 
They were so tense as to walk past Snape who was standing guard , Ron stumbling to his feet , just a few steps from him . 
Blessed are they just when Ron uttered a whimper , then at the moment Snape sneeze one . 
Just after passing through the massive oak door and spitting out , Harry and Ron were just a little relieved . 
The night sky was very clear and full of stars . 
The two hastened to follow the light coming from the window of Hagrid's house and went off , only taking off the Cloak sheet when he arrived at the door of the house . 
Hagrid stood in front of them , bow in his hand straight up 
The door opened as soon as the two children just knocked . 
Hagrid stood in front of them , the arch in his hand straightened , the arrow on the string stretched and pointed to the right two children . Behind Fang support with loud barking . 
But he dropped the bow down immediately after the uttering of astonishment : 
- Reason ? 
What do you do here ? 
They stare at them . 
Two children entered the house . 
Harry asked the bow : 
- What for ? Hagrid ? 
Hagrid whispered : 
- There is nothing wrong with me , it's okay to sit down and the kids will make tea 
But Hagrid looked awkward as if he did not know what he was doing . 
He nearly doused the flames when he placed the supper on the stove , causing the waves to pour out . 
Then he broke the tea pot when he waved his big hand in a state of nervousness . 
Harry asked : 
- Uncle Hagrid ? 
Have you heard of Hermione ? 
Said Hagrid , his voice unnatural : 
- Oh , have you heard ? 
He looked anxiously out the window . 
Boiling water , he poured water into two large cups ( he forgot to put tea into the warm ) . 
Then he took a piece of fruit cake , just put it on the plate and hear the knock on the door . 
Hagrid jerked off a piece of fruit pie . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other in horror . 
They immediately rolled up the Cloak Cloak to cover himself , and back to the corner of the hut . 
After they were sure they were hiding , Hagrid grabbed the bow and opened the door again . 
It turned out to be Dumbledore . 
He walked into the hut , looking extremely serious . 
The next step was followed by a freak . 
The stranger had a mess of gray hair and a nervous expression , dressed in a weird outfit : a small striped suit , a red tie , a black coat , and a pair of boots . sharp purple . 
Under his armpit he also clamped a lemon yellow felt hat again . 
Ron whispered softly : 
- that is my father's father , Corneluis Fudge , Minister of Magic . 
Harry shook Ron's elbow to catch it . 
Hagrid was sweating and his face looked pale . 
He plopped down one of the chairs in the hut , looking at Dumbledore to the Minister of Magic . 
Mr. Fudge's voice cracked as if he could not open his mouth . 
- No , Hagrid . 
You do too badly . 
I have to do it . 
Four students attacked the Muggle children and it was too far away . 
The Ministry of Magic must act . 
Hagrid looked up at Dumbledore pleadingly : 
- I did not do it . 
You know I did not do it , Professor . 
Dumbledore told Fudge solemnly : 
- Mr. Fudge , I want to make sure you know I completely trust Mr. Hagrid . 
But Mr. Fudge is not very comfortable : 
" Mr. Dumbledore , you think , Hagrid's record does not benefit him at all . 
The Ministry of Magic must do something - the school administration has contacted 
Dumbledore said : 
- Still , Mr. Fudge , I still told you to take Hagrid away and not solve anything at all . 
Dumbledore's deep blue eyes burned the fire that Harry had never seen before . 
Mr. Fudge wiggled with the felt hat in his hand : 
Look at this from my point of view : I am under a lot of pressure . 
I have to show people that I do something . 
If the culprit was not Hagrid then he would be released and no one would talk about it . 
But now I have to arrest him . That's it . 
Can not fail to fulfill his duties . 
Hagrid trembled : 
- Getting me ? 
Where do I go ? 
Mr. Fudge avoided seeing Hagrid's eyes : 
- Only detention for investigation . 
No punishment , Hagrid . 
It's just a defense . 
If someone is arrested , he will be released with an official apology . 
Hagrid groaned . 
- do not confine me to Azkaban . 
The man who entered Hagrid's hut was none other than Lucius Malfoy 
Mr. Fudge did not respond in time to knock another knock on the door . 
Dumbledore opened the door . 
At that moment , Harry was hit by Ron with a fierce thud , so much so that it almost burst into a moan . 
The man who entered Hagrid's hut was none other than Lucius Malfoy , in his black and long black coat , and on his face contemptuously a cold smile . 
Fang growled . 
Mr. Lucius nodded : 
- Are you present , Mr. Fudge ? 
Good , good 
Hagrid was angry : 
- What are you doing here ? 
Get out of my house ! 
Lucius Malfoy smirked as he looked around the hut : 
- Dear friend , please believe me , I have no interest in visiting what you call home ? 
I passed by the school and learned that the principal was here . 
Dumbledore asked : 
- What exactly do you need from me , Mr. Malfoy ? 
Dumbledore's voice sounded polite , but the fire in his eyes was still burning . 
Mr Malfoy made a languid pull of a long roll of parchment : 
- It's bad , Mr. Dumbledore . 
But the school management felt it was time to avoid it . This is a Work Suspension Order . 
You can find there are 12 signatures in this . 
I'm afraid he is losing his mind . 
How many attacks have been made in school so far ? 
This afternoon there were two more attacks , right ? 
Soon there will be no more Muggle students at Hogwarts , and you know how big a loss this is for our school ? 
Mr. Fudge looked frightened : 
- Oh , Mr. Malfoy , look here , this is how Dumbledore was suspended from work , no , I do not really want that now . 
Mr. Malfoy said gently : 
- The appointment - or suspension - of the principal is a matter of the school board , Mr. Fudge . 
And Dumbledore could not do anything to stop the student attacks on campus 
Mr. Fudge , sweat drooling around his mouth , still trying to present : 
Malfoy , like this , if Dumbledore can not stop the attacks , who can do it now ? 
- That is still considered . 
Mr. Malfoy smiled a distasteful smile , ending : 
- All twelve of us voted . 
Hagrid stood up , his big , shaggy head nearing the ceiling : 
" So before they even agreed , how many of them had they threatened to buy , Mr. Malfoy ? 
Mr. Malfoy still wryly said : 
" Well , watch out , your anger just gives you more trouble in this day and age . " 
I advise you not to scream in the face of those Azkaban guards . 
They do not like it at all . 
Hagrid screamed , making Fang cringe . 
- You can not kick Dumbledore ! 
If you leave the school , the Muggle children will not survive . 
They will be killed instantly ! 
Dumbledore said , 
- Calm down , Uncle Hagrid . 
You look at Mr. Malfoy : 
- If the management wanted to get me out , then of course I would step aside 
Mr. Fudge stammered : 
- Nh 
Hagrid shouted : 
- ARE NOT ! 
Dumbledore broke his dark blue eyes from Malfoy's cold gray eyes : 
- However 
Dumbledore continued , clearly worded so that no one could miss a word : 
- You will find that I only really leave school when no one here is loyal to me . 
You will also find that those who seek help will always find that help right at this Hogwarts school . 
At that moment , Harry was almost convinced that Dumbledore's dazzling glint swept through the corner of the room where he and Ron were hiding . 
Mr. Malfoy tilted his head and said , 
- It's so admirable . 
All of us will remember the way your very own manager , Dumbledore , just wanted his successors to try to stop the killings . 
Mr. Malfoy walked to the door , opened the door and tilted Dumbledore out . 
Mr. Fudge , struggling with his hat , waited for Hagrid to go ahead . 
But Hagrid stood still , took a deep breath , and said with extreme caution : 
- If anyone wants to find out what's involved in this , he just follows the spiders . 
They will lead the way ! that's all we need to say . 
Mr. Fudge looked at Hagrid , surprised . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Finished , I'm leaving . 
He picked up his mole coat . 
But when he was about to follow Fudge out the door , he stopped again and said loudly : 
- While I was not at home , someone needed to feed Fang . 
The door opened and closed again . 
Ron and Harry pulled on the Cloak sheet . 
Said Ron in a husky voice : 
- Now we are in trouble . 
No Dumbledore to protect his teaching anymore . 
They will probably close the school tonight . 
Without Dumbledore , dare to attack every day . 
Fang began to stomp on the carpet and locks on the closed door . 
Chapter 15 : ARAGOG 
Summer is crawling through the courtyard of the castle ; The sky and the lake have changed to the blue of the pink hybrids . 
In the glass house , the flowers begin to bloom , which is the size of the cabbage . 
But out of the castle window , once Hagrid was absent from the school yard , with Fang's dog clinging to his heels , Harry would not be as happy anymore . 
In fact , the situation inside the castle is not quite anything , everything is suddenly become very confused . 
Harry and Ron tried to visit Hermione several times , but now the guests were banned from the past to close sickness . 
Through the opening of the patient isolation ward , Mrs. Pomfrey sternly told them : 
- You must avoid creating opportunities for dangerous things to happen . 
I'm sorry , but that's not possible . 
Whenever an attacker can return to end the lives of those who lie 
Never had that terrible fear spread like these days , when Dumbledore was no longer in school . 
The sun seemed to just warm outside the castle walls , then stopped outside the window bars . 
Inside the school , everyone's face is exposed to stress and anxiety . 
In the corridor there was laughter , the laughter was abnormal , agitated , and often quickened . 
Harry always remembered Dumbledore's last words : 
- You will find that I only really leave school when no one here loyal to me . 
You will also find that those who seek help will always find that help right at this Hogwarts school . 
But what is the use of these words in the present situation ? 
Who do you expect to help now when everyone is confused and scared like they do ? 
However , Hagrid's hints refer to Hagrid's spiders , which are much easier to understand - but it is unlikely that there are no spiders left in the castle for them to follow . 
Harry had to look around , wherever he went , with Ron's help . 
Of course , they are not allowed to wander alone , but must always be with the other students in the Gryffindor family whenever they have to move in the castle . 
Most of the others seemed happy when they were going from one classroom to another , but it was annoying for Harry . 
However , there still seems to be a person who seems to enjoy the smell of air now . it's Draco Malfoy . 
He walked around the school with an overbearing look as if he had just been given the title of Male Secretary . 
Two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid were removed from school , Harry realized what Malfoy was up to . 
That day in the poison class , Harry sat behind Malfoy , heard it haggle to Crabbe and Goyle : 
" I think it would be my daddy to get rid of Dumbledore . 
Malfoy did not even need to lower his voice , for a third : 
- I told you , my dad saw Dumbledore as the worst headmaster ever in this Hogwarts . 
Now maybe we are going to have a proper principal who intends to close the Secret Chamber door . 
McGonagall was just temporarily filling the principal chair , but could not sit still 
At that moment , Snape walked past Harry , not commenting on Hermione's empty seat and empty cauldron . 
Shouted Malfoy : 
- Master teacher , why do not you ask the principal's head teacher ? 
- Okay , Malfoy . 
Snape's teacher rebuked Malfoy , though he could not hide the smile on his thin lips : 
- Professor Dumbledore was stopped by the board only . 
I dare say that the professor will come back to us soon enough . 
Malfoy laughed wryly . 
- Where are you ? 
I guarantee you will vote for me if you apply for a job . 
I will tell you that I am the most ideal professor here . 
Snape smirked as he walked around the study hall , and fortunately he did not see Seamus impaling himself on the cauldron of his cauldron . 
Malfoy continued with three speakers : 
- I wonder why the Blood Mud still not pack away from the school quickly . 
Tao fishing gold coin Galleon who is the next death yawn . 
If it was not for Hermione , it was a pity 
At that time the bell rang , as well as luck , because Malfoy had uttered the last few hours as Ron jumped out of his seat . 
As everyone was busy preparing books for the pair , Ron did not see much of Malfoy jumping . 
Harry and Dean grabbed Ron's arms tightly , holding Ron , but Ron snarled : 
- Let go , let me beat him for a match . 
I'm afraid , I do not need my lever wand , I ' ll beat the guy with the fist 
Overhead , Snape was shouting , 
- Hurry up ! 
I also have to take all the way through herbal medicine classes ! 
The two lined up to each other , Harry , Ron and Dean hugging each other , Ron still struggled in the grip of the two children . 
They were just relieved to let go of Ron after Snape had taken them out of the castle , and let them pass through several vegetable gardens to the glass enclosure . 
Air Classical Herbology is now somewhat sad ; The class had two students , Hermione and Justin . 
Professor Sprout assigns the students to practice pruning . 
Harry went to the pile of fertilizer to drop a fistful of stalks of flowers . 
It suddenly dawned on Hufflepuff's Ernie standing face to face with him , solemn : 
- Harry , I want to meet you just to say sorry I suspected you . 
I know you will not attack Hermione . 
I apologize for all the wrong things that I have said about you . 
Now all of us are the same boat council . 
Then 
Ernie straightened his mop of her hand , and Harry held out his hand . 
Ernie and her friend , Hannah , then prune Sung trees together with Ron and Harry . 
Ernie scooped up a dry branch and said , 
" Malfoy's character , is it so funny about other people's misfortunes ? 
You know , I suspect it is Slytherin's Successor . 
- So you are also wise ! 
Said Ron , seemingly angry , not willing to forgive Ernie like Harry . 
Ernie asked : 
- Do you think it's Malfoy , Harry ? 
- Are not . 
Harry's voice was so strong that both Ernie and Hannah gazed at it . 
On the ground , countless giant spiders are running on ice . 
At that moment , Harry suddenly noticed something strange . 
On the ground , countless giant spiders are running on ice . 
Harry grabbed a tree to knock Ron's arm , causing Ron to exclaim : 
- Skin buried ! 
What is wrong with you ? 
Harry just spiders . 
Ron also looked around , trying to be cheerful , though not very good , and said : 
- Oh , see . 
But now how can we follow them ? 
Ernie and Hannah listened with great curiosity . 
Harry watched the spider fly away , he said : 
- It seems they are heading towards the Forbidden Forest 
Ron was not excited at all to hear that . 
At the end of the Herbal Medicine session , Professor Sprout escorted the small pupils to the Black Hawk Art class . 
Ron and Harry were strangled behind the scenes so they could talk to each other without being heard by others . 
Harry said to Ron : 
- We ' ll have to use the Cloak sheet again . 
You can also take Fang along . 
He used to go to the forest with Uncle Hagrid , he knew it was work . 
- it's correct ! 
Ron turned his wand in a restless manner . 
It says : 
- Do not know that in the Forbidden Forest there are werewolves ? 
Without Lockhart's class , just sliding down to the last table in the classroom to sit as usual , Harry dodged no answer to Ron's question by saying , 
- In the Forbidden Forest there are also many good things . 
Cattle people do not harm anyone , but some white code 
The Forbidden Forest never came to an end , and Harry was once and never wanted to come again . 
At that moment Lockhart jumped into the room , making the whole class look round . 
This time , while all the other professors at the school seemed a little sloppy , Lockhart looked still as usual . 
He stood in front of the class smiling bright with everyone , exclaimed : 
- Cheer up ! 
Why are everyone squatting like this ? 
The students exchanged glances , but no one answered Lockhart . 
- Did not people notice anything ? 
Mr. Lockhart said slowly as if the students were idiots . 
- Disaster is over ! 
The culprit was arrested 
Dean shook his mouth . 
- Who said that ? 
In the voice of a person explaining a plus one is two , Mr. Lockhart said : 
" Dear young man , the Minister of Magic will never arrest Hagrid if he is not 100 percent sure he is guilty . 
Ron said , louder than Dean : 
- Oh yes , life ! 
Mr. Lockhart continued , his voice smugly : 
" Hey , Ron , I dare say that I know the details of arresting Hagrid more than you know , Ron . 
Ron opened his mouth to argue , but he had to shut his mouth in the middle of the sentence because Harry kicked a target under the table . 
Harry reminds : 
- At that time we were invisible , as if we were not there . 
Do not remember ? 
Mr. Lockhart's hated excitement , as if to say that he had known Hagrid for a long time , could not be used , and with his innocent confidence that the whole mess had come to an end . , making Harry so angry that he just wanted to throw away Wandering with the Vampires . 
But it was self - restrained , writing to Ron words : 
Tonight's action . 
Ron read the piece of paper , swallowed hard , and stared at the vacant chair where Hermione sat . 
The vacancy seemed to help reinforce its decision , Ron nodded . 
Gryffindor's common room these days is always crowded , because from six o ' clock in the afternoon the kids have no other place to hang out . 
Again , they also have a lot to talk about . 
As a result , the common room was never quiet before midnight . 
Shortly after dinner , Harry pulled Cloak out of the chest , resting on the shirt from evening until midnight , waiting for the living room to be empty . 
Fred and George asked Ron and Harry to play cards . 
Ginny sat , right in the seat of Hermione often sitting , watching his brothers are playing . 
Ron and Harry deliberately lose to finish the game early . 
But even after midnight , Fred , George and Ginny left the living room to sleep . 
Harry and Ron carefully waited for all the echoes from the male bedroom and the dorm room to get off , then grabbed the jacket , spread it over him , and climbed over the hole in his leg . Mrs. Ba Be out . 
Going through the castle , while walking and avoiding the collision of the guard patrol at this time more frightened than the previous sleep . 
Finally , the two of them made their way to the lobby , pushed the door handle of the huge oak door , gently squeezed through , trying not to make a trumpet , then exited the moonlit courtyard . 
Two strangers stomped on the black grass , crossing the large garden . 
Ron suddenly said : 
- Maybe I go to the forest to see that there is nothing to follow . 
After all , the spiders are sure to pull together in the forest . 
I know that the spiders look like they run towards the forest , but 
Ron stretched his voice , hoping that they would not have to go to the Forbidden Forest . 
They reached the door of Hagrid's house , the darkened window of the old house that added to the sadness . 
Harry pushed the door , Fang jumped up , happy to see his friends again . 
They feared loud barking like dog firecrackers can wake up the castle . 
They took Fang's honey candy in a tin casserole on top of the fireplace . 
Thanks to these candies , Fang's teeth were sticking together and it stopped barking . 
Harry left the invisibility cloak on Hagrid's desk . 
The black forest as a buttonhole should also not need a cloak . 
Harry patted the dog thigh , saying : 
- Let's go , Fang , let's go take a walk . 
Fang excitedly followed the two children out of the house and ran to the edge of the forest . 
Walking through a maple tree , Fang happily held up one leg to water the tree . 
Harry pulled out his wand muttering : 
- Lumos ! [ Meaning : Brightness ] 
Immediately a tiny lamp appeared at the end of the chopsticks , just enough for the two to detect traces of the spiders in the path . 
Said Ron : 
- Good idea . 
I could also light my wand , but , you know , it explodes or something else . 
Harry patted Ron's shoulders , pointing to the grass : two odd spiders were hurrying to escape the light of their wand light , which they had hidden behind a tree . 
Ron sighed , as if to succumb to the worst : 
- Okay . 
I'm ready . 
Let's go ! 
So they all went into the forest , Fang ran around , sniffing the stumps and leaves . 
Thanks to the light of the wand light , they followed the sign of the spiders moving along the path . 
The two spider - goers had twenty minutes to say nothing , listening only to the static , but they could hear no more than the sound of dried branches and the rustling of leaves . 
As the forest deepens , the trees become more dense . 
As deep in the forest , the trees become more dense , so that no longer see the stars in the sky above . 
The only light left between the immense black sea was the lamp at Harry's wand . 
With that light , they saw the guiding spiders began to take the path . 
Harry paused , trying to figure out where the spiders were coming from , but around , in addition to the tiny light of the wand's headlight , was a completely blackened area . 
Last time Harry did not go into the jungle as this time . 
He remembered very clearly that time , also in this forest , Hagrid advised him never to leave the path . 
But now Hagrid is miles away , perhaps locked up in the Azkaban witch's prison . 
And his last words told Harry to just follow the spiders . 
There was something moist that touched Harry's hand that made him jerk back and forth , stomping on Ron's leg . 
But it turned out to be just Fang's snout . 
Harry said to Ron : 
- You see ? 
He could only see Ron's eyes reflecting the light of the wand's light , but it was hard to see his face . 
Said Ron , 
- Well , we've been here all along . 
Always come . 
They continue to follow the spider's shadow flicker , go deeper in the forest . 
At this time , it is impossible to go fast , because in the darkness , the roots and roots of the trees on the ground make their paths become very rough . 
Harry felt Fang's hot breath on his hand . 
And to walk a little bit must stop to light up to see where the spiders went . 
It seems like they have been away for at least half an hour . 
The bundle of bushes and low branches are beams . 
A few moments later they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping down , although the trees remained firmly unchanged . 
Suddenly Fang emits a loud bark , resonating , making both Ron and Harry exhausted , missing the skin . 
Ron is : 
- What is this ? 
He tried to look through the thick darkness around him , his hands clutching Harry's elbows . 
Harry sighed : 
- There's something moving around here Listening to It looks like something is very big 
Both listen . somewhere on the right , there is something very big broken branches to open the way through the forest . 
Ron babble : 
- Oh , come on , let's stop it 
Harry went mad : 
- Shut up ! 
He heard you now . 
- Hear my voice ? 
Ron's voice was unusually high . - He heard Fang's voice before ! 
The darkness seemed to overwhelm the two children's eyebrows as they both stood out , eyes wide open , waiting , panic . 
There was a strange growl , and then silent . 
Harry asked : 
- What do you think it's going to do ? 
Said Ron : 
- He is about to jump on me . 
They are afraid , trembling , just waiting , not dared to move anything . 
Then Harry whispered again : 
- Do you think it's gone ? 
- Who knows ! 
At that moment , suddenly on the right they lighted the spotlight , especially in the dark dark night the light was so dazzling that even Harry and Ron unknowingly raised his hand to the forehead to cover his eyes . 
Fang screamed and ran away , but was trapped in the thorns so that the more he felt . 
- Harry ! 
Ron shouted , his voice cracking in exasperation : 
- Harry , my car here ! 
- What ? 
- Come on ! 
Harry followed Ron to the light , slipped , stumbled , almost fell , but soon found himself in the woods . 
Mr. Weasley's car was lying there 
Mr. Weasley's car was lying there , under a dense foliage , headlights illuminated . 
Ron gasped at the car , the car slowly moving toward Ron , just like a giant dog was celebrating . 
Ron was happy , walking around the car , hissing : 
- It has been here since then until now ! 
Look ! 
Forest has turned it into a wilderness 
The sides of the car were scratched and muddy . 
Apparently , he had brushed himself around the forest by himself . 
Fang does not seem to like the car very much . 
He tried to follow Harry's feet , and Harry felt the dog was shivering . 
Slowly breathing , Harry put his wand in his pocket . 
Ron leaned on the car , his hands pounding on the trunk like a flap : 
- So we thought it was going to attack us ! 
I wondered how long the car gone ! 
Harry squinted in the light that the car's headlights shone , and see if there were any spiders . 
But the spiders ran wildly out of the light of the headlights . 
Harry said : 
- We lost track . 
Well , go find the spiders . 
But Ron did not reply . 
He did not even budge , his eyes fixed on a spot just behind Harry , a little hovering overhead . 
Its face was shattered by horror . 
Harry did not even have time to turn around to see what it was . 
A loud voice resounded and it suddenly felt something long and fluffy spread across the body , lifting it off the ground , causing it to be suspended in the air , face down to the ground . 
Harry was scared , struggling , but he heard another sound , and saw that Ron's legs were also crushed off the ground . 
Fang shrieked and cleared his throat . 
In the blink of an eye , Harry was swept away in the jungle . 
With his head down , Harry found himself trapped by a monster with six long legs full of feathers . 
Monster's front legs clutched Harry in a pair of black balls . Behind it , Harry could hear the footsteps of another monster , mustering Ron . 
The monsters were coming in deep in the forest , Harry heard the sound of Fang trying to escape from the third monster . 
Fang fumbled with excitement , but Harry , though he wanted to scream , could not even utter a word . 
It seems that its voice has been left behind with the car in the open field in the forest . 
Harry could not tell how long it was . 
It just suddenly became a little dark so that it could see the ground covered with leaves . Now it was time to spider the spiders . 
Raising his neck to look up , Harry noticed that he had come to the edge of a large hole . 
The hole was not covered by trees , so the starlight in the sky dims to the bottom of the lake , which Harry found out the worst scene it ever seen in life . 
Spiders love 
Not the little spiders crawl through dry leaves on the ground , but as spider - like carriages , with eight eyes , eight legs , hairy , and black . 
The spider's giant , Harry , paved the way to the hole through an old steep slope , to a fuzzy spider web in the center of the hole . 
The giant spider moths around the spider's web , jumping up and down splutteringly before the scene of the comrades bringing back the prey that looks delicious . 
When the giant spider drops the bait , Harry falls to the ground and jumps up . 
Ron and Fang also fell down beside him . 
Fang is no longer bothered , just lying there , silent . 
Ron looked as horrified as Harry . 
Its mouth was wide as it was screaming , an unbelievable scream , but two eyes went out to almost faint . 
Harry suddenly realized that the spider munched it and said it was saying something . 
It is difficult to hear what it says , because every tongue is accompanied by the clang clang . 
The spider said : 
- Aragog ! 
Aragog ! 
From the center of the dense web of spider webs , a spider with the size of a small elephant appears . 
From the middle of the dense spider web , a spider and spider's legs are gray , while the eyes on the head are white . 
This spider is blind . 
Just as impatiently , the blind spider called Aragog asked : 
- Something ? 
The spider grabbed Harry's reply : 
- People . 
Aragog moved closer , his eight opaque eyes swirling around ambiguously . 
- Is it Hagrid ? 
The spider catches Ron : 
- Stranger . 
Aragog , 
- Kill them . 
I'm sleeping 
Harry is : 
- We are Hagrid's friend . 
His heart seemed to have jumped from his chest and soared to his throat . 
The way the spleen , the clang of the giant spiders sound around all around . 
Aragog stopped . 
Then he slowly said : 
- Uncle Hagrid has never sent anyone to see me . 
Harry gasped , explaining , 
- Hagrid is in trouble . 
So we have to come here . 
The old spider mimicked : 
- Are you in trouble ? 
Harry felt the attention and the clanging cries . 
- But why did he send us here ? 
Harry thought about trying to stand up , but then decided to leave that thought , because he did not believe that his legs would support his body . 
So , Harry was lying on the ground saying , trying hard to calm down : 
At school , it was thought that Hagrid had released something to kill the student . 
They have arrested the imprisoned Azkaban . 
Aragog's anger was so mad , and the crowd of spiders present throughout the pit was as much a response as the crowd did . 
The clattering sound seemed like a clap clap , but it was a clap of applause that made Harry lose his guts . 
Aragog said irritably . 
- But that was old . 
Old rusty shake . 
I remember clearly . 
Because of that , they expelled him . 
They thought that was the monster sheltered in the Chamber of Secrets . 
They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets and released me . 
Sweat cooled on Harry's forehead , he nervously stammered asked : 
- So you're not the monster that came out of the Secret Chamber ? 
- I ? 
Aragog shouted , clapping his anger . 
- I was not born in that castle , my country is far away . 
A pilgrim brought me to Hagrid when I was still an egg . 
Hagrid was still a student at the time . 
But he took care of me , hidden me in the cupboard in the castle , fed me with leftovers that he collected at the table . 
Hagrid was a good man , a great friend of mine . 
When they discovered me , blaming me for the girl's death , Hagrid defended me . 
Since then I have lived in this forest , Uncle Hagrid often come here to visit me . 
He even worries about getting married 
Give her husband to me , he brought Mosag here as my wife , and we see that , my family now has her grandfather pile up there . 
All thanks to Hagrid's kindness 
Harry gathered all the courage left in him , asking : 
- So you did not attack anyone ? 
The old spider crouched with his mouth : 
- No way . 
Our instincts are not gentle , but because of Hagrid's respect , there is no way we can harm a human . 
The dead girl's body is in the women's bath . 
But I did not know anything else in the castle , except the cupboard where Hagrid had raised me . 
Our favorite breed enjoys quietness in the dark 
- So do you know what killed the girl ? 
Harry desperately asked , and said : 
- Because , no matter what , now it is attacking students in school 
Harry's words were engulfed in the mass of the cries of the more and more thugs in anger . 
The swirling , spider - like mantle was moving around Harry . 
Aragog says : 
- He lives in the castle . 
An ancient creature whose spiderweb is more afraid than anything else in the world . 
When we feel the existence of the beast that is hanging around the castle , I begged Hagrid to release me . 
I still remember clearly . 
Harry begged urgently : 
- What is it ? 
Surrounding up the clanging clattering , the dark shadows of the giant spiders as they approached Harry . 
Aragog said angrily . 
- I do not want to talk about it ! 
I never called it ! 
As for Hagrid , I never mentioned the name of that horrible beast , even though he had asked me many times . 
Harry does not want to force an old spider . 
Especially as the spiders around them are pushing against it from all directions . 
Aragog seems tired of talking . 
He slowly backed up to his seat in the middle of the vaulted spider web . 
But the spiders ' descendants continued to ramp up to Harry and Ron . 
Harry heard the rustling of the leaves around him . 
It urgent call Aragog : 
- Then we go away . 
Aragog's voice was astonished : 
- go home ? 
I do not think so 
- But 
- My daughter's daughter , according to my order , is not harming Hagrid . 
But we can not stop them from taking fresh meat to our own territory . 
Well , goodbye , friends of Hagrid . 
Harry turned around . 
Just a few feet away , fainting above it was a band of spider mites forming a solid wall that surrounded them . 
The hungry spider hung up and spit out the glittering eyes on unbearable black heads . 
Even with his wand removed , Harry understood that it was useless , for the spiders were too crowded . 
But it still fights to survive . 
Just trying to stand up , suddenly it sounded a loud explosion , long , at the same time , a light shining through the hole . 
Mr Weasley's spell - bound car was running down the slope , bright lights , loud whistles , and running to spit out the spiders . 
Many spider jaws fall down , some long legs dangling out in the air , can not stop . 
The car wins a safe in front of Harry and Ron , the door bursting open . 
Harry yelled : 
- Saving Fang ! 
Soon afterwards , it slipped into the car , sitting in the front seat ; Ron hugged Fang as drowsy as the floating dog just yelped , pushed it into the back seat of the car , and closed the door . 
Ron did not even pedal to the accelerator pedal , the engine automatically rises , and pinch ! - both spiked away , tossed some more spider mice as they fall overloaded class . 
The speeding motor jumped up the slope , got out of the hole , and soon crossed the forest , bewildered by the branches of the trees . 
But the car is also clever , knowing how to find each empty space that runs , in a way that it seems to know the way clearly . 
Harry looked at Ron . 
Ron's mouth was still open in unbelievable screams , but his eyes were no longer visible . 
- Do not you ? 
The car dodged a great oak tree 
Ron looked straight ahead , unable to speak . 
As the car rolled through the low bushes , Fang began to recapture the barking and scrambling from the back seat . 
Harry saw the rearview mirror was flying when the car dodged a great oak tree . 
After about ten minutes of hard - hitting , the trees were prickly , and the Harrys saw the empty sky above . 
Suddenly the car stalled , causing them to nearly hit the windshield . 
So it came to the edge of the forest . 
Fang leaned out of the window , anxious to get out of the car as quickly as possible . 
As Harry opened the car door , the dog spun out like an arrow , dashed past the trees , toward Hagrid's house . 
Harry also got off the bus , and a minute or two later , Ron seemed to be restless , his limbs began to feel , and it mimicked Harry to climb out of the car , his eyes still dull and his neck still stiff . 
Harry patted on the car expressing gratitude . 
The car went into the forest and for a moment was gone . 
They returned to Hagrid's hut to retrieve the Cloak sheet . 
Fang was still trembling under the blankets covered in his nostrils . 
When Harry came out , he saw Ron hurriedly vomiting in Hagrid's pumpkin garden . 
Ron wiped his sleepless shirt and whispered , 
- I will not forgive Hagrid . 
Listen to him : follow the spiders ! 
It is thanks to the blessings of his grandparents who have survived back here . 
Harry said : 
" I can not believe that Hagrid did not think Aragog would hurt Hagrid's friends like that . " 
Ron still has a plate , punched a fist in the wall of the hut : 
- That's exactly his scourge ! 
He thinks the monsters are not as horrible as the rumors . 
Let's see , where did that bring him ? 
Prison Azkaban ! 
Now Ron's voice was shaking uncontrollably : 
- And he understands what the spiders are going to do there ? 
Now I want to know that this adventure helps us find something ? 
Harry rolled the cover of Cloak to cover both of them and slung Ron under his arm , helping you to go to the castle . 
- Uncle Hagrid wants to tell us that he is innocent , he did not open the door of the Chamber of Secrets . 
The two carefully walked up to the lobby and climbed up the marble stairs 
Ron snorted in disbelief . 
Obviously , according to Ron , hatching spiders in the closet can not be considered innocent . 
As the ball of the castle loomed in front , Harry corrected the shirt so that even their feet were covered , then pushed the huge oak door out . 
They carefully walked up to the lobby and climbed up the marble staircase , holding their breath as they passed through the corridors , where the guards were on their way to the watch room . 
Finally , they were safe to go to Gryffindor's common room . 
That fire burns to ashes . 
They took off their coats , climbed up the stairs to their bedroom . 
Ron rolled to bed , not even taking off his shoes or changing clothes . 
However , Harry did not feel sleepy . 
He sat on the edge of his bed , thinking about what Aragog had said . 
He thought , the monster hovering somewhere in the castle sounded like a monster Voldemort - a monster that even horrible monsters do not want to mention the name . 
But the secret about that monster is still intact , what is it , how to kick the victims ? 
Both Ron and Harry bear , have not found . 
And perhaps even Hagrid was unaware of the Secret Chamber that contained the secret . 
Harry retreated to his bed , sat back against the pillow , watching the moon go through the windows of the Gryffindor Tower . 
He thought he was bored and did not break down what they could do . 
Followed by the clue that they also go to the dead end . 
Riddle got the wrong person , Slytherin's successor was over , and no one was as sure as this was the same person who opened the Secret Chamber door , or another one came out . 
No one in this castle could have answered Harry . 
There was nobody to ask Harry . 
He lay down , still thinking about what Aragog had said . 
When the dreaming dream is about to fall asleep , suddenly an idea pops up as if it was the last hope . 
Immediately Harry sat up : 
- Ron Ron 
Harry whispered in the darkness . 
Ron was awake , looking like Fang , looking round , and seeing Harry . 
Harry shakes Ron up , whispering in Neville's thunder in the corner : 
- Ron the girl was dead . 
Aragog says her body is found in the bathroom . 
Maybe she was not out of the bathroom , maybe she was still there ? 
Ron rubbed his eyes , his face scowling in the moonlight . 
But then it suddenly came to understand . 
- You think it's a ghost crying Myrtle ? 
Chapter 16 : CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY 
At breakfast the following morning , Ron said bitterly : 
- When we were practicing medicine , we spent all day and hours in the toilet , but the crying ghost was just three of us , but then we could have asked her . hey now 
Now want to meet ghosts crying Myrtle also dangerous life is not miserable to find the spider mice . 
How to escape the professor a long enough to sneak into the women's toilet , ( female toilets ) , so the female toilet is next to the scene has occurred the first attack . 
It does not sound like a viable feat . 
But in the first lesson of the session , at the turn of events , a problem arose out of the minds of the children of the obscure Chamber of Secrets . 
For the first time in many weeks , the kids have a bigger concern over the monster loophole in the Secret Room . 
Professor McGonagall , after learning about ten minutes , told the children about the exam schedule . 
The exam will start in early June , if it counts from the announcement , only one more week . 
As soon as he heard it , Seamus screamed : 
- Thi ? 
Do we still have to take exams ? 
There was a loud explosion behind Harry , for Neville's wand fell off and hit a table foot . 
Professor McGonagall immediately wielded his wand with his wand . 
The professor turned to Seamus , sternly , coldly said : 
- The whole reason for the school to remain active these days , is to give the students a good education . 
So the exams are still as normal , and she believes that all of them will try hard to study hard . 
Study hard ! 
Harry could not even think of still having to test when the castle was in such a situation . 
All around the room , louboutin pas cher , McGonagall made more and more irritating : 
- Dumbledore's directive is to try our best to keep our school normal . 
And , perhaps , she does not need to say that , which means that the quality of her learning this school year must be guaranteed , and how much she will learn . 
Harry looked down at the two white rabbits that were supposed to turn into two slippers . 
How much did he learn this school year , up to now ? 
Its knowledge is not enough for an exam . 
Ron's face was even worse than Harry's . 
Ron's face was as if he had just been ordered to go to the Forbidden Forest . 
Ron raised his wand and asked Harry : 
- Can you imagine yourself going to do magic with this wand ? 
The wand began whistling . 
Three days before the first exam , Professor McGonagall made another note at breakfast . 
The professor said : 
- You have good news , the whole hall , instead of silence , hastily hurried up : 
- Brother Dumbledore comes back ! 
A little girl at the Ravenclaw's house yelled : 
- has captured his successor Slytherin ! 
Wood grows like thunder : 
- Continue Quidditch matches ! 
As the rumblings settled down , Professor McGonagall said : 
- Professor Sprout informed her that ginseng is now mature enough for harvesting and processing . Tonight , we can revive those who have been petrified . 
You do not need to be sure you understand , as one of those petrified people may tell us who or what attacked them . 
She hopes that when this terrible school year ends , the culprit is arrested . 
Immediately a loud cheering broke out . 
Harry stared at the table at Slytherin's table and saw that Draco Malfoy did not even respond , and Harry was not surprised . 
However , Ron was happier than the past few days . 
She said to Harry : 
- So we do not need to ask ghosts crying Myrtle do ? 
Maybe Hermione will have all the answers when she wakes up . 
Well , to see her , she will go crazy fever when the only three days to start exam . 
Throughout time , Hermione was educated . 
It is better to leave Hermione to petrify than to resurrect her now . 
Just wait for the exam and then resurrected Hermione is better ? 
At that moment , Ginny sat next to Ron . 
She looked very stressful , anxious . 
Harry noticed that her hands on each other lined up miserably . 
What's up ? 
Ron just added his own porridge and asked his sister : 
- What's up ? 
Ginny did not say anything , but glanced up into Gryffindor's table with a fearsome face that reminded Harry of a person , but he could not think of anyone . 
Ron still looks at his sister , saying : 
- Just say it . 
Suddenly Harry thought about who Ginny was . 
She swayed in her chair , looking exactly like Dobby when the elf was about to reveal the forbidden secret . 
Ginny carefully avoided looking up at Harry , murmuring , 
- I have to tell you one thing . 
Harry asked : 
- What thing ? 
Ginny seems to be picking up words . 
Asked Ron impatiently : 
- What ? 
Ginny said , but could not speak . 
Harry leaned forward , whispering so that only Ron and Ginny could hear : 
- Is it something related to the Confidential Chamber ? 
Do you see something ? 
Has anyone acted monstrously ? 
Ginny took a deep breath and when she was about to start speaking , Brother Percy appeared , looking pale and exhausted : 
- If you have finished eating , give it to you , Ginny . 
You are starving . 
He just finished the patrol night watch patrol . 
Ginny jumped out of the chair as if shocked . 
She peeked at Percy with her scared eyes , avoided her , and walked away quickly . 
Percy sat down , reaching for the tea pot placed in the middle of the table . 
Ron said , 
- Brother Percy ! 
Ginny is about to tell us something important . 
Percy took a sip of tea and stopped choking . 
He coughed up : 
- What is the story ? 
- I just asked him if he saw something unusual , and he was about to say it 
- Oh , that thing , there was nothing to do with the Secret Chamber . 
Percy brushed off . 
Ron raised his eyebrows and asked : 
- How do you know ? 
- Well , you gotta know it's the other day Ginny happened to catch me up , do not worry about it anymore , the problem is he caught me doing something he , oh , he kept it Please do not say it all for everyone . 
He had to admit that Ginny was very closed - mouthed , keeping his word . 
Actually , there is nothing , actually you should 
Percy seemed so miserable , Harry had never seen him act like that . 
Ron grinned , asking : 
- What was he doing at that time , Percy ? 
Let's say , we do not laugh at you . 
Percy did not even smile : 
- Harry , give you some loaves of bread . 
He is dying of starvation . 
Harry knew that without their involvement , the whole secret of what had happened in the castle could still be found . 
However , if there is a chance to chat with the ghost crying Myrtle then it will not be ignored . 
How delighted it was when the opportunity suddenly came up , in the middle of the morning , when they were being led by Lockhart to the Classroom in History of Magic . 
Mr. Lockhart had insisted every time that the danger was over , just as soon as another disaster struck , as if to deny the teacher . 
This time , he also very eagerly reassured that nothing is worth worrying , escorting students to go in the corridor to the classroom is not necessary at all , perhaps he had to stay many nights To patrol guard on the fourth floor . 
As the pupil turned around a turn , Mr. Lockhart said , 
- Remember our words to see if it is true or not . 
The first words that petrified people will say when they wake up are : Hagrid himself was the culprit . 
To be honest , I do not agree with Professor McGonagall about these unnecessary security measures . 
Harry whispered , 
- I agree with you . 
Ron was so amazed that he dropped the book in his hands . 
Mr. Lockhart said calmly : 
- Thanks , Harry . 
At that time they had to wait for a long line of students long Hufflepuff passing by . 
Mr. Lockhart said with a measure of generosity : 
- I just want to say that the teachers actually have enough to do , no more need to go to school students in the classroom and watch over night 
Ron understood Harry's intentions to catch Lockhart's words . 
- yes , sir . 
Or you just leave us here . 
There is only one more corridor to come 
Brother Lockhart said : 
- Ron , you know , I think we should do it . 
We must also prepare for our next teaching . 
So he hurried away . 
Ron snorted , 
- Prepare for the next lesson ! 
He rolls his hair up ! 
Anyway , Ron and Harry also had the chance to get away from the Gryffindor schoolgirls who were ahead , swept back and leaped through a small path , hurrying toward the shower of ghostly Myrtle's crying . 
The two boys are excited about the success of this conspiracy , then : 
- Harry ! 
Ron ! What do you do here ? 
It's Professor McGonagall . 
Her two lips were thin and never seen before . 
Ron flicked three flicker : 
- We are going to meet you 
Harry promptly added : 
- Hermione . 
Both Ron and Professor McGonagall looked at Harry . 
He stomped on Ron's leg and then said , 
" Miss , we have not met Hermione for a long time . 
We were going to sneak up , letting Hermione know that ginseng was close enough and telling Hermione to just relax , do not worry anymore . 
Professor McGonagall still looks at Harry , making her believe that only a fraction of a second she will explode . 
But when she spoke , her voice was oddly husky : 
- Of course 
Harry and Ron looked at Professor McGonagall's eyes with sparkling tears . 
She continued : 
" Of course you understand this , friends in such a crash , it is a great challenge . You understand . 
Oh , Harry , of course I was allowed to visit Hermione . 
She will tell Professor Binns where to go . 
Remember to tell Mrs. Pomfrey she has allowed . 
When Harry and Ron walked away , they still could not believe they had escaped a ban . 
At the corner of the wall , they heard the nasal spray of Professor McGonagall . 
Ron said enthusiastically : 
- What is the best story you made ? 
But they could not afford not to say to Pomfrey that Professor McGonagall was privileged to allow them to visit Hermione . 
Mrs. Pomfrey gave them a grudge . 
She said : 
- Talk to the petrified , what the hell ? 
It was not until we sat down next to Hermione that the two of them admitted that Pomfrey's comment was justified . 
Obviously , there was no sign that Hermione knew that she was visiting , or understood their caring cheerfulness beside the bed . 
Hermione's lifeless expression , Ron's deep sadness : 
" I wonder if Hermione sees anyone attacking me ? " 
Because if the person who sneaks in for a break , who knows who it is ? 
But Harry did not look at Hermione's face . 
She noticed the baby's right hand . 
Hands clenched on the blankets across him . 
As Harry leaned closer , he saw a crumpled paper in Hermione's grasp . 
Looking around to make sure Pomfrey was not present , Harry showed Ron . 
Ron whispered : 
- Try to get it out . 
She pulled the chair to shield Harry from the sight of Mrs. Pomfrey . 
It was a book page torn from a very old book in the library . 
Work is not easy either . 
Hermione's hand clutched the paper so hard that Harry was about to tear it off . 
While Ron was busy guarding , Harry struggled for a few moments of tension to remove the paper . 
It was a book page torn from a very old book in the library . 
Harry eagerly brushed the paper straight and Ron sat down and read : 
Among the fearsome monsters and wandering monsters wandering in our land , no more strange and dangerous creatures than the Basilisk . [ Basilik is a snake with a look and dead breath in mythology ) , also called Tu Xa . 
This snake can live for hundreds of years , and reaches great size . 
It was embryoed in a chicken egg , but was hatched by a toad . 
The way of killing it is strange : in addition to deadly venomous canine teeth , all those who meet the eyes of Tu Xa , just a look is enough to die immediately . 
Spiders usually flee before Tu Xa appears , because that is their deadly enemy . 
And Tu Xà just ran away when he heard the sound of the crow of the rooster , the rooster crow was the fatality of Tu Xa . 
Underneath these prints there were only two handwriting words that Harry recognized as Hermione's writing . Water gutter . 
It was as if someone had just turned on a light in Harry's head . 
He gasped : 
- Ron , that's it . this is the answer . 
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is the Tu Xa . 
A huge python ! 
So I heard the secret voice throughout the castle , while no one else could hear . It is because I have the ability to hear the language . 
Harry looked up at the bunkers around him . 
Tu Xa kills people by looking into their eyes , but there are no dead people here - because no one is looking straight into his eyes . 
Colin looked at it through the camera . 
The sight of Zi Xa burns all the film in the camera , and Colin is petrified . 
And Justin Justin must have seen Tử Xà through Nick's transparent body 
The head of the Ravenclaw family was discovered with a mirror next to him , but the ghost could not die again . 
Hermione must have realized that the monster was Zodiac . 
I bet that Hermione immediately advised the first person she met is to use a mirror to look at the corners before passing . 
And my sister Ravenclaw pulled out a mirror and 
Ron's mouth opened again . 
He asked impatiently : 
- And Mrs. Noris ? 
Harry thought for a moment , envisioning the night scene of the Ma Society . 
It speaks slowly : 
Myrtle's crying bath was flooded with water . 
I guess Miss Noris just saw the reflection ball 
Harry eagerly followed the paper in his hand . 
The closer you read , the better . 
She reads out loud : 
- the roar of the rooster is a deadly disaster for Tu Xa . 
Little Hagrid's cock was killed . 
The Slytherin successor does not want to have a rooster around the castle once the Secret Chamber is opened . 
Spiders often escape before Tu Xa appears ! 
Perfect fit ! 
Ron still wonders : 
- But how can Zi Xa move around the castle ? 
A giant snake must have someone see it ? 
But Harry pointed to Hermione's two handwriting at the end of the torn page . 
It says : 
- Water pipe . 
The hose is right , Ron ! 
It uses plumbing to move . I heard a mysterious voice from within the walls . 
Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm . 
Its voice is different : 
- Secret Entrance Entrance ! 
It was a shower ! 
It's in the right place 
Harry continued : 
Myrtle's crying shower ! 
The two of us sitting there , hardly believe it , whole body in a state of agitation . 
Harry said : 
- This means that I'm not the only Xà Khẩu in Hogwarts . 
The Slytherin successor is also a Sacz . 
Thanks to that , he controls Tu Xa . 
Ron blinked . 
- What do we do now ? 
Should we go directly to Professor McGonagall ? 
Harry stood up , 
- go ! 
We went to the professor's room . 
Ten minutes later she was there . 
It's almost time to play . 
Both of us ran down the stairs . To avoid being caught out in the corridor , Harry and Ron went straight to the professor's room at that time . 
This room was large , with wooden boards , full of dark wood tables and chairs . 
Harry and Ron were nervous , unable to sit still , walking around the room . 
But the sound of the bell signaling the hour never came . 
Rather than the sound of Professor McGonagall's bell , which had been magicked to increase the tone several times , was reverberating across the hallways : 
- All students return to their bedroom immediately . 
All professors , please come back to the professor's room immediately . 
Harry turned to look at Ron : 
- Could it be another attack ? 
Maybe this time ? 
Asked Ron frantically . 
- What are we doing ? 
Back to the bedroom ? 
- Are not . 
Harry looked around . 
On the left there was a closet , of ugly clothes , filled with professors ' robes . 
He told Ron : 
- Come in . to hear what's going on 
Then we will answer what we just know . 
The two hid in the closet , listening to the rush of hundreds of people are stepping on top of them . 
Then the door to the professor's room opened . 
Between the robes smelled moldy , two eyes glanced at the teachers are pulling in the room . 
Some look very bewildered , some of them can not hide their faces . 
Then Professor McGonagall came in . 
The professor spoke in a very quiet room : 
- Again , another attack occurred . 
One student was taken away by the monster . bring the Secret Chamber of Secrets . 
Professor Flitwick cried out a scream . 
Professor Sprout held his hands up his muzzle . 
Snape snapped his chair back . 
- How do you know that ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Slytherin's successor left a message . 
Just below the first message . 
Her skeleton will be permanently in the Confidential Chamber . 
Professor McGonagall was as white as a white paper . 
Professor Flitwick cried . 
Mrs. Hooch sat down on a chair . 
She asked : 
- What game ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Ginny Weasley . 
Harry felt Ron quietly fall down on his mantle , beside him . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- We will have to send all students home tomorrow . 
So it's like Hogwarts is over . 
Dumbledore always said 
The door to the professor's room suddenly opened . 
In a moment of mythical hope , Harry prayed for the man who entered Dumbledore . 
But it turned out to be Mr. Lockhart . 
He smiled : 
- Yeah , I'm sorry I just slept a moment Do not know what I missed out on ? 
He did not even notice that other professors were looking at him with a look of hatred . 
Mr. Snape stepped forward : 
- The right person is the right thing . 
This is the savior ! 
Mr. Lockhart , a girl was kidnapped by the monster . 
Bring back to the Secret Chamber . 
In the end , his chances of winning have also come . 
Brother Lockhart , who is all pale . 
Professor Sprout lamented one more sentence : 
- that's right , Mr. Lockhart . 
Did not you just say yesterday that you knew the entrance to the Secret Chamber ? 
Brother Lockhart stammered : 
- I , me 
Professor Flitwick loudly said : 
" Yes , he himself told me that he knew the secret inside the Chamber of Secrets , right ? 
- T - I say ? 
I do not remember . 
Snape said , 
I remember he said he regretted not having had a chance to punish the monster before Hagrid was arrested . 
Did not you say that the whole thing was so messy that it would have been right from the start if people had given him action because of the situation , was not it ? 
Lockhart's eyes widened as he watched the heavy , rocky faces of his colleagues sitting around . 
He tried to explain : 
- I really do , you misunderstood me 
Professor McGonagall said : 
" Well , we have all entrusted you , Mr. Lockhart . 
Tonight is the best time to do it . 
We will ensure that no one obstructs or dashes to the work that he will do . 
He spoiled himself with the monster . 
After all , he has full freedom to act now . 
Lockhart looked reluctantly , but no one seemed to want to save him . 
Lockhart's look now no longer handsome high . 
His lips trembled , and without a smile full of teeth , he looked like a weak , stupid man . 
He said , 
- I will not go to my office to prepare 
Then he left . 
Professor McGonagall began to heat his nose , saying : 
- Okay , so he's just getting in the way . 
Now the homeroom teacher must explain to his students what has happened . 
Tell them that the first thing to do the next morning is board the Hogwarts Hogwarts home . 
Please note all remaining teachers : Make sure that no student has left the bedroom at this time . 
The professor stood up , and one by one walked quietly . 
That day was probably the worst day in Harry's entire life . 
He sits next to Ron , Fred , and George in one corner of Gryffindor's common room , unable to speak a single word . 
Percy was not in the room . 
He sent the owl to Mr. Weasley and locked himself in the bedroom . 
That afternoon , it was as fast as it had ever been . 
And the Gryffindor common room never looked crowded like that . When the sun was about to fall , Fred and George could not stand the scene longer than that , leaving the bedroom . 
Then Ron opened his mouth , the first time since the two hid in the wardrobe of professors : 
- Ginny knows something , Harry . 
That is why it is captured . What does it know is not something of a joke about Percy . 
Certainly it has discovered something about the Confidential Chamber . That's why it is 
Ron rubbed his eyes , adding : 
- To think , just the reason that , only it pure blood blood strain that 
Harry saw the sun go down , red as blood , slowly sinking to the horizon . 
Seriously it never felt as miserable as it is now . 
If they could do something . 
Whatever . 
Ron said , 
- Harry , do you think there is any hope that Ginny survived ? You see 
Harry did not know what to say . 
Honestly it does not think Ginny is still alive , in any situation . 
Ron asked again : 
- You know what ? I think I have to go to see Mr. Lockhart , tell him what we know , maybe he will try to find a way to keep the Chamber secret . 
I can tell him where we think the entrance to the Confidential Chamber is , and tell him that the monster inside is Zi Xa . 
Because Harry could not think of anything else to do , and he was desperate to do something , so he agreed with Ron . 
All of the Gryffindor students sitting around them were deeply saddened by the Weasley loss , so no one wanted to stop Ron and Harry when they got up , passing the room , Go through the portraiture Ms . Be out . 
It was dark when the two went down to Lockhart's office . 
Listen to what's inside the bag . 
They can hear the murmur , the sound of furniture colliding , the rush of the foot . 
Harry knocked on the door , inside suddenly silent . 
Then the door opened and he opened the narrow doorway that was Lockhart's eyes . 
" Well , Potter and Weasley 
He opened the door a little wider : 
- I'm busy now . 
You have a quick talk about something . 
Harry asked : 
" Teacher , we came to tell you some information . 
We think that this information can help you . 
- Oh no , that's not too bad 
Although only half of Lockhart's face was visible , they realized that he seemed uncomfortable . 
Even so , he opened the door for Harry and Ron to enter : 
- I'm going to be fine 
Lockhart's office was almost stripped . 
Two big chests to open the lid on the floor . 
The slacks full color : jade blue , lilac color , blue color is hastily arranged and piled into a chest . 
In the chest is the book stacked crooked . 
The pictures used to hang the walls , now removed , were placed in boxes on the desk . 
Harry asked : 
Lockhart removed his posters . 
- Teacher , where are you going ? 
Lockhart removed his poster with his real human portraiture out of the door , folded the poster and said , 
- Yes , yes , yes . 
The emergency can not be avoided 
Asked Ron , the ginger voice : 
- What about the fate of your sister , teacher ? 
- Well , about that , unfortunately 
Dodging the eyes of the two children , Mr. Lockhart said as he pulled the drawer and began to scratch the inside of a bag : 
- bad luck no one can hurt more than me 
Harry exclaimed : 
- You are Professor of Anti - Dark Arts that ! 
You can not leave when the dark forces around are darkening things like this . 
Still picking up his belongings , he folded his socks on the mantle , Lockhart murmured : 
- Well , I have to say that when we took this job we did not see in the contract that we had to do something like this . 
- So the doctor ran away ? 
Harry asked again , still unbelievable : 
- You have done a great deal to write a book and then master again 
Brother Lockhart said gently : 
- Books cause misunderstanding 
Harry shouted : 
- But you wrote it ! 
Straight up and look at Harry earnestly , Lockhart said , 
- My son , let's reasonably wake up . 
If one does not believe that we have done all we have written in books , then our books will sell as half as today . Who would have read the story of an ugly Armenians witch , even though he actually saved a whole village from being a werewolf . 
The print on the book cover only makes the reader run away from the bookcase only . 
This man lacked the concept of clothing . 
And the witch has banished Bandon Death Bandits cleanse the lips . I meant to say , only 
- So you have robbed many people to do their own achievements ? 
Harry is still very shocked . 
Lockhart shook his head impatiently : 
- Harry , Harry ! Where are so simple ! 
It takes a lot of effort . 
I have to find out who these people are , then ask how they did the things they did . 
Then we have to let them enjoy our Loch of Mourning to forget all they have done . 
If we only have one thing to be proud of , that's my Charm . 
So , Harry , do the same thing too . You just have to sign the name of the poster . 
Want to have the name must discharge the work , but do not try to punch sticky rice balls . 
Lockhart closed the chest and locked it . 
He murmured : 
- to consider . 
I see that is all right then , everything has finished cleaning up . 
Forgot something ! 
He withdrew the wand and turned to the two children : 
" I'm terribly sorry , boys , but I still have to use the Mysterious Charm on them now . 
We are not going to sell books anymore . 
But Harry also withdrew his wand in time . 
Lockhart had not yet reached his wand , and Harry roared his mantra : 
- Expelliarmus ! [ Meaning : Take a bait to the rats ! ]] 
Lockhart was shot in the back , falling into the chest . 
The teacher's wand flew into the air . 
Ron grabbed it and threw it out the window . 
We should not have let Snape teach us that . 
Harry said in anger , kicking the chest on the floor . 
Lockhart looked up to see Harry pointing his wand in his face , face down , pale , weakly said : 
- What do you want me to do ? 
I really do not know where the Secret Chamber is . 
I can not really do anything . 
Furiously pointing his wand at Lockhart , Harry urged him to stand up , saying , 
- May I tell you that we know where it is . 
And know what's inside there . 
Let's go . 
Harry and Ron escorted Lockhart out of the office , down the nearest staircase , down the dark corridor , toward the wall of the illuminated ghostly message , and to the coyote's crying cubicle . Myrtle . 
The two little boys pushed Lockhart forward . 
Seeing trembling , Harry whimpered . 
Myrtle crying on the water tank at the end of the chamber . 
Seeing Harry , the ghost said , 
- Oh , we're here again . 
What do we want now ? 
Then we hear someone go to the toilet . 
Harry said : 
- Just want to ask how she died ? 
Myrtle's crying face immediately changed . 
It seemed as excited as ever to have nobody ever asked him a flattering sentence like that . 
Myrtle said with particular interest : 
- Oh ! 
What a shabby soul . 
It happened right here . 
I died on this toilet bowl . 
I remember very well . 
I was hiding here because Olive Hornby brought my glasses out to tease moles . 
I lock the bathroom door , then I sit here crying . 
Then we hear someone go to the toilet . 
Someone talked very funny . 
I think they speak in a different language . 
But at that moment , I was also shocked , because that is the voice of the son . 
So I open the door to the bathroom , to tell the boy to go somewhere else , or to the bathroom . Then 
Myrtle reached up , looking extremely important , the ghostly face : 
- Then I die . 
Harry asked again . 
- How dead ? 
- Who know ! 
Myrtle said in a closed voice : 
- I just remember seeing a big yellow eyes . 
All our bodies are grasping , and then we float away 
The ghost looked at Harry and said , 
- And then I come back . 
Know what to spend ? 
I decided to hint Olive Hornby for hate . 
Oh , that little girl had to regret how much she laughed at my glasses . 
Harry still wonders : 
- You see the eyes exactly where ? 
Myrtle pointed to the sink in front of him . 
- Where is it ? 
And then Harry saw : a tiny snake was scrawled on one side of the brass water tap . 
Harry and Ron rushed over to look at it . 
Mr. Lockhart was careful to stand a few feet away from the safe - sounding , horrified look on his face . 
The sink looks like any normal sink . 
The two children carefully scrutinized each and every one of them , both inside and outside , the pipes beneath the pot . 
And then Harry saw : a tiny snake was scrawled on one side of the brass water tap . 
Seeing Harry twist the faucet , the wailing ghost Myrtle said , 
- The faucet is broken from time to time ! 
Ron suddenly reminded : 
" Harry , what's going on , what's in that tongue ? " 
Harry thought wistfully : 
- But 
The occasions when Harry slips his tongue out of the tongue are the times when he encounters real snakes . 
Now look at the drawing of a tiny snake , it must try to imagine the snake a little . 
Finally , Harry said : 
- Open ! 
He looked at Ron . 
Ron just shook his head : 
- You still speak English . 
Harry looked at the serpent , hoping that his eyes would fade as he saw it as a real snake , a living snake . 
Harry shook his head , candlelight shimmering to create hallucinations as if the snake also moved . 
Harry said again : 
- Open ! 
Suddenly , a strange hissing sound came from his mouth , and suddenly a splash of white light flashed from his cock and began to spin . 
A second later , the pot began to move . 
Actually , the pot down , exposed in front of everyone a huge water pipe , a pipe large enough for an adult to enter . 
Harry heard Ron breathe out , he looked up and decided what to do . 
It says : 
- I ' ll go down there . 
It is impossible not to go , once you have found the entrance to the Secret Chamber , even if only a little hope , very delicate , vague and very mythical , is that Ginny can still alive and just being imprisoned in it . 
Said Ron : 
- Me too . 
A moment of hesitation . 
Then Lockhart spoke with a fuzzy smile . 
- Oh , maybe you do not need me ? 
I ' ll show you 
He put his hand on the door knocking out , but both Harry and Ron pointed his wand at him . 
Said Ron : 
- You go down first . 
His face was white , and lost his wand , Lockhart had to rip open to the door of the Secret Chamber . 
Master's trembling : 
- The games , what to do to get what ? 
Harry poked Lockhart in his wand . 
He slipped right down the drain , trying to say , 
- I really do not believe 
But Ron pushed his shoulder lightly , and he slipped into the drainpipe . 
Harry immediately followed . 
He dropped himself on the water pipe , then let go . 
It was as if it was sucking down and slipping away , falling down in endless shadows . 
He noticed that the hoses turned into branches in all directions , but none of them were as large as the tube that drew it down . 
The crotch is also around the crab , zigzag , steep slope . 
Harry knew that he was diving deep down under Hogwarts , deeper than the dungeons . 
Behind it is Ron also down , bumping lightly through the bends . 
They keep slipping in the water pipe forever 
They're all down in the water , so much so that Harry started worrying about what would happen next . 
Until the foot touches the ground , the new tube tilts . the top of the tube snapped up and Harry was knocked out of there , falling down a wet floor in a dark stone tunnel and tall enough to stand upright . 
Lockhart stood up not far away from his place , his face stained , his face white . 
Harry stood up and Ron was thrown out of the tube . 
- Surely we are deep down the field for miles . 
Harry's voice in the tunnel . 
Ron glanced at the murky murky walls around him , remarking , 
- Not at the bottom of the lake . 
The three now look at the thick darkness ahead . 
Harry whispered to his wand : 
- Lumos ! 
With his wand turned into a lamp , Harry said , 
- go ! 
The three of them walked on , the sound of their feet on the wet floor , and the sound of their feet . 
The tunnels were so dark that three people could only see a short distance ahead . So the light of Harry's wand shines on them against the damp wall , which shines brightly behind them with all their might . 
All three carefully stepped forward . 
Harry whispered : 
- Remember , when listening to static , you have to close your eyes . 
But the tunnels are quiet as at the bottom of the tomb . 
The only surprise they heard was the loud sound when Ron randomly stomped on something , which turned out to be the dry skull of a rat . 
Harry lowered his wand to look at the tunnel , noticing the many bones of the small animals . 
Trying not to think of Ginny's fate in the monster's hands , Harry opened his way to the front quickly , turning over a curve of the tunnel . 
Ron sighed , his voice hoarse , 
- Harry , there's something over there . 
They stood watching . 
Harry could scarcely comprehend something terribly large and winding , lying across the tunnel . 
That does not budge . 
Harry gasped , glancing back at them . 
- Maybe it sleeps . 
Lockhart's trembling hands pressed against his eyes . 
Harry turned to look at the monster , his heart pounding painfully . 
His eyes narrowed to the point that he was close to being close but still able to see . 
Harry raised his wand , slowly , very carefully , stepping forward . 
The light at the wand's head illuminated the giant snake's skin , a bright , greenish - looking serpent , lying on the ground . 
An empty skin . 
The snake skin removed from the skin of this snake must be at least seven meters long . 
- Oh ! 
Ron screamed weakly . 
Suddenly , the sound of a strange movement resounded . Lockhart's knees collapsed . 
Ron pointed at his wand , coldly said : 
- stand up ! 
Mr. Lockhart stood up . 
Then suddenly , he kneeled to Ron , punched him to the ground . 
Harry rushed forward , but was late , Lockhart straightened up , gasped , grabbed Ron's wand , and smiled five years on his face . 
He said : 
- The adventure ends here , boys . 
I would take a snapshot of this school , telling people I could not save the pupil in time , and the two of them were mysteriously absent from seeing her tombstone . 
Please , say goodbye to our memory now . 
Lockhart raised his wand with Ron's glue and read the mantra : 
- Obliviate ! [ ( Confusion ) ] 
The wand blast with the power of a small bomb . 
The wand blast with the power of a small bomb . 
Harry held up his head and ran away , slipping away from the snakeskin skin and then back out of it , dodging the pieces of broken walls fall down on him . 
The explosion of the tunnel ceiling shakes violently , causing the scum to fall into the ashes . 
When the ground was quiet , Harry stood up , staring at the broken wall . 
She yelled : 
- Ron ! 
You do not Ron ? 
- I'm here ! 
Ron's voice echoed behind the dense stone as he choked : 
- I do not mind , but our teacher was stung fire , his wand played him a hole ! 
Harry heard the whine and the loud cry . 
It sounded like Ron was locking Lockhart's shin . 
Ron's voice echoed , hearing despair : 
- Now what ? 
I can not walk through this pile of rubble , take a whole lot of time to clean up finished . 
Harry looked up at the ceiling of the tunnel . 
There were huge cracks . 
It has never tried magic to separate large rocks like this , but now is not the time to try to do such a thing . 
Maybe the tunnels are caves deep in the ground ? 
There was another thud and another rumbling sounded behind the pile . 
Harry thought he was wasting his time . 
Maybe Ginny was in the Confidential Chamber for several hours and was waiting for her to come . 
He knew very well what the most important thing he had to do now . 
He called Ron : 
- You wait there . 
Wait there with Mr. Lockhart . 
I ' ll go ahead . 
If I do not come back for another hour 
A quiet silence . 
Then Ron's voice sounded as if it was trying to keep his voice from shaking : 
- I ' ll try to move this pile of stones so that when you get back you have a place to go And this Harry 
Harry tried to inject a little bit of confidence into his voice : 
- Later you meet again ! 
Then he went on his own , crossing the great snakeskin . 
In front of it is a solid stone wall engraved with two giant snakes twisting together . 
Soon he did not hear Ron's voice again . Tunnel around the crooked elbow , turn around and then around . 
All the nerves in Harry's whole body were stretched unhappily . 
Harry just waited for the tunnel to end , but as he reached the end of the tunnel , crawling over the last curve , he saw a doubly terrifying look : in front of him was a solid stone wall Engraved two snake twists on each other . 
The eyes of the serpents are made of glittering jade . 
Harry approached , his throat dry . 
There is no need to force me to think that these rock snakes are real snakes , because the eyes of the snakes look very lively . 
Harry understood what he had to do . 
He cleared his throat , and the jade eyes seemed to blink . 
In a low , trembling voice , Harry hissed : 
- Open ! 
The snakes immediately split , the wall cracking double , expanding . 
Two half - stone walls slid gently out of sight , and Harry , shaking his legs , inhaled , entered . 
Chapter 17 : THE SLYTHERIN MAN 
Now Harry was standing at the end of a very long room , dimly lit . 
The hollow ceiling and high hun smoke are supported by towering columns of stone , on which are carved images of snakes stretching themselves around , forming long shadows squeezed through the dark space pale gray ghost . 
Harry's heart pounded . 
It stood still , listening quietly to the spinal cord . 
Is the Tzu Xa hidden in the dark corner , behind a pillar ? 
And Ginny , where is Ginny ? 
Harry withdrew his wand and held it in his hand , then reached between the solid pillars . 
Each of its faint footsteps resonates in the dark walls . 
He tightened his eyelids closely , only to see enough , and ready to shut down if there were any static . 
The deep eyebrows of the rock snakes seem to follow Harry's steps . 
And a lot of times , Harry's stomach had to reconcile because he thought something was moving . 
At the last stone , a statue of a tall man in the room suddenly appeared in Harry's lap . 
The statue stood against the wall at the back of the room . 
Harry had to stretch his neck to look up at the huge face of his face : an old face wrinkled like a monkey face , with a narrow beard and a long skirt with a long sorcerer . 
Under the slacks of the slacks are big gray legs standing firmly on the flat floor . 
And between the legs is a small figure with red hair lying on the stomach on the floor in black robes . 
- Ginny ! 
Harry screamed , and rushed to Ginny , kneeling beside her . 
Harry urgently lay Ginny : 
- Ginny , do not die , do not die , my dear ! 
Harry tossed the wand aside , hugging Ginny's shoulders , turning her around . 
Ginny's face was white as lime , and her eyes were chillingly cold , which meant she was not petrified . 
But so she was 
Harry eagerly called : 
- Ginny , wake up . 
But Ginny's head just leaned on this side and turned to the other side under Harry's shaking . 
- She will not wake up . 
A soft voice came . 
Harry jerked his head and turned . 
A tall , black - haired teen , leaning against the nearest pillar , was looking at it . 
The strangeness of this teenager made Harry feel like he was looking at him through a foggy window . 
But surely there is a teenager standing there , unmistakable . 
- Tom Tom - Tom Riddle is not it ? 
Riddle nodded , his eyes still staring at Harry's face . 
Harry asked urgently : 
- Ginny will not wake up ? 
What do you mean ? 
Ginny is not Ginny yet ? 
Riddle said : 
- yes , she is still alive . 
But only now . 
Harry looked up at Riddle . 
Tom Riddle used to be a Hogwarts student fifty years ago , but now he's standing here , in a cloud of mist , still young like a sixteen year old . 
Harry wondered asked : 
- Are you a ghost ? 
Riddle quietly replied : 
- I am a memory . 
A memory kept in a diary for fifty years . 
Riddle pointed to the floor , near the giant statue's toes , the black little diary that Harry had picked up in the bathroom of the crying Myrtle crying , was open . 
For a moment , Harry wondered how the diary was located here . 
But right now it has more to do with urgent concern than that . 
She raised Ginny's head : 
- Tom , I have to help you . 
We have to get out of here . 
There is a Tử Xà Em I do not know where it is , but it can appear whenever you please help me 
Harry managed to lift Ginny's body half off the floor . 
Riddle did not move . 
Harry was still sweating to raise Ginny's upper body off the floor . 
He bent down to pick up the wand , but the wand was gone . 
Harry looked up and asked Riddle : 
- Do you see ? 
Riddle stood still staring at Harry , his long fingers twisting Harry's wand . 
As Riddle picked up his wand , Harry raised his hand and said , 
- Thank you . 
But Riddle stood still staring at Harry , his long fingers still wiggling his wand . 
A mysterious smile curved the corners of Riddle's mouth . 
Ginny's immobilized body made Harry's knees gloomy . 
Harry urged : 
- Listen to me . 
We have to get out of here ! 
If the child Xà appears 
But Riddle calmly said : 
- It only appears when called . 
Harry lowered Ginny's back to the floor because he could not hold it any longer . 
He asked Riddle : 
- What do you mean by that ? 
Please give me the wand , you may need it 
Riddle's smile widened . 
It says : 
- You will not need it anymore . 
Harry stares at Riddle : 
- What do you mean ? 
Will not you use it ? 
Riddle said : 
- Harry Potter , I've been waiting for this opportunity a long time ago . 
Opportunity to meet you . to talk to you . 
Harry is no longer patient : 
- Brother Riddle , I see you do not understand anything . 
We are in the Secret Chamber . 
Talk to later 
But Riddle removed Harry's wand from his pocket , still laughing : 
- We ' ll talk right now . 
Harry glared at the Riddle . 
Something very weird going on here 
Slowly , Harry asked , 
- How did Ginny do this ? 
Riddle seemed very relaxed , replied : 
- Well , that's an interesting question . 
And the answer is a long story . 
I think the main reason why Ginny came to this was that she opened her heart and brought her secret to confide in an invisible stranger . 
Harry does not understand : 
- What are you talking about ? 
- About the diary . 
My diary . 
Ginny has been writing my diary for several months , telling me of her grief and distress - what kind of teasing guy he is , what kind of school year All that is used is old , old clothes , old books , which is 
Riddle paused , his eyes glares over , then continued : 
- Well , the great Harry Potter is well known , I suppose , according to her , I do not like it at all . 
During these words , Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face . 
A look of haze . 
Riddle continues : 
- It is too boring to hear all the worries of a baby eleven years old . 
But I'm very patient . 
Tao wrote to her . 
I'm very understanding . 
I'm very considerate . 
Ginny is simply gorgeous : No one ever understands you like you , Tom . How happy I am to have this diary to confide in you . It's like a friend that you can carry with you . in a shirt pocket 
Riddle burst out laughing , the cold , arrogant laughter that seemed not to fit at all . 
The laugh made Harry's hair stand upright . 
- If you have to self - recognize , then Harry , I assume that I always have the ability to fascinate those who need me . 
So Ginny poured out her confidences with me , and incidentally , her mood was exactly what I wanted . I grew stronger , sipping her fears , her darkest secrets . 
I became stronger , and stronger than Ginny very much ; strong enough to begin to clench in her three little secrets , to start pouring a little of my feelings into her 
Harry's throat became dry . 
She asked : 
- What do you mean ? 
Riddle still gentle : 
- Not yet , Harry Potter ? 
Ginny is the one who opened the Secret Chamber . 
It was the little girl who twisted the rooster's neck around the school and painted scars on the walls . 
It was she who dropped the Slytherin Zodiac out of the four Blood Mudbloods and the cats of the old supervisor . 
Harry whispered : 
- There's no such thing ! 
Riddle said calmly , 
- it's true . 
Of course , she was not aware of what she was doing at first . 
Also interesting . 
You read the new diary pages of her . What she wrote so well 
Riddle reads his voice , chanting as he watches Harry's horrified face : 
- Tomorrow , I think I'm losing my memory . 
Your coat is covered with feathers and you do not know what to do . 
Tom , I can not remember what you did on the night of the Mausoleum , but that night there was a cat petrified , and the front of my shirt did not know why the paint was sticking . . 
Mr. Tom , Percy kept saying me gaunt and looked strange . 
I think you have a suspicious image . Today there's another attack Tom , you can not remember where you are Tom , what do you do now ? 
You're going crazy , you have the idea that you're the one who attacked everyone , Tom . 
Harry's hand tightened into fists , his nails deep into the flesh . 
Riddle says endlessly : 
- That stupid Ginny girl takes a long time to trust in her diary . 
Finally , she suspected her diary and tried to throw it away . 
At that time , you , Harry , you yourself have collected the diary and entered . 
Nothing makes me happy when you get my diary . 
Of how many people can get it , the diary randomly fell into your hands , you , the man I was eager to meet 
Anger over Harry , he must try to restrain himself to say the words : 
- Why do you want to meet me ? 
Riddle said : 
" Well , you know , Harry , Ginny , tell me all about you , your fascinating biography . 
Riddle's gaze focused on the lightning scar on Harry's forehead , becoming more and more thirsty : 
" I know I have to find out more about you , talk to you , and if possible , meet you . 
So I decided to show you the arrest of the famous Hagrid idiot , to gain your trust . 
Harry interrupted Riddle , his voice trembling : 
- Hagrid is my friend . 
Did you slander him ? 
I thought you made a mistake , but it turned out you 
Riddle laughed again : 
" Harry , that's just what I'm saying against what Hagrid says . " 
Can you imagine how old Dippet was ? 
On the one hand , Tom Riddle , poor but outstanding , orphaned , very courageous , a model student of the school , a boss . There is a stupid Hagrid who is stupid , Somehow , I managed to raise the werewolf under my bed , then sneaked into the Forbidden Forest to wrestle with the giant demons . But I recognized that I was a little surprised when my plot took place . Better than expected . 
I was worried that someone would realize that Hagrid could not be the Slytherin Successor . 
It took me five years to get to know everything about the Secret Chamber and then to discover the secret entrance to Hagrid to do the same thing ! 
Riddle opened his cold smile and continued : 
- Only Dumbledore , seem to believe that Hagrid is innocent . 
He tried to persuade Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him to hold the lock for Hogwarts . 
Eh , I thought maybe Dumbledore would have guessed the truth . Dumbledore never showed himself like other professors . 
Harry gritted his teeth : 
- Dumbledore looked at his brow , I was so sure . 
" Well , after Hagrid's been kicked out , Dumbledore was sure to keep an eye on me for the rest of my life . 
I know that when I was in school , open the Chamber of Secrets once again is not safe , not wise . 
But how long will it take me to find out it's going to sink back into secret in a wasteful way . 
So I decided to leave a diary , keeping my age of sixteen , so that one day , if lucky , I would be able to lead another person to follow in my footsteps and complete my work . High of Salzly Slytherin . 
Harry said in the voice of the winner : 
- You can not finish that job . 
This time no one died , even the cat did not die . 
Within a few hours the female ginseng will be finished and all the petrified will be revived 
Riddle said coldly , 
- I do not talk to you ? 
That killing the Blood of Mud now no longer mattered to me . 
For months , I was aiming for a new target , you . 
Harry looked at the Riddle . 
" You imagine how angry I was when you opened my diary not you , but Ginny . 
She saw you have a diary , so she was panicking . 
It is scary if you know how to use this diary , know how to write the diary , and I bring her secret to tell you what's going to happen ? 
Or worse , if I told you who had twisted the cock , what would it be ? 
So that little idiot had left at your bedroom empty , sneaking in to steal the diary . 
But I know what to do . 
I see you are tracing the Slytherin Successor . 
What Ginny told me about you helped me to know that you would come to the same end to clear the secret , especially when one of your best friends was attacked . 
And Ginny also told me that the whole school was rumored to be annoying because you could say Bingo 
Harry still looked at Riddle : 
" So I took Ginny to say goodbye to the wall and then came down here and waited . 
She struggled , crying , to get tired . 
But there is not much life left in her . She has plunged so much into her diary , into me . 
So much so that I finally got enough of the force to leave the paper myself . Tao waited for you to appear from me and that girl down here . 
I know you will come . 
I have many things to ask you , Harry Potter . 
Harry's hands still clenched : 
- What to ask ? 
Riddle smiled amusedly : 
- Well , how did you , a newborn baby , have no extraordinary magical talent , to defeat the greatest sorceress of all time ? 
How can you survive unharmed , except for a small scar , while all the powers of Lord Voldemort are destroyed ? 
Speaking of that , Riddle's gaze flickered , showing a strange red light . 
- Why do you care about me escape ? 
Voldemort belongs to your post - birth 
But Riddle responded softly , 
- Voldemort is my past , present , and future , Harry Potter . 
Riddle pulled Harry's wand out of his pocket and began to walk in the air , writing three sparkling words : 
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE 
Then he waved the wand again , the three words arranged themselves : 
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT . [ ( I'm Lord Voldemort ) ] 
Riddle whispered : 
- Do you understand ? It's an alias that we used at Hogwarts , but of course it's only close friends . 
Do you think I use the name of my vulgar father Muggle forever ? 
Tao , who brought in the blood of Salazar Slytherin , inherited the lineage of my mother . 
Tao , I bear the surname of a maniacal , stupid Muggle , who abandoned me even before I was born , just to find out that my wife was a witch ? 
No way , Harry . 
I found myself a name , a name I knew someday , when I became the greatest witch in the world , all the other wizards were scared to shake to come 
Harry's brain seems to be jammed . 
He looked blankly at Riddle : Is this an orphan who grew up , and then became the killer of Harry's parents and so many others ? 
Harry had to say the same words : 
- You do not 
Riddle throat blocked : 
- Nothing ? 
Harry gasped : 
- Not the greatest witch in the world . 
Sorry to disappoint you , but the greatest sorcerer in the world is Mr. Albus Dumbledore . 
Everybody said that . 
Even if you were strong , you would not dare to try to take Hogwarts with Dumbledore , who saw through your heart when you were a kid at school , and until now you are still afraid . Teacher , no matter where you hide 
The smile disappeared on Riddle's face . 
Instead , it is a vicious vicious look . 
It hissed : 
- Remember , just use my memory that I have kicked old Dumbledore out of this school offline ! 
Harry protested : 
- You do not go always like you think ! 
Harry just said so , hoping to scare Riddle , but in the heart , though very dreaming , it also dare not believe it is true . 
But Harry had just finished speaking , echoing somewhere , an ethereal sound of music that made Riddle just open his mouth to say stunned . 
He turned around the length of the Secret Chamber of Empires . 
Elegant , exotic , supernatural , mysterious to spine - busting , it drained all of Harry's hair and made his heart bloom twice as large as normal . 
Then , as the music reached the point that Harry felt as if the sound was shaking in the frame , the light flashed to the top of the nearest pillar . 
Turns out , a large red swan bird appears , pouring melodious music throughout the ceiling of the room . 
The bird has long tail tha grace as gold fair tail , the claws are gold in gold , clawed in gold claws is a rattlesnake . 
Harry looked up , saw a long and sharp gold mine , and a pair of dark , rounded eyes . 
In a split second , the bird flew straight to Harry . 
She let go of the tentacle that was spreading under her feet , then heaved to Harry's shoulders . 
As the bird folded its wings , Harry looked up , saw a long and sharp gold bat , and a pair of dark round eyes . 
The bird stopped singing . 
He sat on Harry's shoulders , giving a warm breath to his cheek , while his bright eyes stared at Riddle . 
Riddle also threw his sharp eyes at the bird , muttering : 
- A phoenix 
Harry exhaled : 
- Must be Fawkes ? 
He felt the gold claws of the phoenix lightly on his shoulders . 
The Riddle was now eyeing the tattered stuff like the tattered rag that Fawkes dropped on the floor : 
- That's the Hogwarts School Hats 
Yes it is . 
The filthy , messy , patchy patch , lying dormant at Harry's feet . 
Riddle started laughing again . 
He laughed so loud that the dark room shook with laughter , as if the ten Riddle boys were laughing for a while . 
- This is what Dumbledore sent to his guardian ? 
A bird singing with an old hat . 
Do you feel more courageous , Harry Potter ? 
Are you sure you feel safe now ? 
Harry did not reply . 
He did not know that the Fawkes or the Sorting Hat would do anything , but at least he was not alone , and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with increasing courage . 
Riddle still laughed out loud : 
- go to work , Harry Potter . 
We have met twice - once in your past and once in my future . 
And twice I killed you . 
How can you survive ? 
Please tell me all . 
The longer you talk , the more you pull on your survival time . 
Harry thought quickly , estimating the situation . 
Riddle had stolen his wand . 
And it , Harry , had the Fawkes and the Sorting Hat , but none of them used a duel . 
Its clearly a disadvantage . Well , but how long Riddle stood there , the more unfavorable for Ginny's life , the less she was , while Harry suddenly noticed , Riddle's shape was slowly becoming clear . If it is necessary to fight with the Riddle , Harry would rather strike early than the long chain . 
Harry said neatly : 
- No one knows why you're out of power when you attack me . 
I do not know . 
But I know why you can not kill me . 
Because my mother sacrificed to save me . 
Harry added , his voice trembling with anger : 
Muggle - born mother . 
Mom blocked your hand to kill me . 
And I saw you really , I saw you last year . 
You are just a rubble . 
You live in a bad way . That is the consequence of all your power to bring you . 
You have to hide . 
You are evil , you are evil 
Riddle's face wrinkled . 
Then he forced an ugly smile : 
- That's so . 
Your mother died to save you . 
Uh , that's a powerful way of explaining it . 
Now I understand . After all , you have nothing special . 
But I keep wondering forever . 
You see , after all , we have strange similarities . 
Even you probably noticed . 
Both of us carry mixed blood between witches and Muggles , orphans , raised by Muggles . 
Perhaps from the time of the great Slytherin , only two Xà Khẩu appear at Hogwarts , that is with you . 
My brothers and sisters even look the same But in the end , it was just luck that saved you out of my hands . That's all I want to know . 
Harry stood still , nervous , waiting for Riddle to raise his wand . 
But Riddle's distorted smile grew wider : 
- Now , Harry , I'm going to teach you a little lesson . This will be a duel between Lord Voldemort - Successor of Slytherin , and famous Harry Potter , along with the best weapons that Dumbledore can give you . 
Riddle threw a laughing look at the Fawkes and the Sorting Hat , then stepped forward . 
Fear spread in Harry's stiff feet . 
He watched Riddle go between two rows of tall stone columns , pausing , looking up at the tall Slytherin stone portrait , hidden in the darkness of thanks . 
Riddle opened his mouth and hissed like a snake whistling , but Harry understood what Riddle was saying : 
- Please tell me , Slytherin , the greatest of the four founders of Hogwarts . 
Harry turned to look at the stone portrait , the Fawkes on his shoulders swiveling as well . 
And in the mouth of the stone statue , something is moving , coming from the bottom of the worm . 
The great rock face of Slytherin is moving . 
Harry was frightened to see the mouth of his rocky face open , each time wider , until it formed a huge black hole . 
And in the mouth of the stone statue , something is moving , coming from the bottom of the worm . 
Harry pushed back until he reached the dark wall of the room , and as he closed his eyes , Harry felt Fawkes's wings flick to his cheek , flying away from his shoulders . 
Harry wanted to shout : do not leave me ! , but in mind also think , how can a phoenix back to the enemy a Tu Xà there ? 
The floor of the Chamber of Secrets shakes as if something heavy had fallen down . 
Harry knew that something was going on ; Though she could not even see her eyes , she could still feel , or loathe , a huge snake stretching out of Slytherin's mouth . 
Harry heard the Riddle hiss : 
- Kill it ! 
Screaming toward Harry . 
Harry heard the heavy body of the snake crawl over the dusty floor . 
Eyes still closed , Harry scampered away in the room , hands outstretched to find the way - in Voldemort's ridiculous laughter . 
Harry stumbled . 
She fell to the stone floor , saw the tongue bloody salty . 
The snake was only a short distance from Harry , Harry heard his creeping sound very close . 
Then a loud , violent explosion , ripped open on Harry's head , followed by something thumping against it , causing it to collapse into the wall . 
Harry waited for the fangs to enter his body . 
Instead , it only listens to more crazy hisses and there is something fierce in the rocks . 
Without stopping , Harry glanced around , just enough to glance at what was going on . 
The giant green elephant was bright , virulent , fat , like an oak tree , rising high up in the air , and its huge , drooping head drummed like drunk in the middle of the pillar . rock . 
While Harry shuddered , ready to shut his eyes , if the serpent turned his head , he realized there was something that disturbed the Zodiac . 
It's Fawkes , hovering high above the giant snake's head . 
The angry fiend like mad , his mouth wide open long fangs like sharp sharp teeth . 
Fawkes dives . 
The long golden beak of the phoenix bird fell down 
Fawkes dives . 
The long golden beak of the phoenix knelt down , and suddenly black blood spilled out , splashing on the floor . 
The tentacled tentacles , a tiny hit is hit by Harry . 
And before Harry could close his eyes , Tu Xap suddenly turned his head . 
Harry looked straight into his face , both big eyes , livid , yellowish , were all phoenixes out . 
The blood of the serpent from the sockets of the eye drifted to the floor . 
The Screaming Son screams in extreme pain . 
Harry heard Riddle scream : 
- ARE NOT ! IS THE FUCKING PEOPLE FOR YOU ! WILD CARE WINNING IN STYLE ! MI GETTING TO GET IT ! Kill it ! 
The blind snake turns around , confused , but still deadly . 
Fawkes hovered round the snake's head , melodious music , occasionally pecking at the serpent's snowy nose , while the blood flowed from the two sockets of Z . 
Harry panicked whispered : 
- Save me , please save me . 
The snake's tail darted across the floor of the room . 
Harry quickly snaps . 
Something soft soft touched Harry's cheek . 
Turns out the snake tattoos hit the hat Classification on the floor , knocked it in the face Harry . 
Harry took the hat . 
In his hand there is now nothing else but a hat , and this is his only chance . 
Harry hugged the hat on his head , leaning to the floor to dodge the hard tail to continue to whip . 
- Help me with - Save me ! 
The cry was in Harry's head when his eyes were clenched under the hat . 
- Please help me 
No answer . 
But the hat suddenly shrank , as if an invisible hand was squeezing it tightly . 
Something fell on top of Harry's head , both hard and heavy , almost crumpling . 
His eyes fluttered with fireflies and his head flashed into his face . 
So he grabbed the top of his lance , pulling it out , feeling like pulling something long and hard underneath . 
It was a silver , white sword , swords of rubies gleamed , each of which was covered with eggs . 
Riddle's screams were still loud : 
- KILL SMALL ! DOGS ! WINNING IN STYLE ! HAPPY HAPPY - HAPPY HAPPINESS ! 
Harry stood up , ready to stand . 
The huge body of the snake curled into a ring and half its body on the ground , its head swinging down , crashing against the stone pillar as it turned to face Harry . 
Harry could see two large openings filled with blood , a large mouth wide enough to devour Harry . 
The mouth jagged as long as fangs of Harry's sword , but still sharp , glistening , and filled with venom . 
Tu barbecue stingy to . 
Harry jumps aside and the snake hits the wall of the Secret Chamber . 
The Deathlord rushed forward again , his split tongue licking out Harry's side . 
With both hands , Harry raised his sword . 
With all his strength in his grip , Harry stabbed a snake into the snout's throat . 
Zzong rushed forward , and this time it was targeted correctly . 
With all his strength in his grip , Harry stabbed a snake into the snout's throat . 
But as soon as the hot blood rushed down Harry's arm , it felt a sharp pain coming from his elbow . 
A long , fangled fanged teeth crept into Harry's skin , as it sank deeper into his arms and broke apart as the Tufts sank to one side and collapsed to the floor , writhing . 
Harry leaned against the wall , slowly knocking . 
He grabs the solid fangs that infuse the poison into his body , pulling out of his arm . 
But he knew it was too late . 
The burning pain slowly spread from the wound . 
Just as he dropped his fangs and saw blood flowing into his robes , Harry's eyes faded . 
The Chamber of Secrets whirls into a blur of color . 
Suddenly a red object flickered , and Harry heard the soft croaking of the clawed claws on the stone floor . 
Harry tried hard to say : 
- Fawkes , you fought very well , Fawkes 
Harry felt like the bird was putting his head on his arm , the wound where the snake teeth had left . 
Then he heard footsteps echoing and a dark shadow appeared in front of him . 
Riddle's voice echoed above his head : 
- You're dead , Harry Potter ! 
Death . 
Even Dumbledore's bird knows that . 
Do you see what it does , Harry ? 
It was crying . 
Harry blinked . 
He glimpsed the head of Fawkes while hiding in front of him . 
Beautiful phoenix tears like rolling pearls down to the feather . 
- I will sit here looking at you dead , Harry Potter . 
Slowly , I'm not in a hurry . 
Harry was still in Tom Riddle's dream state . 
Everything around it seemed to be spinning . 
Riddle's voice sounds distant : 
- The end of Harry Potter's famous life is so it ! 
Desperate in the Secret Chamber , abandoned by his friends , defeated by the Dark Lord - the lord , who has stupidly challenged , confronted . 
Harry , you ' ll soon see your Muggle chef again . 
She gave her life to buy you twelve years to live temporarily But the Dark Lord has ended your life , as you know it 
If you die like this , Harry dreamily thinks , it's not bad at all . 
Even the pain in his arm bitten by a snake was no longer painful 
Beautiful phoenix tears like rolling pearls down to the feather . 
But are you really dying ? 
Why does the Chamber of Secrets not darken like a smoking pot , like hell , but as it is gradually evolving ? 
Harry shook his head , then he saw the phoenix Fawkes still resting his head on his arm . 
A series of tear - like pearls shining brightly around the wound - but no injuries . 
Riddle shouted : 
- Avoid that bird ! 
Take it off - I told you , avoid it 
Harry looked up . 
Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at Fawkes ; an explosion resounded as gunfire , and Fawkes took off in the midst of a yellow , purple vortex . 
Riddle stared at Harry's wound , quietly saying , 
- I forgot the eyes of the phoenix Right then there is the power to heal the wound , have the power to revive . 
Riddle looked at Harry's face : 
- But not change anything . Actually , I like this more . 
Only with me , Harry Potter you with me 
Harry grabbed the fanged Tu Xa's fangs on the floor , thrusting at him with his fangs in the center of his diary . 
He raised his wand 
At that moment , Fawkes flew back , flapping his wings , hovering over Harry's head and dropping Harry's thighs a log . 
In just half a second , both Harry and Riddle , raising their wand , gazed at the diary . 
Without thinking , as if he had intended to do so long , Harry grasped the fanged Tu Xa's canine lying on the floor , using his best effort , tossed his fangs in the middle of the book sign . 
A screeching shriek , screams , resounding , prolonged . 
Squirrels erupted from the book into streams , flowing like streams on Harry's arms , soaking the floor of the room . 
The riddle collapsed , writhing , scurrying , struggling , and then 
Riddle disappears . 
Harry's wand fell to the floor , a click sounded , and then there was silence . 
Completely silent , except that the ink droplets continue to rise from the diary and fall to the stone floor . 
Tu Xa's poison burned a hole through the middle of her diary . 
Shivering body , Harry stood up . Its head is still spinning , just like a pastry trip with powdered Floo . 
Slowly , Harry gathered up his wand , the Sorting Hat , and the sword that had pulled away from the jawbone's upper jaw . 
At the end of the Chamber of Secrets a little moan sounded . 
Ginny was awake . 
Harry rushed to Ginny's side , helping her up . Ginny's glazed eyes fluttered around the vast room , from the massive figure of dead Death , to Harry in bloody robes , then Harry's diary . 
She opened her mouth slightly , trembling , tears began to flow on her face . 
- Harry , you Harry , I tried to tell you at breakfast , but I can not speak in front of you Percy . 
Harry , that's me , but I swear I did not mean to do those things . Riddle made me do it , forcing me to do that How could you kill that baby ? 
Where's Riddle ? 
I remember the last time I wrote the diary , the picture had gone out of my diary 
Harry held up his diary , pointing out to Ginny that the big hole had been pierced by his fangs . 
- It's over , Ginny . 
Riddle spent his life . 
Look , Riddle and Zi Xa . 
Well , Ginny , we just got out of here . 
Harry glowed and Ginny stood up . 
Ginny cried again : 
- I will be expelled , Harry . 
I have been looking forward to , since Bill entered the school , to enroll in Hogwarts . 
Now that I have to leave school Three with my mother will say this ? 
Phoenix Fawkes is hovering at the entrance to the Secret Chamber , waiting for the two children . 
Harry took Ginny forward . 
They walked through the deadly scroll of the Dead Death , passing through the dark room , only to hear their footsteps , then back to the tunnel . 
Harry heard the rock door close behind him with a small hiss . 
After a few minutes back up the dark tunnels , Harry's ears began to hear the clearing from the distance . 
The two of us just around the corner finally see the face of Ron's impatience . 
- Ron ! 
Shouted Harry . 
Ginny's hand was on the run , Harry shouted : 
- Ginny is all right ! 
I found Ginny ! 
Harry heard Ron somewhere out loud a chuckle . 
The two of us round the corner finally see Ron's impatient face , the other hole is quite large that Ron has been trying to cross the pile of rocks . 
- Ginny ! 
Ron protruded an arm through the gap between the stones to pull Ginny forward . 
She celebrated hysterically : 
- I'm alive ! 
You can not believe it . 
I'm still alive ! 
He was about to hug Ginny , but her whimper stopped him . 
- But okay , Ginny ? 
It's all over now Where's the bird ? 
Fawkes followed Ginny through the hole . 
Harry finally managed to get through the door . 
Harry said : 
- it's Dumbledore's phoenix . 
Ron is still not surprised . 
He glanced at Tom Riddle's shining arm with Harry's hand and asked : 
- How did you get that sword ? 
Harry glanced at Ginny and sniffed , saying , 
- Will explain to you later , get out of this place . 
- But 
Harry interrupted Ron : 
- for later . 
Harry did not feel good talking to Ginny about the girl who opened the door to the Secret Chamber . 
She turned to ask : 
- Where is Mr. Lockhart ? 
Ron grinned . 
He nodded toward the water pipe above the tunnel : 
- Up there . 
He was hit by a fire . come and see . 
Fawkes led the way , thanks to its purple feathers and yellow claws that radiated away the darkness so the tunnels also less dark . 
Mr. Lockhart was still sitting there , calmly modifying himself . 
Said Ron : 
- I have lost my memory . 
At the shock attack that is . 
Wrapped up his self , turned out his staff beat him back . 
Now he can not remember who he is or who we are or where he is . 
You have to ask him to wait here . 
Now the most dangerous thing for me is master . 
Lockhart gazed at the children silently . 
He said : 
- Ladies and gentlemen . 
Is this too bad ? 
Do you live here ? 
Harry bent down to look at the long and deep black pipe . 
He asked Ron : 
- Do you think we can go back on this tube ? 
Ron shook his head , but Fawkes phoned down in front of Harry and waved his wings , Fawkes ' pearly eyes shining in the dark . 
He waved his long golden tail . 
Harry looked at the moon phoenix , not sure what it is . 
Ron looks confused : 
- Looks like he wants to cling to it but the bird is big and you're too heavy , what's up with you ? 
Harry remembered Dumbledore's words . 
- Fawkes is not a mere bird . 
He told the others : 
- We must hold each other tight . 
Ginny , hold on to Ron , Lockhart 
Ron reminds Lockhart : 
- She said that . 
He gripped Ginny's other hand 
All of them suddenly extraordinary light , and in a split second , with a fluttering wing gently . 
Harry stuck the sword and the hat Sorting his waistband , he reached out and grasped the strange feathers of the Phoenix Fawkes . 
All of them suddenly extraordinary light , and in a split second , With a flapping wing lightly , all fly up , hovering in the water pipe . 
Harry could hear Lockhart slammed underneath him , uttering admiration : 
- Strange ! 
Strange too ! 
It's like magic ! 
The wind blowing through Harry's hair , he had not yet gotten a chance to enjoy the flight with the phoenix , the flight was over . 
The four of them touched the floor of the wet bathroom - the ghost's lair of Myrtle . 
And while Lockhart prepared his headpiece , the sink slipped gently to the old place , obscuring the secret pipe . 
Myrtle rolled his eyes at the children . 
The ghost said to Harry awkwardly : 
- Well , we're still alive ! 
Harry grinned , wiping the blood on his shirt and blot on his glasses , comforting Myrtle : 
- There is no need to be so disappointed , Myrtle . 
Myrtle said in a shy voice : 
- Oh , there's nothing I just think if we're dead now , then we're comfortable sharing the rest room with me . 
- Hey ! 
Ron stuck out his tongue and ran out of the toilet to get out of the dark hallway . 
Harry Potter : 
- Hey , Harry , I see Myrtle more and more like that . 
Ginny , I have a rival ! 
But tears like rain on Ginny's face . 
Ron looked at Ginny nervously , and he asked Harry , 
- Where are we going now ? 
Harry : Fawkes is leading the way , the glittering yellow glow in the hallway . 
The stranglers followed the phoenix , and only a moment later they reached Professor McGonagall's office . 
Harry knocked on the door , then pushed open the door . 
Chapter 18 : DOBBY's REWARD 
It took awhile for the whole room , as Ron , Harry , Ginny , and Lockhart appeared at the doorway , full of sticky trash , and blood too ( in Harry's case ! ) ; Then shouted : 
- Ginny ! 
It was Mrs. Weasley , who was still crying in front of the fireplace . 
She stood up , and Mr. Weasley got up with his wife , both of whom embraced Ginny's little daughter . 
However , Harry did not pay attention to the joys of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley . 
He saw behind them , Professor Dumbledore standing by the mantelpiece , smiling , while Professor McGonagall , standing next to him , clasped his hands on his chest while panting . 
The Phoenix Fawkes glided past Harry's ear and landed on Dumbledore's shoulder . 
Then , at that moment , Harry realized , both Ron and Ron , were hugged in Mr. Weasley's arms . 
- I saved you ! 
You saved Ginny ! 
How can you do that ? 
Professor McGonagall also said , 
- I think we all want to know that . 
Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry . He hesitated for a moment , then went to Professor McGonagall's desk , put on it a Sorting Hat , rubbing his sword , and burning the rest of his diary . 
Finished , Harry began to tell everyone everything . 
For almost fifteen minutes , Harry said in the utterly silent silence of the people : it recounted the mysterious invisible voice that he heard in the castle , which Hermione finally discovered was the sound . Speaking of Tu Xà in the water pipe . 
It tells how Ron and Ron watched the infested spiders in the Forbidden Forest , and Aragog told them where the last victim of Death had been killed . 
Then he told how he figured out that the ghost was crying and that Myrtle was the victim , and figured out that the entrance to the Secret Chamber could be in the bathroom . 
As Harry paused for breath , Professor McGonagall asked immediately : 
- Very good ! 
So the games have found the door to the Confidential Chamber , we must add that the game was found after breaking hundreds of school rules into rubbish ; But how in the world can survivors out there , Potter ? 
So Harry , whose voice was beginning to boast of saying a bit more , continued talking about the timely arrival of Fawkes and about the Sorting Hat that had given it the sword . 
But then it began to falter . 
Until then , he kept careful not to mention the Riddle's diary , and avoided speaking to Ginny . 
She was standing on the mother's shoulder , tears still flowing quietly on her cheeks . 
What if people get rid of Ginny ? 
Harry thought that was horrible . 
Riddle's diary is no longer evil . How can it be proved by Riddle himself who sent Ginny to do all this ? 
Instinctively , Harry looked up at Dumbledore . 
A flash of light flashes on the moonlit moonlight . 
Dumbledore said softly , 
What is most interesting about this is how the Dark Lord Voldemort can fascinate Ginny , who , according to his sources , is now hiding in the jungles of Albania . 
Harry felt relieved and warm - a relief of glory surging all over . 
Mr. Weasley uttered in astonishment : 
- C what ? 
Who - knows - who - knows - who ? 
Is it fascinating Ginny ? 
But Ginny Ginny is not , is not Ginny ? 
Harry picked up the diary and gave it to Dumbledore , saying quickly : 
- This is the diary . 
Riddle writes as a sixteen - year - old 
Dumbledore took Harry's diary , pointing his long nose at the scorched and wet paper . 
He said softly : 
- Outstanding ! 
Of course , he is probably the best student of Hogwarts ever . 
He turned to tell the Weasley family looking surprisingly upset . 
Very few people know that Dark Lord Voldemort was also called Tom Riddle . 
I taught you , fifty years ago , at Hogwarts . 
After medical school disappears away and goes deep in the Dark Arts , dealing with the wicked witches in our world , experiencing a lot of change phenomena dangerous , then he changed . The Dark Lord Voldemort , it is hard to see him again . 
No one seems to have any connection between Dark Lord Voldemort and the handsome smart student who was the head of the school . 
Mrs. Weasley asked : 
- But , what about Ginny ? 
What does our Ginny have to do with that guy ? 
Ginny sobbed : 
- The diary ! 
I wrote Riddle's autobiography , and wrote the pictures for him throughout the school year 
Mr Weasley was amazed : 
- Ginny ! 
Have not you taught me anything yet ? 
Did not you ever tell your children something ? Never believe anything that can be thought of once you have no idea where your brain is . 
Why do not you give him , baby , look at the diary ? 
One such suspicious item is clearly full of Dark Magic 
Ginny still sobs : 
- I do not know . 
I found it in the pile of books that my mother bought for me . 
I imagine someone to forget 
Dumbledore's strong voice interrupted the story of the Weasley father : 
- Ginny needs to go to bed now . 
I have gone through a hard time . 
There will be no discipline . 
The older witches are much wiser than they are , but are also duped by the Dark Lord Voldemort . 
Dumbledore strode to the door , opened it , and bent down gently and winked at Ginny , 
- Go to bed and lie down , and maybe also drink a glass of hot chocolate . 
Experienced two dishes that always make him excited . 
Mrs. Pomfrey is still awake . 
She just came out with ginseng vitamin dessert Master dare say that the victims of Tu Xa will awaken for a while . 
Ron exclaimed : 
- So Hermione is fine ! 
Dumbledore reassured Ginny again : 
- There are no more harmful consequences left , Ginny . 
Mrs. Weasley took Ginny out , Mr. Weasley also followed . 
Mr. Weasley's looks are not over yet . 
Dumbledore told Professor McGonagall with a look of anxiety : 
" You know , Mrs. Minerva , all these things deserve to be celebrated . 
I ask you to go down to the kitchen to wake them up for me , okay ? 
- okay ! 
Professor McGonagall responded cheerfully , going to the door and saying , 
- I let you handle Harry and Ron ? 
Dumbledore said : 
- of course . 
Professor McGonagall gone , Harry and Ron watched Dumbledore , not sure what was going to happen to them . 
The professor told Dumbledore how to handle it , exactly what was it ? 
Sure - surely they are not punished ? 
Dumbledore said , 
- I remember saying to you that if you break the rules of the school again , you will have to chase the children . 
Ron gasped . 
- It shows that the most serious of us also sometimes have to swallow his words . 
Dumbledore said with a smile : 
- Both children will be rewarded with a special medal for the School and - for the teacher to see - Ờ , each child is two hundred points for the Gryffindor . 
Ron closed his mouth and began to glow like Radhart's roses on Valentine's Day . 
- But is there one of us who keeps silent about his role in this adventurous adventure ? - said Dumbledore . 
- How so modest , Mr. Gilderoy ? 
Harry was startled . 
It completely forgot Lockhart . 
Looking back , Harry saw Lockhart standing in the corner , still smiling with a grin on his blank face . 
When Dumbledore turned to Lockhart , Lockhart turned his head to see who Dumbledore was talking to . 
Ron said quickly : 
- Dumbledore , when under the Chamber of Secrets there was an accident . 
Professor Lockhart 
- I'm a professor ? 
Brother Lockhart smiled , a little surprised . 
He exclaimed : 
" Oh , my God , I thought I was not expecting anything . 
Ron explained to Dumbledore : 
- Master destined to open the charms to us , we do not hesitate to counter attack , fire in the ghost always . 
- Miserable ! 
Dumbledore shook his head , silver and long bearded dagger : 
- I'm stabbing my back , Gilderoy . 
- What ? 
Lockhart asked loomingly : 
- Where do you have a sword ? That little boy . 
Lockhart pointed to Harry , adding : 
- Say it , it will lend you a sword . 
Dumbledore turned to Ron and said , 
- Master bothered to lead Professor Lockhart through vomiting always . 
He also has something to say to Harry 
Lockhart came out . 
Ron also came out , but peeked a curious look at Harry and Dumbledore as he closed the door . 
Precaution : 
- Sit down Harry . 
Harry sat down , feeling a strange tension . 
Dumbledore's eyes glares when he says : 
- First , I want to thank you , Harry . 
You must have shown me a true loyal heart beneath the Secret Chamber . 
If not , there is no way to call Fawkes to save me . 
Dumbledore stroked the phoenix , and the bird stared at it . 
He said in a carefree way : 
- So I met Tom Riddle . 
I guess you are the one who cares the most 
Suddenly , the thing was tormented Harry suddenly rushed out of his mouth : 
" Sir Dumbledore , Riddle said I was like it . 
It says something weird . 
- Wow , it says that ? 
Dumbledore stared at Harry with bright blue eyes beneath his fierce brows . 
" Then why do you think Harry ? 
Harry did not mean it , but it sounded a bit loud : 
- I do not believe you are like it ! I mean the Son is a Gryffindor student , you are 
But Harry was suddenly silent . 
A suspicion still lurks in his head . 
A moment later , it started again : 
- Teacher , the Sorting Hat tells me you will develop your talents if you go to Slytherin . 
There was a time when everyone thought I was the Slytherin Successor because I was talking Bars 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- Harry , I can speak Bound , because Dark Lord Voldemort can speak Bars . Y is the last descendant of Salazar Slytherin . 
If you do not mistake too much , then he himself gave a little power to me on the night he scaled for me . 
Did not he intentionally do that . 
You must be 
Harry sounded like lightning across his head . 
It cried out loudly : 
- Voldemort handed down some of his powers to me ? 
- Looks like that . 
" So you should be in Slytherin ? " 
Harry looked earnestly at Dumbledore's face . 
" The Sorting Hat has seen the Slytherin in you , have not you ? And the hat 
- Arrange the children in Gryffindor . 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- Harry , I heard you say this . 
By chance , Salazar Slytherin was proud of the students he personally chose . 
I have just had his rare capacity as a prisoner , both resourcefulness , determination , and even defiance of law . 
Dumbledore's beard shakes slightly : 
- But the Sorting Hat still puts her in Gryffindor's house . 
I know why . 
Try thinking . 
Harry said with a frown : 
- It's for me to go to Gryffindor's house just because I asked him not to send me to Slytherin 
- exactly ! 
Dumbledore said , smiling brightly . 
- That made me different from Tom Riddle . 
Harry , it's not just our energy , but our choice to prove who we really are . 
Harry sat motionless in the chair , stunned . 
Dumbledore continued : 
" If you still want evidence that you belong to Gryffindor , then Harry , I suppose you should look at this . " 
Dumbledore leaned over Professor McGonagall's desk , with the silver sword still in his blood , handed to Harry . 
With a quizzical look , Harry took the sword , flipped it over , rubbed the sword at the hilt of the sparkling fire . 
And then he saw at the bottom of a sword carved a name : 
Godric Gryffindor 
Dumbledore said simply : 
- Only a genuine Gryffindor can pull that sword out of the hat . Sort of , Harry . 
For a minute , both teachers did not say anything else . 
Then Dumbledore opened a closet for Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a goose feather and a squid . 
- Now , Harry , what you need is to eat and sleep . 
I suppose you should go down to the kitchen to enjoy a party , while you write a letter to Azkaban . - We need to get our locker back to school . 
And he also wrote an ad for the Prophet Daily . 
Dumbledore added , thinking thoughtfully . 
- We will also need a new professor to teach the art of anti - black . 
Misery of our body , it seems that we have exhausted people to do this thing right . 
Harry stood up and walked to the door . 
But it just touched the doorknob , the door burst open , so strong that it burst into the wall . 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy was at the door , his face angry . 
And the guy behind his back was Dobby , wounded , wrapped in ice . 
Dumbledore said with delight : 
- Hi Lucius Malfoy . 
Mr. Malfoy nearly crushed Harry as he crossed the room . 
Dobby threw himself under his feet , slipping under his jacket , his face looking miserable . 
Malfoy's cold eyes stared at Dumbledore . 
Mr Malfoy said : 
- Then he came back . 
The school administration suspended his position , but he remained ignorant and returned to Hogwarts . 
Dumbledore smiled serenely . 
- Well , you see , Mr. Malfoy , today eleven members of the Board have contacted me . 
Strictly speaking , nothing like being trapped in a dead end . 
They heard about the murder of Mr. Weasley's daughter and they wanted me to come back here immediately . 
They seem to think that , after all , I'm still the hardest person to do this job . 
They also told me some strange stories . Many also claimed that it was he who threatened to take over their family if they did not agree to suspend my work immediately . 
Mr. Malfoy was already pallid , now more pale , but his juvenile eyes were burning with rage . 
He smirked mockingly : 
- Really ? Did you stop the attack ? have caught the culprit ? 
Dumbledore replied with a smile : 
- We are done . 
Mr. Malfoy's tone was sharp : 
- Star ? 
Who is that ? 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- Same person , same as last time , Mr. Malfoy . 
Only this time , the Dark Lord Voldemort had borrowed the hands of others . 
By this diary . 
Dumbledore raised a small notebook with a big hole in the center . 
He carefully observed Malfoy's reaction . 
But Harry noticed Dobby . 
The elf is making a very monstrous gesture . His huge eyes stared at Harry , indicating that his hand was just behind his diary , and then Malfoy , punching his head with his fist . 
Mr. Malfoy spoke slowly with Dumbledore : 
- I understand 
Dumbledore was still staring at Malfoy's eyes , his voice flat : 
- A wise plan . 
Because if Harry , and his friend Ron , did not find the diary , then Ginny would have gotten all the guilty . 
No one will be able to prove that she acted unconsciously , not just by being mesmerized by others . 
Mr. Malfoy said nothing . 
His face was bare as a mask . 
Dumbledore continues : 
- And imagine , then what can happen ? The Weasley family is one of the best pureblood families in our witchcraft world . 
Imagine what the consequences and consequences would be for Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act , once his own daughter was discovered to have attacked and murdered students born in the family . Muggle Fortunately the diary was discovered , and Tom Riddle's memory was wiped out . 
If not , who knows how bad the consequences will be 
Mr. Malfoy was forced to speak in a stiff voice : 
- Thank you very much ! 
His voice hissed through his teeth . 
Behind him , Dobby kept pointing at his diary , pointing to Malfoy , then punching himself in the head . 
And then Harry realized . 
He nodded to Dobby . 
The elf backed into the corner , nipping at his ear to punish . 
Harry asked , 
- Mr. Malfoy , do you want to know why Ginny got the diary ? 
Mr. Malfoy looked at Harry . 
He responded coldly : 
- How can I know how the stupid little child got that diary ? 
Harry said : 
" You know , because you gave it to Ginny . " 
In Phu Qui bookstore and Co Han . 
He falsified Ginny's Ginny's textbook on disparage , and then ditched the diary , right ? 
Mr. Malfoy's white hands clenched and opened . 
He hissed : 
- Where is the evidence ? 
Dumbledore turned to smile at Harry : 
- Well , no one can prove it . 
Especially now that Tom Riddle has been removed from the book . 
However , I have advised you , Mr. Malfoy : There should be no other items of Dark Lord Voldemort . 
If any of his items fall into the hands of innocent innocent students , then I think Arthur Weasley is sure to trace back to the origin of those items that come from him . 
Mr. Malfoy stood there for a moment . 
Harry saw clearly that his right hand was twisting as if he were very , very , very wishing to pull out his wand . 
But instead of doing so , he turned to his elf : 
- Come on , Dobby ! 
Malfoy twisted the doorknob , opened it , and his nephew crawled under his feet , forcing a kick to the door . 
Dumbledore and Harry could hear the noise of the elf screaming through the corridors . 
Harry stood up for a moment . 
Then a great idea suddenly appeared in his mind . 
He rushed to tell Dumbledore : 
- Teacher , please allow me to bring that diary to Mr. Malfoy . 
Dumbledore replied , 
Of course , Harry . 
But hurry up quickly . 
Do not you remember the party waiting for you ? 
Harry took a snapshot of the diary on the table and dropped it like an arrow out of the office . 
He still heard Dobby's groaning groan , which was ringing in the corners of the corridor . 
Harry hurriedly took off his shoe , took off the dirty socks off his feet , and stuffed the diary into his socks . 
Harry wondered whether the plot was successful . 
She plugs her neck plug into the dark corridor . 
Maybe Harry catches Malfoy and Dobby at the top of the stairs . 
He just stood there , gasped , saying : 
- Mr. Malfoy , I have this sent back to you 
As he spoke , Harry held up the diary of Mr. Malfoy . 
- What ? 
Mr. Malfoy pulled the socks off , threw aside , and furiously looked at the diary to Harry . 
He said sweetly : 
- You're going to come to a painful end , like your parents , Harry Potter . 
Your parents are stupid people who talk to other people just like you . 
But Dobby did not move . 
The dwarf was fond of the old stocking that Harry had said in his hand , watching the stocking as if it were an invaluable treasure in the world . 
- The owner gave Dobby a sock ! 
Dobby dwarfed in amazement . 
- The boss gave Dobby . 
Mr. Malfoy : 
- What ? 
What have you said ? 
Dobby said in a voice that did not believe it was true . 
- Dobby was given a socks ! 
The boss threw it , and Dobby caught it . 
So Dobby Dobby is free ! 
Mr. Malfoy stood dead , staring at the elf - now his ex - husband . 
Then he turned to Harry : 
- You made me lose a servant , boy ! 
But Dobby yelled : 
- You do not touch Harry Potter ! 
A loud bang , Malfoy was thrown backwards , falling down the stairs , flipping three rounds , finally lying in a heap at the foot of the stairs . 
He stood up , his face bruising purple . 
He withdrew the wand . but Dobby raised a long , threatening finger : 
The long finger pointed down Mr. Malfoy , and the dwarf's voice was fierce : 
- He quit right away ! 
You do not have to touch Harry Potter ! 
Go now go ! 
Mr. Malfoy had no choice . 
Throwing Harry and Dobby a last look at him , Malfoy swatted his cloak around him and hurried away . 
The dwarf looked up at Harry , cried out in the shrill , shrill voice of the devil : 
- Harry Potter has liberated Dobby ! 
Moonlight shining through the nearest window reflects the glittering glitter of two dwarf ghosts . 
She shouted again : 
- Harry Potter has liberated Dobby ! 
Harry grinned . 
- At least I must do it for you ! 
But Dobby , promise never to save my life from this day ! 
The extremely ugly brown face of the dwarf suddenly expanded into a great smile filled with teeth . 
When Dobby helped bring Harry's stockings , Harry said , 
- I just want to ask a question , Dobby . You tell me that all these schemes have nothing to do with Caller - do you remember ? Then 
Dobby's eyes widened , as if it was obvious . 
- Sir , it's a clue . 
I showed you a clue . 
You do not understand why , the Dark Lord before changing their name can be called something okay , right ? 
Harry grumbled : 
- Yes . 
Well , let's go now . 
There was a party set up , and my friend , Hermione , was about to wake up 
Dobby swung his arms around Harry's lower half , squeezing him close . 
Dobby choked : 
- Goodbye Harry Potter ! 
Harry Potter than Dobby thought a lot ! 
At Hogwarts School , Harry had been enjoying a lot of partying . 
But there is no party like this party . 
Everyone in the party was wearing pajamas and the party lasted from midnight till dawn . 
Harry could not tell the height of the party at all : when Hermione ran to him and cried out : 
- You broke the sentence ! 
You have already broken the sentence ! 
Or , as Justin rushed over from the side of the Hufflepuff table , squeezing Harry's hand and apologizing forever for the suspicious case ; or when Hagrid suddenly appeared at three - thirty in the morning , cuddling Ron's and Hermione's shoulders , squeezing both of them face down onto the cake ; Then when someone announced that he and Ron had brought home Gryffindor four hundred points , ensure that this year's Cup will be home Gryffindor . 
It is also possible that the peak of the party was when Professor McGonagall stood up and announced that the exams were vacated by the school ( Hermione cried out ; Or when Dumbledore declares that , unfortunately , Professor Lockhart will 
It is impossible to continue to be in charge of the art of anti - dark art , because the professor must go somewhere to find his memory . 
At least the professor supplements the school rings when they hear this . 
Ron took a piece of orange jam , mumbled : 
- Damn it ! 
I just started to enjoy him 
The rest of the semester passes in the overwhelming sunshine of late spring . 
Hogwarts School returned to normal rhythm with a few minor changes . 
The first change was the Black Hawk Art class that had to be abolished . ( Ron comforts Hermione's grief for lack of schooling : But we've also practiced a lot of this . ) 
The second major change was Mr. Malfoy who was removed from the Hogwarts Board of Trustees . 
Draco Malfoy no longer goes around the school as if the school was his own . 
On the other hand , it looks frustrating at the scowls of mourning . 
Meanwhile , little girl Ginny is now completely happy and cheerful . 
Soon after , he boarded the Hogwarts Express for the summer vacation . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred , George , and Ginny had a prescription for the group . 
They utilize the last few hours to get the magic to play for . 
The two of them played a card game , burned to the last firecracker Fred and George . 
Then they practiced rational disarmament by magic . 
This game , Harry played well , than the other boys . 
Coming to the King's Cross , Harry remembered something : 
- Ginny , did you see Percy's secret doing something that he did not tell you ? 
- Ah , is that it ? 
Ginny giggled . 
- Oh , it was Percy , brother . 
Fred let go of the book bag , dropped it on George's head : 
- What ? 
Ginny says : 
- The image of the bride Huynh is the head of the Ravenclaw , Penelope ! 
During the summer of last year , Percy just wrote to her , remember ? 
Until school , two brothers often secretly meet each other . 
Once I was going to meet two brothers who were kissing in an empty classroom . 
Do not you see , Percy's miserable as long as she was petrified . 
Ginny finished worrying . 
- You do not have to tease Percy ! 
Fred radiated as if its birthday was held early : 
- Yes , I did not dare dream of it ! 
George exemplifies with subdued joy : 
- Of course not ! 
The Hogwarts Express slowly slows down , and finally stops . 
Harry draws goose wool and a piece of parchment , turning to Hermione and Ron . 
He told Ron : 
- This is called a phone number . 
He wrote twice , then tore the parchment into two , giving Hermione and Ron , one for each . 
- Last summer , I talked to your dad about using Muggle phones . 
Uncle will know how to spend . 
Remember to call home at your home Dursley . 
I can not stand two months of summer with only Dudley to talk to 
Hermione boarded the ship and entered the crowded crowd with the splintered fence becoming the gateway to the nine - quarter platform . 
Hermione said : 
- Anyway , your aunt will be proud of you , once they know what you have accomplished in the past school year . 
- proud ? 
Harry asked again . 
- Are you crazy ? 
How many of you near death , where can I die ? 
Aunt dare to be mad 
The door to the Muggle world opens , and they all walk past
