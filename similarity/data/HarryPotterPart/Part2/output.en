Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 
Not for the first time , an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four , Privet Drive . 
Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud , hooting noise from his nephew Harry's room . 
" Third time this week ! " he roared across the table . 
" If you can't control that owl , it ' ll have to go ! " Harry tried , yet again , to explain . 
" She's bored , " he said . 
" She's used to flying around outside . 
If I could just let her out at night — " " Do I look stupid ? " 
" I know what ' ll happen if that owl's let out . " 
He exchanged dark looks with his wife , Petunia . 
" I want more bacon . " 
" Dudley gets enough , don't you , son ? " Dudley , who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair , grinned and turned to Harry . 
" Pass the frying pan . " " You ' ve forgotten the magic word , " said Harry irritably . 
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible : Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen ; Mrs . Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth ; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet , veins throbbing in his temples . 
" I meant ' please ' ! " said Harry quickly . 
" I just — " " I WARNED YOU ! 
I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF ! " Harry stared from his purple - faced uncle to his pale aunt , who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet . 
" All right , " said Harry , " all right . . 
Uncle Vernon sat back down , breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small , sharp eyes . 
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays , Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment , because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy . 
As a matter of fact , he was as not normal as it is possible to be . 
Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays , it was nothing to how Harry felt . 
He missed the castle , with its secret passageways and ghosts , his classes ( though perhaps not Snape , the Potions master ) , the mail arriving by owl , eating banquets in the Great Hall , sleeping in his four - poster bed in the tower dormitory , visiting the gamekeeper , Hagrid , in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds , and , especially , Quidditch , the most popular sport in the wizarding world ( six tall goal posts , four flying balls , and fourteen players on broomsticks ) . 
All Harry's spellbooks , his wand , robes , cauldron , and top - ofthe - line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home . 
What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer ? 
The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles ( not a drop of magical blood in their veins ) , 
and as far as they were concerned , having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame . 
Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl , Hedwig , inside her cage , to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world . 
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family . 
Uncle Vernon was large and neckless , with an enormous black mustache ; Aunt Petunia was horse - faced and bony ; Dudley was blond , pink , and porky . 
Harry , on the other hand , was small and skinny , with brilliant green eyes and jet - black hair that was always untidy . 
He wore round glasses , and on his forehead was a thin , lightning - shaped scar . 
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual , even for a wizard . 
This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past , of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys'doorstep eleven years before . 
At the age of one year old , Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time , Lord Voldemort , whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak . 
Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack , but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar , and somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry . 
He had spent ten years with the Dursleys , never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to , believing the Dursleys'story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents . 
And then , exactly a year ago , Hogwarts had written to Harry , and the whole story had come out . 
but now the school year was over , and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer , back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly . 
The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday . 
Of course , his hopes hadn't been high ; they'd never given him a real present , let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely . . . 
At that moment , Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said , " Now , as we all know , today is a very important day . " 
Harry looked up , hardly daring to believe it . 
Harry went back to his toast . 
Of course , he thought bitterly , Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party . 
Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him ( Uncle Vernon's company made drills ) . 
" I think we should run through the schedule one more time , " said Uncle Vernon . 
" We should all be in position at eight o ' clock . 
Petunia , you will be — ? " " In the lounge , " said Aunt Petunia promptly , " waiting to welcome them graciously to our home . " 
" Good , good . 
And Dudley ? " " I ' ll be waiting to open the door . " 
" Excellent , Dudley , " said Uncle Vernon . 
Then he rounded on Harry . 
" Exactly , " said Uncle Vernon nastily . 
" I will lead them into the lounge , introduce you , Petunia , and pour them drinks . 
" And , Dudley , you ' ll say — " " May I take you through to the dining room , Mrs . Mason ? " said Dudley , offering his fat arm to an invisible woman . 
sniffed Aunt Petunia . 
" And you ? " said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry . 
Petunia , any ideas ? " 
" Vernon tells me you ' re a wonderful golfer , Mr. Mason . . . . 
Do tell me where you bought your dress , Mrs . Mason . . . 
Dudley ? " " How about — ' We had to write an essay about our hero at school , Mr. Mason , and I wrote about you . ' " 
This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry . 
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son , while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing . 
" Too right , you will , " said Uncle Vernon forcefully . 
When dinner's over , you take Mrs . Mason back to the lounge for coffee , Petunia , and I ' ll bring the subject around to drills . 
We ' ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow . " 
He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive . 
And you , " he snarled at Harry . 
Harry left through the back door . 
It was a brilliant , sunny day . 
He crossed the lawn , slumped down on the garden bench , and sang under his breath : " Happy birthday to me . . . 
happy birthday to me . . 
He gazed miserably into the hedge . 
He had never felt so lonely . 
Neither of them had written to him all summer , even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay . 
Countless times , Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter , but it wasn't worth the risk . 
Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school . 
Harry hadn't told the 
For the first couple of weeks back , Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him . 
But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday . 
From any witch or wizard ? 
At the very end of last term , Harry had come face - to - face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself . 
Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self , but he was still terrifying , still cunning , still determined to regain power . 
Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time , but it had been a narrow escape , and even now , weeks later , Harry kept waking in the night , drenched in cold sweat , wondering where Voldemort was now , remembering his livid face , his wide , mad eyes — Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench . 
He had been staring absent - mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back . 
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves . 
Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn . 
" I know what day it is , " sang Dudley , waddling toward him . 
" What ? " said Harry , not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been . 
" I know what day it is , " Dudley repeated , coming right up to him . 
" Well done , " said Harry . 
" So you ' ve finally learned the days of the week . " 
" Today's your birthday , " sneered Dudley . 
Haven't you even got friends at that freak place ? " " Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school , " said Harry coolly . 
Dudley hitched up his trousers , which were slipping down his fat bottom . 
" Why ' re you staring at the hedge ? " he said suspiciously . 
" I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire , " said Harry . 
Dudley stumbled backward at once , a look of panic on his fat face . 
" You c - can't — Dad told you you ' re not to do m - magic — he said he ' ll chuck you out of the house — and you haven't got anywhere else to go — you haven't got any friends to take you — " " Jiggery pokery ! " said Harry in a fierce voice . 
He's doing you know what ! " Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun . 
Then she gave him work to do , with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished . 
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream , Harry cleaned the windows , washed the car , mowed the lawn , trimmed the flowerbeds , pruned and watered the roses , and repainted the garden bench . 
Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds , his back aching , sweat running down his face . 
It was half past seven in the evening when at last , exhausted , he heard Aunt Petunia calling him . 
And walk on the newspaper ! " 
Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen . 
On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding : a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets . 
The Masons will be here soon ! " snapped Aunt Petunia , pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table . 
She was already wearing a salmon - pink cocktail dress . 
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper . 
" Upstairs ! 
Hurry ! " 
As he passed the door to the living room , Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets . 
He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs . 
" Remember , boy — one sound — " Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe , slipped inside , closed the door , and turned to collapse on his bed . 
The trouble was , there was already someone sitting on it . 
Harry managed not to shout out , but it was a close thing . 
The little creature on the bed had large , bat - like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls . 
Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning . 
As they stared at each other , Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall . 
" May I take your coats , Mr. and Mrs . Mason ? " 
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long , thin nose touched the carpet . 
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase , with rips for arm - and leg - holes . 
" Er — hello , " said Harry nervously . 
" Harry Potter ! " said the creature in a high - pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs . 
" So long has Dobby wanted to meet you , sir . . . 
Such an honor it is . . . 
" Th - thank you , " said Harry , edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair , next to Hedwig , who was asleep in her large cage . 
He wanted to ask , " What are you ? " but thought it would sound too rude , so instead he said , " Who are you ? " 
" Dobby , sir . 
Just Dobby . 
Dobby the house - elf , " said the creature . 
" Oh — really ? " said Harry . 
The elf hung his head . 
" Not that I'm not pleased to meet you , " said Harry quickly , " but , er , is there any particular reason you ' re here ? " 
" Oh , yes , sir , " said Dobby earnestly . 
" Dobby has come to tell you , sir . . . it is difficult , sir . . . 
Dobby wonders where to begin . . . 
. " " Sit down , " said Harry politely , pointing at the bed . 
" Never . . . 
" I'm sorry , " he whispered , " I didn't mean to offend you or anything — " " Offend Dobby ! " choked the elf . 
At last he managed to control himself , and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration . 
Dobby shook his head . 
Then , without warning , he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window , shouting , " Bad Dobby ! 
Bad Dobby ! " " Don't — what are you doing ? " 
Harry hissed , springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage . 
" Dobby had to punish himself , sir , " said the elf , who had gone slightly cross - eyed . 
" Dobby almost spoke ill of his family , sir . . . 
. " " Your family ? " 
" The wizard family Dobby serves , sir . . . . 
Dobby is a houseelf — bound to serve one house and one family forever . . . 
. " " Do they know you ' re here ? " 
asked Harry curiously . 
Dobby shuddered . 
" Oh , no , sir , no . . . 
Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you , sir . 
Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this . 
If they ever knew , sir — " " But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door ? " " Dobby doubts it , sir . 
Dobby is always having to punish himself for something , sir . 
. " " But why don't you leave ? 
And the family will never set Dobby free . . . 
Dobby will serve the family until he dies , sir . . . 
Harry stared . 
" And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks , " 
he said . 
" This makes the Dursleys sound almost human . 
Can't anyone help you ? 
" Please , " Harry whispered frantically , " please be quiet . 
If the Dursleys hear anything , if they know you ' re here — " " Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . 
Dobby has heard of your greatness , sir , but of your goodness , Dobby never knew . . . 
Harry , who was feeling distinctly hot in the face , said , " Whatever you ' ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish . 
" Harry Potter is humble and modest , " said Dobby reverently , his orb - like eyes aglow . 
" Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — " " Voldemort ? " said Harry . 
" I know lots of people don't like it . 
My friend Ron — " He stopped again . 
Dobby leaned toward Harry , his eyes wide as headlights . 
" Dobby heard tell , " he said hoarsely , " that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time , just weeks ago . . . 
that Harry Potter escaped yet again . " 
Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears . 
" Ah , sir , " he gasped , dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing . 
" Harry Potter is valiant and bold ! 
He has braved so many dangers already ! 
But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter , to warn him , even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later . . . . 
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts . " 
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice . 
" W - what ? " 
Harry stammered . 
" But I ' ve got to go back — term starts on September first . 
It's all that's keeping me going . 
I don't belong here . 
I belong in your world — at Hogwarts . " 
" No , no , no , " squeaked Dobby , shaking his head so hard his ears flapped . 
" Harry Potter must stay where he is safe . 
He is too great , too good , to lose . 
If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts , he will be in mortal danger . " 
" Why ? " said Harry in surprise . 
" There is a plot , Harry Potter . 
" Dobby has known it for months , sir . 
Harry Potter must not put himself in peril . 
He is too important , sir ! " " What terrible things ? " said Harry at once . 
" Who's plotting them ? " 
" All right ! " cried Harry , grabbing the elf's arm to stop him . 
" You can't tell me . 
I understand . 
But why are you warning me ? " 
You could just shake or nod , " he added hastily as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again . 
Slowly , Dobby shook his head . 
" Not — not He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named , sir — " But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint . 
Harry , however , was completely lost . 
" He hasn't got a brother , has he ? " Dobby shook his head , his eyes wider than ever . 
" Well then , I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts , " said Harry . 
" I mean , there's Dumbledore , for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is , don't you ? " Dobby bowed his head . 
" Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had . 
Dobby knows it , sir . 
And before Harry could stop him , Dobby bounded off the bed , seized Harry's desk lamp , and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps . 
Two seconds later Harry , heart thudding madly , heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall , calling , " Dudley must have left his television on again , the little tyke ! " " Quick ! 
In the closet ! " hissed Harry , stuffing Dobby in , shutting the door , and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned . 
" What — the — devil — are — you — doing ? " said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth , his face horribly close to Harry's . 
One more sound and you ' ll wish you'd never been born , boy ! " 
He stomped flat - footed from the room . 
Shaking , Harry let Dobby out of the closet . 
" See why I ' ve got to go back to Hogwarts ? 
It's the only place I ' ve got — well , I think I ' ve got friends . " 
" Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter ? " said Dobby slyly . 
" How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me ? " Dobby shuffled his feet . 
" Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby . 
" Dobby has them here , sir , " said the elf . 
Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach , he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing . 
Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing , Ron's untidy scrawl , and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper , Hagrid . 
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry . 
" Harry Potter mustn't be angry . . . . 
Dobby hoped . . . 
if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . 
Harry Potter might not want to go back to school , sir . . . 
Harry wasn't listening . 
He made a grab for the letters , but Dobby jumped out of reach . 
" Harry Potter will have them , sir , if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts . 
Ah , sir , this is a danger you must not face ! 
Say you won't go back , sir ! " " No , " said Harry angrily . 
Before Harry could move , Dobby had darted to the bedroom door , pulled it open , and sprinted down the stairs . 
Mouth dry , stomach lurching , Harry sprang after him , trying not to make a sound . 
He jumped the last six steps , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby . 
From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying , " . . . 
tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers , Mr. Mason . 
Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear . 
Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding , the mountain of cream and sugared violets , was floating up near the ceiling . 
On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby . 
" No , " croaked Harry . 
" Please . . . 
. " " Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school — " " Dobby . . . 
please . . 
. " " Say it , sir — " " I can't — " Dobby gave him a tragic look . 
" Then Dobby must do it , sir , for Harry Potter's own good . " 
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart - stopping crash . 
Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered . 
With a crack like a whip , Dobby vanished . 
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry , rigid with shock , covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia's pudding . 
He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room , promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left , and handed him a mop . 
Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry , still shaking , started scrubbing the kitchen clean . 
Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after - dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window , dropped a letter on Mrs . Mason's head , and swooped out again . 
Mrs . Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics . 
Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes , and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke . 
Harry stood in the kitchen , clutching the mop for support , as Uncle Vernon advanced on him , a demonic glint in his tiny eyes . 
" Read it ! " he hissed evilly , brandishing the letter the owl had delivered . 
" Go on — read it ! " 
Harry took it . 
Dear Mr. Potter , We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine . 
As you know , underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school , and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school ( Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery , 1875 , Paragraph C ) . 
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non - magical community ( Muggles ) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks ' Statute of Secrecy . 
Mafalda Hopkirk improper use of magic office Ministry of Magic 
Harry looked up from the letter and gulped . 
" Forgot to mention it . . . . 
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog , all his teeth bared . 
I'm locking you up . . . . 
You ' re never going back to that school . . . 
never . . . 
and if you try and magic yourself out — they ' ll expel you ! " 
And laughing like a maniac , he dragged Harry back upstairs . 
Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word . 
The following morning , he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window . 
He himself fitted a cat - flap in the bedroom door , so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day . 
They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening . 
Otherwise , he was locked in his room around the clock . 
Three days later , the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting , and Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation . 
He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him . 
Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats , he had lost his only weapon . 
Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts , but the way things were going , he'd probably starve to death anyway . 
The cat - flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared , pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room . 
Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray . 
She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust . 
He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat - flap and lay back down on the bed , somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup . 
Exhausted , stomach rumbling , mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions , Harry fell into an uneasy sleep . 
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo , with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage . 
He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out , asking for help , but Dobby called , " Harry Potter is safe there , sir ! " and vanished . 
Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage , laughing at him . 
" Stop it , " Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head . 
I'm trying to sleep . . . 
He opened his eyes . 
Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window . 
And someone was goggling through the bars at him : a freckle - faced , red - haired , long - nosed someone . 
Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window . 
" Ron ! " breathed Harry , creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars . 
" Ron , how did you — What the — ? " 
Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car , which was parked in midair . 
Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George , Ron's elder twin brothers . 
" All right , Harry ? " asked George . 
" What's been going on ? " said Ron . " Why haven't you been answering my letters ? 
" He works for the Ministry , " said Ron . " You know we ' re not supposed to do spells outside school — " 
" You should talk , " said Harry , staring at the floating car . 
It's Dad's , we didn't enchant it . 
But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — " " I told you , I didn't — but it ' ll take too long to explain now — look , can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back , and obviously I can't magic myself out , because the Ministry ' ll think that's the second spell I ' ve done in three days , so — " " Stop gibbering , " said Ron . " We ' ve come to take you home with us . " " But you can't magic me out either — " " We don't need to , " said Ron , jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning . 
" If the Dursleys wake up , I'm dead , " said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car . 
" Don't worry , " said Fred , " and stand back . " 
The car revved louder and louder and suddenly , with a crunching noise , the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air . 
Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground . 
Panting , Ron hoisted them up into the car . 
Harry listened anxiously , but there was no sound from the Dursleys ' bedroom . 
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron , Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry's window . 
" Get in , " Ron said . 
" But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick — " " Where is it ? " 
" Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I can't get out of this room — " " No problem , " said George from the front passenger seat . 
" Out of the way , Harry . " 
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry's room . 
You had to hand it to them , thought Harry , as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock . 
There was a small click and the door swung open . 
" Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks , " Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing . 
Harry dashed around his room , collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron . 
Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs . 
Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough . 
At last , panting , they reached the landing , then carried the trunk through Harry's room to the open window . 
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron , and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side . 
Inch by inch , the trunk slid through the window . 
Uncle Vernon coughed again . 
" One good push — " Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car . 
" Okay , let's go , " George whispered . 
But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him , followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon's voice . 
Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on — he snatched up Hedwig's cage , dashed to the window , and passed it out to Ron . 
He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door — and it crashed open . 
For a split second , Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway ; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry , grabbing him by the ankle . 
Ron , Fred , and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard as they could . 
" Petunia ! " 
roared Uncle Vernon . 
" He's getting away ! 
But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon's grasp — Harry was in the car — he'd slammed the door shut — " Put your foot down , Fred ! " yelled Ron , and the car shot suddenly toward the moon . 
Harry couldn't believe it — he was free . 
He rolled down the window , the night air whipping his hair , and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were all hanging , dumbstruck , out of Harry's window . 
" See you next summer ! " 
Harry yelled . 
The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat , grinning from ear to ear . 
" Let Hedwig out , " he told Ron . " She can fly behind us . 
George handed the hairpin to Ron and , a moment later , Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost . 
" So — what's the story , Harry ? " said Ron impatiently . 
" What's been happening ? " 
Harry told them all about Dobby , the warning he'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding . 
" Very fishy , " said Fred finally . 
" I don't think he could , " said Harry . 
" I told you , every time he got close to letting something slip , he started banging his head against the wall . " 
He saw Fred and George look at each other . 
" What , you think he was lying to me ? " said Harry . 
I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com - 
ing back to Hogwarts . 
" Draco Malfoy , " Harry explained . 
" He hates me . " " Draco Malfoy ? " said George , turning around . 
" Not Lucius Malfoy's son ? " " Must be , it's not a very common name , is it ? " said Harry . 
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before , and they didn't surprise him at all . 
Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind , thoughtful , and sensitive boy . 
. " said Harry . 
" But all we ' ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden . 
Harry was silent . 
Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything , his family was rolling in wizard gold ; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house . 
Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do . 
" I'm glad we came to get you , anyway , " said Ron . " I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters . 
I thought it was Errol's fault at first — " " Who's Errol ? " " Our owl . 
He's ancient . 
" And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room . . . . 
Fred twiddled the steering wheel . 
" So , does your dad know you ' ve got the car ? " said Harry , guessing the answer . 
" Er , no , " said Ron , " he had to work tonight . 
Hopefully we ' ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it . " 
" What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic , anyway ? " " He works in the most boring department , " said Ron . " The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office . " 
Like , last year , some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop . 
It was a nightmare — Dad was working overtime for weeks . " 
" What happened ? " 
" The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose . 
He takes it apart , puts spells on it , and puts it back together again . 
If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest . 
It drives Mum mad . " " That's the main road , " said George , peering down through the windshield . 
A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east . 
Fred brought the car lower , and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees . 
" Ottery St . Catchpole . " 
Lower and lower went the flying car . 
The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees . 
" Touchdown ! " said Fred as , with a slight bump , they hit the ground . 
They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard , and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house . 
It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen , but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic ( which , Harry reminded himself , it probably was ) . 
Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof . 
A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read , the burrow . 
Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron . 
" It's not much , " said Ron . " It's wonderful , " said Harry happily , thinking of Privet Drive . 
They got out of the car . 
Then , Ron , you come bounding downstairs going , ' Mum , look who turned up in the night ! ' and she ' ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car . " 
" Right , " said Ron . " Come on , Harry , I sleep at the — at the top — " Ron had gone a nasty greenish color , his eyes fixed on the house . 
The other three wheeled around . 
Mrs . Weasley was marching across the yard , scattering chickens , and for a short , plump , kind - faced woman , it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber - toothed tiger . 
" Ah , " said Fred . 
" Oh , dear , " said George . 
Mrs . Weasley came to a halt in front of them , her hands on her hips , staring from one guilty face to the next . 
She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket . 
" So , " she said . 
" ' Morning , Mum , " said George , in what he clearly thought was a jaunty , winning voice . 
" Have you any idea how worried I ' ve been ? " said Mrs . Weasley in a deadly whisper . 
" Sorry , Mum , but see , we had to — " All three of Mrs . Weasley's sons were taller than she was , but they cowered as her rage broke over them . 
" Beds empty ! 
No note ! 
" YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY ' S BOOK ! " yelled Mrs . Weasley , prodding a finger in Fred's chest . 
" I'm very pleased to see you , Harry , dear , " she said . 
" Come in and have some breakfast . " 
She turned and walked back into the house and Harry , after a nervous glance at Ron , who nodded encouragingly , followed her . 
The kitchen was small and rather cramped . 
There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle , and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat , looking around . 
He had never been in a wizard house before . 
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all . 
And unless Harry's ears were deceiving him , the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was " Witching Hour , with the popular singing sorceress , Celestina Warbeck . " 
" I don't blame you , dear , " she assured Harry , tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate . 
" Arthur and I have been worried about you , too . 
But really " ( she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate ) , " flying an illegal car halfway across the country — anyone could have seen you — " She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink , which began to clean themselves , clinking gently in the background . 
Mrs . Weasley snapped . 
" They were starving him , Mum ! " said George . 
" And you ! " said Mrs . Weasley , but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him . 
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small , redheaded figure in a long nightdress , who appeared in the kitchen , gave a small squeal , and ran out again . 
" Ginny , " said Ron in an undertone to Harry . 
She's been talking about you all summer . " 
" Yeah , she ' ll be wanting your autograph , Harry , " Fred said with a grin , but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word . 
Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean , which took a surprisingly short time . 
" Blimey , I'm tired , " yawned Fred , setting down his knife and fork at last . 
" I think I ' ll go to bed and — " " You will not , " snapped Mrs . Weasley . 
" It's your own fault you ' ve been up all night . 
" You can go up to bed , dear , " she added to Harry . 
I ' ve never seen a de - gnoming — " " That's very sweet of you , dear , but it's dull work , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Now , let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject — " And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece . 
George groaned . 
" Mum , we know how to de - gnome a garden — " 
Harry looked at the cover of Mrs . Weasley's book . 
There was a big photograph on the front of a very good - looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes . 
As always in the wizarding world , the photograph was moving ; the wizard , who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart , kept winking cheekily up at them all . 
Mrs . Weasley beamed down at him . 
" Don't be so ridiculous , Fred , " said Mrs . Weasley , her cheeks rather pink . 
" All right , if you think you know better than Lockhart , you can go and get on with it , and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it . " 
The garden was large , and in Harry's eyes , exactly what a garden should be . 
The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it — there were plenty of weeds , and the grass needed cutting — but there were gnarled trees all around the walls , plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed , and a big green pond full of frogs . 
" Gerroff me ! 
It was small and leathery looking , with a large , knobby , bald head exactly like a potato . 
Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet ; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down . 
" This is what you have to do , " he said . 
Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face , Ron added , " It doesn't hurt them — you ' ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes . " 
He let go of the gnome's ankles : It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge . 
" Pitiful , " said Fred . " I bet I can get mine beyond that stump . " 
He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge , but the gnome , sensing weakness , sank its razor - sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until — " Wow , Harry — that must ' ve been fifty feet . . . 
" The moment they know the de - gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look . 
Soon , the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line , their little shoulders hunched . 
" They ' ll be back , " said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field . 
" They love it here . . . . 
Just then , the front door slammed . 
" He's back ! " said George . 
They hurried through the garden and back into the house . 
Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed . 
He was a thin man , going bald , but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's . 
" Nine raids . 
Nine ! 
And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned . . . 
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed . 
" Find anything , Dad ? " said Fred eagerly . 
" All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle , " yawned Mr. Weasley . 
" Just Muggle - baiting , " sighed Mr. Weasley . 
" Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it . . . . 
Of course , it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking — they ' ll insist they just keep losing it . 
Mrs . Weasley had appeared , holding a long poker like a sword . 
Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open . 
He stared guiltily at his wife . 
" C - cars , Molly , dear ? " " Yes , Arthur , cars , " said Mrs . Weasley , her eyes flashing . 
" Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked , while really he was enchanting it to make it fly . " 
Mr. Weasley blinked . 
" Well , dear , I think you ' ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that , even if — er — he maybe would have done better to , um , tell his wife the truth . . . . 
There's a loophole in the law , you ' ll find . . . . 
As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car , the fact that the car could fly wouldn't — " " Arthur Weasley , you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law ! " shouted Mrs . Weasley . 
And for your information , Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly ! " " Harry ? " said Mr. Weasley blankly . 
" Harry who ? " 
He looked around , saw Harry , and jumped . 
" Good lord , is it Harry Potter ? Very pleased to meet you , Ron's told us so much about — " " Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night ! " 
shouted Mrs . Weasley . 
" What have you got to say about that , eh ? " " Did you really ? " said Mr. Weasley eagerly . 
. " " Let's leave them to it , " Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs . Weasley swelled like a bullfrog . 
" Come on , I ' ll show you my bedroom . " 
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase , which wound its way , zigzagging up through the house . 
On the third landing , a door stood ajar . 
Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap . 
She never shuts up normally — " They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it , saying ronald's room . 
Harry stepped in , his head almost touching the sloping ceiling , and blinked . 
It was like walking into a furnace : Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange : the bedspread , the walls , even the ceiling . 
Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards , all wearing bright orange robes , carrying broomsticks , and waving energetically . 
" Your Quidditch team ? " said Harry . 
" The Chudley Cannons , " said Ron , pointing at the orange bedspread , which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball . 
" Ninth in the league . " 
Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner , next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs , the Mad Muggle . 
Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill , next to his fat gray rat , Scabbers , who was snoozing in a patch of sun . 
Harry stepped over a pack of Self - Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window . 
In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys ' hedge . 
Then he turned to look at Ron , who was watching him almost nervously , as though waiting for his opinion . 
" It's a bit small , " said Ron quickly . 
And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic ; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning . . . 
But Harry , grinning widely , said , " This is the best house I ' ve ever been in . " 
Ron's ears went pink . 
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered ; the Weasleys ' house burst with the strange and unexpected . 
Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted , " Tuck your shirt in , scruffy ! " 
The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet , and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal . 
What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's , however , wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul : It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him . 
Mrs . Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal . 
Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles , asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked . 
" Ingenious , really , how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic . " 
Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow . 
He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs . Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table . 
She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun . 
" Letters from school , " said Mr. Weasley , passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment , addressed in green ink . 
You two ' ve got them , too , " he added , as Fred and George ambled in , still in their pajamas . 
Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first . 
There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year . 
Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart 
" You ' ve been told to get all Lockhart's books , too ! " he said . 
" That lot won't come cheap , " said George , with a quick look at his parents . 
. " " Well , we ' ll manage , " said Mrs . Weasley , but she looked worried . 
" Oh , are you starting at Hogwarts this year ? " 
Harry asked Ginny . 
She nodded , blushing to the roots of her flaming hair , and put her elbow in the butter dish . 
Fortunately no one saw this except Harry , because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in . 
" Morning , all , " said Percy briskly . 
He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately , pulling from underneath him a molting , gray feather duster — at least , that was what Harry thought it was , until he saw that it was breathing . 
" Errol ! " said Ron , taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing . 
" Finally — he's got Hermione's answer . 
I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys . " 
He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it , but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining board instead , muttering , " Pathetic . " 
Then he ripped open Hermione's letter and read it out loud : " ' Dear Ron , and Harry if you ' re there , " ' I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too . 
I ' ve been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl , because I think another delivery might finish your one off . 
— ' and we ' re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books . 
" ' Let me know what's happening as soon as you can . 
" What ' re you all up to today ? " Harry , Ron , Fred , and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned . 
It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below , meaning that they could practice Quidditch there , as long as they didn't fly too high . 
They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand , which was easily the best broom ; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies . 
Five minutes later they were marching up the hill , broomsticks over their shoulders . 
They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them , but he had said he was busy . 
Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far ; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time . 
" He's not himself . 
I don't think I could stand the shame . " 
Bill was the oldest Weasley brother . 
Harry had never met either of them , but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank , Gringotts . 
" Five sets of Lockhart books ! 
And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything . . . 
Harry said nothing . 
Of course , it was only in the wizarding world that he had money ; you couldn't use Galleons , Sickles , and Knuts in Muggle shops . 
He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys ; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold . 
Mrs . Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday . 
After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each , they pulled on their coats and Mrs . Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside . 
Ah well , guests first ! 
After you , Harry dear ! " 
Harry stared at them all watching him . 
" W - what am I supposed to do ? " he stammered . 
" He's never traveled by Floo powder , " said Ron suddenly . 
" Sorry , Harry , I forgot . " 
" Never ? " said Mr. Weasley . 
" But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year ? " 
" I went on the Underground — " " Really ? " said Mr. Weasley eagerly . 
How exactly — " " Not now , Arthur , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot , stepped up to the fire , and threw the powder into the flames . 
" Well , there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from , you know , but as long as you ' ve spoken clearly — " " He ' ll be fine , Molly , don't fuss , " said Mr. Weasley , helping himself to Floo powder , too . 
" Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney , don't worry about that — " " Well . . . 
all right . . . 
you go after Arthur , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Now , when you get into the fire , say where you ' re going — " " And keep your elbows tucked in , " Ron advised . 
" And your eyes shut , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" The soot — " " Don't fidget , " said Ron . " Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace — " " But don't panic and get out too early ; wait until you see Fred and George . " 
Trying hard to bear all this in mind , Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire . 
He took a deep breath , scattered the powder into the flames , and stepped forward ; the fire felt like a warm breeze ; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash . 
It felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain . 
He seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick — something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly , still spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop , and then — He fell , face forward , onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap . 
Dizzy and bruised , covered in soot , he got gingerly to his feet , holding his broken glasses up to his eyes . 
He was quite alone , but where he was , he had no idea . 
All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large , dimly lit wizard's shop — but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list . 
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion , a bloodstained pack of cards , and a staring glass eye . 
Evil - looking masks stared down from the walls , an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter , and rusty , spiked instruments hung from the ceiling . 
Even worse , the dark , narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley . 
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth , Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door , but before he'd got halfway toward it , two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost , covered in soot , and wearing broken glasses : Draco Malfoy . 
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left ; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed , leaving a small crack to peer through . 
Seconds later , a bell clanged , and Malfoy stepped into the shop . 
Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop , looking lazily at the items on display , and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying , " Touch nothing , Draco . " 
Malfoy , who had reached for the glass eye , said , " I thought you were going to buy me a present . " 
" Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year . 
He's not even that good , it's just because he's famous . . . 
everyone thinks he's so smart , wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick — " " You have told me this at least a dozen times already , " said Mr. Malfoy , with a quelling look at his son . 
" And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Potter , not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear — ah , Mr. Borgin . " 
A stooping man had appeared behind the counter , smoothing his greasy hair back from his face . 
" Mr. 
Malfoy , what a pleasure to see you again , " said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair . 
I must show you , just in today , and very reasonably priced — " " I'm not buying today , Mr. Borgin , but selling , " said Mr. Malfoy . 
The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face . 
" You have heard , of course , that the Ministry is conducting more raids , " said Mr. Malfoy , taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read . 
" I have a few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me , if the Ministry were to call . . . 
Mr. Malfoy's lip curled . 
" I have not been visited yet . 
" — and as you see , certain of these poisons might make it appear — " " I understand , sir , of course , " said Mr. Borgin . 
" Let me see . . 
. " " Can I have that ? " 
interrupted Draco , pointing at the withered hand on its cushion . 
" Ah , the Hand of Glory ! " said Mr. Borgin , abandoning Mr. Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco . 
" Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder ! 
Your son has fine taste , sir . " " I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer , Borgin , " said Mr. Malfoy coldly , and Mr. Borgin said quickly , " No offense , sir , no offense meant — " " Though if his grades don't pick up , " said Mr. Malfoy , more coldly still , " that may indeed be all he is fit for — " " It's not my fault , " retorted Draco . 
" The teachers all have favorites , that Hermione Granger — " " I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam , " snapped Mr. Malfoy . 
" It's the same all over , " said Mr. Borgin , in his oily voice . 
" In that case , perhaps we can return to my list , " said Mr. Malfoy shortly . 
Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read , smirking , the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals , Caution : Do Not Touch . 
Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him . 
He walked forward — he stretched out his hand for the handle — " Done , " said Mr. Malfoy at the counter . 
" Come , Draco — " Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away . 
" Good day to you , Mr. Borgin . 
I ' ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods . " 
Harry waited for a minute in case he came back , then , quietly as he could , slipped out of the cabinet , past the glass cases , and out of the shop door . 
Clutching his broken glasses to his face , Harry stared around . 
He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts . 
The one he'd just left , Borgin and Burkes , looked like the largest , but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and , two doors down , a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders . 
Feeling jumpy , Harry set off , trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here . 
This didn't help , as Harry had never heard of such a place . 
Trying to stay calm , he wondered what to do . 
An aged witch stood in front of him , holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails . 
Harry backed away . 
" I'm fine , thanks , " he said . 
" I'm just — " " HARRY ! 
Harry's heart leapt . 
" Hagrid ! " 
Harry croaked in relief . 
" I was lost — Floo powder — " Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch , knocking the tray right out of her hands . 
Harry saw a familiar , snow - white marble building in the distance — Gringotts Bank . 
" Yer a mess ! " said Hagrid gruffly , brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary . 
" I told you , I was lost — what were you doing down there , anyway ? " 
Yer not on yer own ? " " I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated , " Harry explained . 
" I ' ve got to go and find them . . . 
They set off together down the street . 
Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys . 
" Lousy Muggles , " growled Hagrid . 
Harry ! 
Over here ! " 
Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts . 
She ran down to meet them , her bushy brown hair flying behind her . 
" What happened to your glasses ? 
Hello , Hagrid — Oh , it's wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming into Gringotts , Harry ? " " As soon as I ' ve found the Weasleys , " said Harry . 
Harry and Hermione looked around : Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron , Fred , George , Percy , and Mr. Weasley . 
" Harry , " Mr. Weasley panted . 
" Knockturn Alley , " said Hagrid grimly . 
" Excellent ! " said Fred and George together . 
" We ' ve never been allowed in , " said Ron enviously . 
" I should ruddy well think not , " growled Hagrid . 
Mrs . Weasley now came galloping into view , her handbag swinging wildly in one hand , Ginny just clinging onto the other . 
" Oh , Harry — oh , my dear — you could have been anywhere — " Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away . 
Mr. Weasley took Harry's glasses , gave them a tap of his wand , and returned them , good as new . 
" See yer at Hogwarts ! " 
" Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes ? " 
Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps . 
" Malfoy and his father . " 
" Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything ? " said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them . 
" No , he was selling — " " So he's worried , " said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction . 
" Oh , I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something . . . 
. " " You be careful , Arthur , " said Mrs . Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door . 
" That family's trouble . 
" But you ' re Muggles ! " said Mr. Weasley delightedly . 
" We must have a drink ! 
Molly , look ! " 
" Meet you back here , " Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin . 
Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys ' vault , but felt dreadful , far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley , when it was opened . 
There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside , and just one gold Galleon . 
Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts , Lee Jordan . 
Mrs . Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop . 
Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione strolled off along the winding , cobbled street . 
" A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , " Ron read aloud off the back cover . 
. " " Go away , " Percy snapped . 
" ' Course , he's very ambitious , Percy , he's got it all planned out . . . . 
He wants to be Minister of Magic . . 
Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it . 
An hour later , they headed for Flourish and Blotts . 
They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop . 
As they approached it , they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors , trying to get in . 
The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows : 
" We can actually meet him ! " 
Hermione squealed . 
The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs . Weasley's age . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione squeezed inside . 
A long line wound right to the back of the shop , where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books . 
They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs . Granger . 
" Oh , there you are , good , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view , seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face , all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd . 
" This is for the Daily Prophet — " " Big deal , " said Ron , rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it . 
Gilderoy Lockhart heard him . 
He looked up . 
He saw Ron — and then he saw Harry . 
He stared . 
The crowd parted , whispering excitedly ; Lockhart dived forward , seized Harry's arm , and pulled him to the front . 
Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer , who was clicking away madly , wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys . 
" Nice big smile , Harry , " said Lockhart , through his own gleaming teeth . 
When he finally let go of Harry's hand , Harry could hardly feel his fingers . 
He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys , but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side . 
" Ladies and gentlemen , " he said loudly , waving for quiet . 
" What an extraordinary moment this is ! 
The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I ' ve been sitting on for some time ! 
" When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today , he only wanted to buy my autobiography — which I shall be happy to present him now , free of charge — " The crowd applauded again . 
" He had no idea , " Lockhart continued , giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose , " that he would shortly be getting much , much more than my book , Magical Me . 
He and his schoolmates will , in fact , be getting the real magical me . 
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September , I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ! " 
The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Staggering slightly under their weight , he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room , where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron . 
" You have these , " Harry mumbled to her , tipping the books into the cauldron . 
He straightened up and found himself face - to - face with Draco Malfoy , who was wearing his usual sneer . 
" Famous Harry Potter , " said Malfoy . 
It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry . 
She was glaring at Malfoy . 
" Potter , you ' ve got yourself a girlfriend ! " drawled Malfoy . 
Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over , both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books . 
" Oh , it's you , " said Ron , looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe . 
" Bet you ' re surprised to see Harry here , eh ? " " Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop , Weasley , " retorted Malfoy . 
" I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those . " 
Ron went as red as Ginny . 
He dropped his books into the cauldron , too , and started toward Malfoy , but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket . 
" Ron ! " said Mr. Weasley , struggling over with Fred and George . 
" What are you doing ? 
It's too crowded in here , let's go outside . " 
" Well , well , well — Arthur Weasley . " 
It was Mr. Malfoy . 
" Lucius , " said Mr. Weasley , nodding coldly . 
" Busy time at the Ministry , I hear , " said Mr. Malfoy . 
I hope they ' re paying you overtime ? " 
He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted , from amid the glossy Lockhart books , a very old , very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration . 
" Obviously not , " Mr. Malfoy said . 
" Dear me , what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it ? " 
Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny . 
" Clearly , " said Mr. Malfoy , his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs . Granger , who were watching apprehensively . 
and I thought your family could sink no lower — " There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying ; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy , knocking him backward into a bookshelf . 
In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart . 
Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools . 
He was still holding Ginny's old Transfiguration book . 
He thrust it at her , his eyes glittering with malice . 
" Here , girl — take your book — it's the best your father can give you — " Pulling himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop . 
" Yeh should ' ve ignored him , Arthur , " said Hagrid , almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes . 
" Rotten ter the core , the whole family , everyone knows that — no Malfoy's worth listenin'ter — bad blood , that's what it is — come on now — let's get outta here . " 
The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving , but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it . 
They hurried up the street , the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs . Weasley beside herself with fury . 
He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report — said it was all publicity — " But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron , where Harry , the Weasleys , and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder . 
They said good - bye to the Grangers , who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side ; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked , but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs . Weasley's face . 
Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder . 
It definitely wasn't his favorite way to travel . 
He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts , but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life . 
It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive . 
On their last evening , Mrs . Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things , ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding . 
Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks ; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour . 
Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed . 
It took a long while to get started next morning . 
Mrs . Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills ; people kept colliding on the stairs , half - dressed with bits of toast in their hands ; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck , tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car . 
Harry couldn't see how eight people , six large trunks , two owls , and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia . 
He had reckoned , of course , without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added . 
" Not a word to Molly , " he whispered to Harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily . 
When at last they were all in the car , Mrs . Weasley glanced into the back seat , where Harry , Ron , Fred , George , and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side , and said , " Muggles do know more than we give them credit for , don't they ? " 
Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard , Harry turning back for a last look at the house . 
By the time she had clambered back into the car , they were running very late , and tempers were running high . 
Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife . 
Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station . 
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year . 
" Percy first , " said Mrs . Weasley , looking nervously at the clock overhead , which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier . 
Percy strode briskly forward and vanished . 
Mr. Weasley went next ; Fred and George followed . 
" I ' ll take Ginny and you two come right after us , " Mrs . Weasley told Harry and Ron , grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off . 
In the blink of an eye they were gone . 
" Let's go together , we ' ve only got a minute , " Ron said to Harry . 
Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier . 
He felt perfectly confident ; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder . 
Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier , gathering speed . 
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump , Harry was knocked off his feet , and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor , and she rolled away , shrieking indignantly ; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled , " What in blazes d ' you think you ' re doing ? " " Lost control of the trolley , " Harry gasped , clutching his ribs as he got up . 
Ron ran to pick up Hedwig , who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd . 
" Why can't we get through ? " 
Harry hissed to Ron . " I dunno — " Ron looked wildly around . 
" We're going to miss the train , " Ron whispered . 
" I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself — " Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach . 
Ten seconds . . . 
nine seconds . . . 
He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might . 
Three seconds . . . 
two seconds . . . 
" It's gone , " said Ron , sounding stunned . 
" The train's left . 
Harry gave a hollow laugh . 
" The Dursleys haven't given me pocket money for about six years . " 
Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier . 
" What ' re we going to do ? 
I don't know how long it ' ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us . " 
They looked around . 
" The car ! " " What about it ? " 
" We can fly the car to Hogwarts ! " " But I thought — " " We're stuck , right ? 
And we ' ve got to get to school , haven't we ? 
And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's a real emergency , section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy — " " But your mum and dad . . 
. " said Harry , pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way . 
" They don't need the car ! " said Ron impatiently . 
You know , just vanish and reappear at home ! 
" Can you fly it ? " 
" C ' mon , let's go . 
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles , out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked . 
They heaved their luggage back in , put Hedwig on the back seat , and got into the front . 
Harry stuck his head out of the window : Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead , but their street was empty . 
" Okay , " he said . 
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard . 
Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him , hear the engine , feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose , but for all he could see , he had become a pair of eyeballs , floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars . 
" Let's go , " said Ron's voice from his right . 
And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away , dropping out of sight as the car rose ; in seconds , the whole of London lay , smoky and glittering , below them . 
Then there was a popping noise and the car , Harry , and Ron reappeared . 
" Uh - oh , " said Ron , jabbing at the Invisibility Booster . 
" It's faulty — " Both of them pummeled it . 
The car vanished . 
Then it flickered back again . 
" Hold on ! " 
ator ; they shot straight into the low , woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy . 
" We need to see the train to know what direction to go in , " said Ron . " Dip back down again — quickly — " They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats , squinting at the ground . 
" I can see it ! " 
Harry yelled . 
" Right ahead — there ! " 
" Due north , " said Ron , checking the compass on the dashboard . 
" Okay , we ' ll just have to check on it every half hour or so — hold on — " And they shot up through the clouds . 
A minute later , they burst out into a blaze of sunlight . 
It was a different world . 
The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud , the sky a bright , endless blue under the blinding white sun . 
They looked at each other and started to laugh ; for a long time , they couldn't stop . 
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream . 
This , thought Harry , was surely the only way to travel — past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud , in a car full of hot , bright sunlight , with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment , and the prospect of seeing Fred's and George's jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle . 
They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north , each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view . 
The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink . 
He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters , but Harry's T - shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose . 
It was still right below them , winding its way past a snowcapped mountain . 
Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again , but as he did so , the engine began to whine . 
Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances . 
" It's probably just tired , " said Ron . " It's never been this far before . . . 
And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker . 
Stars were blossoming in the blackness . 
Harry pulled his sweater back on , trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly , as though in protest . 
" Not far , " said Ron , more to the car than to Harry , " not far now , " and he patted the dashboard nervously . 
When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later , they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew . 
" There ! " 
Harry shouted , making Ron and Hedwig jump . 
Silhouetted on the dark horizon , high on the cliff over the lake , stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle . 
" Come on , " Ron said cajolingly , giving the steering wheel a little shake , " nearly there , come on — " The engine groaned . 
Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood . 
Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake . 
The car gave a nasty wobble . 
Glancing out of his window , Harry saw the smooth , black , glassy surface of the water , a mile below . 
Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel . 
The car wobbled again . 
" Come on , " Ron muttered . 
They were over the lake — the castle was right ahead — Ron put his foot down . 
There was a loud clunk , a splutter , and the engine died completely . 
" Uh - oh , " said Ron , into the silence . 
The nose of the car dropped . 
Ron yelled , swinging the steering wheel around ; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc , soaring over the dark greenhouses , then the vegetable patch , and then out over the black lawns , losing altitude all the time . 
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket — " STOP ! 
STOP ! " he yelled , whacking the dashboard and the windshield , but they were still plummeting , the ground flying up toward them — " WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE ! " Harry bellowed , lunging for the steering wheel , but too late — CRUNCH . 
With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood , they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt . 
Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood ; Hedwig was shrieking in terror ; a golf - ball - sized lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he had hit the windshield ; and to his right , Ron let out a low , despairing groan . 
" Are you okay ? " 
Harry said urgently . 
" My wand , " said Ron , in a shaky voice . 
Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it up at the school , but he never even got started . 
At that very moment , something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull , sending him lurching sideways into Ron , just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof . 
" What's happen — ? " 
Ron gasped , staring through the windshield , and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it . 
Its trunk was bent almost double , and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach . 
" Aaargh ! " said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door ; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle - like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof , which seemed to be caving — " Run for it ! " 
" We're done for ! " he moaned as the ceiling sagged , but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating — the engine had restarted . 
Harry yelled , and the car shot backward ; the tree was still trying to hit them ; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up , lashing out at them as they sped out of reach . 
" That , " panted Ron , " was close . 
Well done , car — " The car , however , had reached the end of its tether . 
With two sharp clunks , the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways : Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground . 
Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk ; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open ; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look . 
Then , dented , scratched , and steaming , the car rumbled off into the darkness , its rear lights blazing angrily . 
But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust . 
" Can you believe our luck ? " said Ron miserably , bending down to pick up Scabbers . 
" Of all the trees we could ' ve hit , we had to get one that hits back . " 
He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree , which was still flailing its branches threateningly . 
" Come on , " said Harry wearily , " we'd better get up to the school . . . 
Stiff , cold , and bruised , they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope , toward the great oak front doors . 
" I think the feast's already started , " said Ron , dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window . 
" Hey — Harry — come and look — it's the Sorting ! " 
Harry hurried over and , together , he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall . 
Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long , crowded tables , making the golden plates and goblets sparkle . 
Overhead , the bewitched ceiling , which always mirrored the sky outside , sparkled with stars . 
Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats , Harry saw a long line of scared - looking first years filing into the Hall . 
Ginny was among them , easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair . 
Meanwhile , Professor McGonagall , a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun , was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers . 
Every year , this aged old hat , patched , frayed , and dirty , sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses ( Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin ) . 
For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin , the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor , along with Ron , Hermione , and the rest of the Weasleys . 
Last term , Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship , beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years . 
A very small , mousy - haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head . 
Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore , the headmaster , sat watching the Sorting from the staff table , his long silver beard and half - moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight . 
Several seats along , Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart , dressed in robes of aquamarine . 
And there at the end was Hagrid , huge and hairy , drinking deeply from his goblet . 
" Hang on . . 
Where's Snape ? " Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher . 
" Maybe he's ill ! " said Ron hopefully . 
" Maybe he's left , " said Harry , " because he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again ! " " Or he might have been sacked ! " said Ron enthusiastically . 
Harry spun around . 
There , his black robes rippling in a cold breeze , stood Severus Snape . 
He was a thin man with sallow skin , a hooked nose , and greasy , shoulder - length black hair , and at this moment , he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble . 
" Follow me , " said Snape . 
Not daring even to look at each other , Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast , echoing entrance hall , which was lit with flaming torches . 
A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall , but Snape led them away from the warmth and light , down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons . 
They entered Snape's office , shivering . 
The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars , in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the moment . 
The fireplace was dark and empty . 
Snape closed the door and turned to look at them . 
" So , " he said softly , " the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick , Weasley . 
Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we , boys ? " " No , sir , it was the barrier at King's Cross , it — " 
" Silence ! " said Snape coldly . 
" What have you done with the car ? " Ron gulped . 
This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds . 
He began to read aloud : " Two Muggles in London , convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower . . . 
Mr. Angus Fleet , of Peebles , reported to police . . . 
" Dear , dear . . . 
his own son . . 
Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches . 
If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car . . . he hadn't thought of that . . . . 
" I noticed , in my search of the park , that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow , " Snape went on . 
" That tree did more damage to us than we — " Ron blurted out . 
" Most unfortunately , you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me . 
You will wait here . " 
Harry and Ron stared at each other , white - faced . 
He now felt extremely sick . 
He tried not to look at a large , slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape's desk . 
She might be fairer than Snape , but she was still extremely strict . 
Ten minutes later , Snape returned , and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him . 
Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions , but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go , or he had never seen her this angry before . 
She raised her wand the moment she entered ; Harry and Ron both flinched , but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace , where flames suddenly erupted . 
Ron launched into the story , starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through . 
" — so we had no choice , Professor , we couldn't get on the train . " 
I believe you have an owl ? " Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry . 
Harry gaped at her . 
Now she'd said it , that seemed the obvious thing to have done . 
" I — I didn't think — " " That , " said Professor McGonagall , " is obvious . " 
There was a knock on the office door and Snape , now looking happier than ever , opened it . 
Harry's whole body went numb . 
Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow . 
Then Dumbledore said , " Please explain why you did this . " 
Harry hated the disappointment in his voice . 
For some reason , he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes , and spoke instead to his knees . 
He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car , making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station . 
He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once , but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car . 
When Harry had finished , he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles . 
" We ' ll go and get our stuff , " said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice . 
" What are you talking about , Weasley ? " barked Professor McGonagall . 
Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore . 
" Not today , Mr. Weasley , " said Dumbledore . " But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done . 
I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again , I will have no choice but to expel you . " 
" They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility . " 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
" I must go back to the feast , Minerva , I ' ve got to give out a few notices . 
" Not much , " said Ron , hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve . 
" Professor , I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted — " " The Sorting Ceremony is over , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" But you will both get a detention . " 
It was better than Harry had expected . 
As for Dumbledore's writing to the Dursleys , that was nothing . 
Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk . 
A large plate of sandwiches , two silver goblets , and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop . 
" You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory , " she said . 
" I must also return to the feast . " 
" So did I , " said Harry , taking one , too . 
" Fred and George must ' ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them . " 
" Why couldn't we get through the barrier ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could ( the plate kept refilling itself ) , they rose and left the office , treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower . 
The castle was quiet ; it seemed that the feast was over . 
They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor , and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs , until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden , behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress . 
" Password ? " 
" Er — " said Harry . 
" There you are ! 
Where have you been ? 
" Skip the lecture , " said Ron impatiently , " and tell us the new password . " 
" It's ' wattlebird , ' " said Hermione impatiently , " but that's not the point — " Her words were cut short , however , as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping . 
It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake , packed into the circular common room , standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs , waiting for them to arrive . 
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside , leaving Hermione to scramble in after them . 
" Brilliant ! " yelled Lee Jordan . 
What an entrance ! 
Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow , people ' ll be talking about that one for years — " " Good for you , " said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to ; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon ; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together , " Why couldn't we ' ve come in the car , eh ? " 
Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years , and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off . 
Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction . 
Ron got the point at once . 
" Got to get upstairs — bit tired , " he said , and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room , which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories . 
" ' Night , " Harry called back to Hermione , who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's . 
They managed to get to the other side of the common room , still having their backs slapped , and gained the peace of the staircase . 
They hurried up it , right to the top , and at last reached the door of their old dormitory , which now had a sign on it saying second years . 
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry . 
" I know I shouldn't ' ve enjoyed that or anything , but — " The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys , Seamus Finnigan , Dean Thomas , and Neville Longbottom . 
" Unbelievable ! " beamed Seamus . 
" Cool , " said Dean . " Amazing , " said Neville , awestruck . 
He grinned , too . 
CHAPTER SIX : GILDEROY LOCKHART 
The next day , however , Harry barely grinned once . 
Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall . 
The four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge , plates of kippers , mountains of toast , and dishes of eggs and bacon , beneath the enchanted ceiling ( today , a dull , cloudy gray ) . 
Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione , who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug . 
There was a slight stiffness in the way she said " ' Morning , " which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived . 
Neville Longbottom , on the other hand , greeted them cheerfully . 
Neville was a round - faced and accident - prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met . 
" Mail's due any minute — I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot . " 
Harry had only just started his porridge when , sure enough , there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in , circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd . 
A big , lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and , a second later , something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug , spraying them all with milk and feathers . 
" Errol ! " said Ron , pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet . 
Errol slumped , unconscious , onto the table , his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak . 
" Oh , no — " Ron gasped . 
" It's all right , he's still alive , " said Hermione , prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger . 
" It's not that — it's that . " 
Ron was pointing at the red envelope . 
It looked quite ordinary to Harry , but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode . 
" What's the matter ? " said Harry . 
" She's — she's sent me a Howler , " said Ron faintly . 
" You'd better open it , Ron , " said Neville in a timid whisper . 
Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope . 
" What's a Howler ? " he said . 
But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter , which had begun to smoke at the corners . 
Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears . 
He thought for a moment it had exploded ; a roar of sound filled the huge hall , shaking dust from the ceiling . 
People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler , and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen . 
A ringing silence fell . 
The red envelope , which had dropped from Ron's hand , burst into flames and curled into ashes . 
Harry and Ron sat stunned , as though a tidal wave had just passed over them . 
Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head . 
" Well , I don't know what you expected , Ron , but you — " " Don't tell me I deserved it , " snapped Ron . 
Harry pushed his porridge away . 
Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work . 
After all Mr. and Mrs . Weasley had done for him over the summer . . . 
Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione left the castle together , crossed the vegetable patch , and made for the greenhouses , where the magical plants were kept . 
As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside , waiting for Professor Sprout . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn , accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages , and with another twinge of guilt , Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance , several of its branches now in slings . 
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair ; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint . 
But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is ! 
There was a murmur of interest . 
They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before — greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants . 
Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door . 
Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant , umbrella - sized flowers dangling from the ceiling . 
He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out . 
" Harry ! 
" Harry , " said Lockhart , his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head . 
" Harry , Harry , Harry . " 
Completely nonplussed , Harry said nothing . 
" When I heard — well , of course , it was all my fault . 
Harry had no idea what he was talking about . 
Flying a car to Hogwarts ! 
Well , of course , I knew at once why you'd done it . 
Stood out a mile . 
Harry , Harry , Harry . " 
" Gave you the bug . 
" Oh , no , Professor , see — " " Harry , Harry , Harry , " said Lockhart , reaching out and grasping his shoulder . 
" I understand . 
Natural to want a bit more once you ' ve had that first taste — and I blame myself for giving you that , because it was bound to go to your head — but see here , young man , you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed . 
Just calm down , all right ? 
Yes , yes , I know what you ' re thinking ! 
But when I was twelve , I was just as much of a nobody as you are now . 
I mean , a few people have heard of you , haven't they ? 
He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead . 
" I know , I know — it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's MostCharming - Smile Award five times in a row , as I have — but it's a start , Harry , it's a start . " 
He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off . 
Harry stood stunned for a few seconds , then , remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse , he opened the door and slid inside . 
Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse . 
When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione , she said , " We ' ll be repotting Mandrakes today . 
Now , who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake ? " 
To nobody's surprise , Hermione's hand was first into the air . 
" It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state . " 
" Excellent . 
Ten points to Gryffindor , " said Professor Sprout . 
" The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes . 
It is also , however , dangerous . 
Who can tell me why ? " Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again . 
Take another ten points , " said Professor Sprout . 
" Now , the Mandrakes we have here are still very young . " 
They looked quite unremarkable to Harry , who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the " cry " of the Mandrake . 
" Everyone take a pair of earmuffs , " said Professor Sprout . 
" When it is safe to remove them , I will give you the thumbs - up . 
Right — earmuffs on . " 
Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears . 
Professor Sprout put the pink , fluffy pair over her own ears , rolled up the sleeves of her robes , grasped one of the tufty plants firmly , and pulled hard . 
Instead of roots , a small , muddy , and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth . 
He had pale green , mottled skin , and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs . 
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it , burying him in dark , damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible . 
" Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula , it's teething . " 
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky , dark red plant as she spoke , making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly - haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to . 
" Know who you are , of course , the famous Harry Potter . . . . 
And you ' re Hermione Granger — always top in everything " 
The Howler was obviously still on his mind . 
Have you read his books ? 
I'd have died of fear if I'd been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf , but he stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic . 
I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead . 
Of course , Mother was slightly disappointed , but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it ' ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . 
After that they didn't have much chance to talk . 
Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes . 
Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy , but it wasn't . 
By the end of the class , Harry , like everyone else , was sweaty , aching , and covered in earth . 
Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration . 
Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work , but today was especially difficult . 
Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer . 
He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button , but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand . 
It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments , and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs . 
Unable to see what he was doing , Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one . 
Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased . 
Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell . 
Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron , who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk . 
" Defense Against the Dark Arts , " said Hermione at once . 
Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again . 
Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched . 
He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera , and the moment Harry looked at him , he went bright red . 
" All right , Harry ? 
I'm — I'm Colin Creevey , " he said breathlessly , taking a tentative step forward . 
" I'm in Gryffindor , too . 
" A picture ? " 
Harry repeated blankly . 
" I know all about you . 
Everyone's told me . 
About how you survived when You - Know - Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you ' ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead " ( his eyes raked Harry's hairline ) " and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion , the pictures ' ll move . " 
I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts . 
So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him . 
And then , could you sign it ? " 
" Everyone line up ! " Malfoy roared to the crowd . 
" Harry Potter's giving out signed photos ! " " No , I'm not , " said Harry angrily , his fists clenching . 
" Shut up , Malfoy . " 
" You ' re just jealous , " piped up Colin , whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck . 
" Of what ? 
Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly . 
" Eat slugs , Malfoy , " said Ron angrily . 
" Be careful , Weasley , " sneered Malfoy . 
" You don't want to start any trouble or your mommy ' ll have to come and take you away from school . " 
He put on a shrill , piercing voice . 
" Who's giving out signed photos ? " 
We meet again , Harry ! " Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation , Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd . 
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them , signaling the start of afternoon classes . 
" Off you go , move along there , " Lockhart called to the crowd , and he set off back to the castle with Harry , who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell , still clasped to his side . 
" A word to the wise , Harry , " said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door . 
Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class , where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him , so that he could avoid looking at the real thing . 
The rest of the class came clattering in , and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry . 
" Shut up , " snapped Harry . 
The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase " Harry Potter fan club . " 
When the whole class was seated , Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell . 
" Gilderoy Lockhart , Order of Merlin , Third Class , Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League , and five - time winner of Witch Weekly's Most - Charming - Smile Award — but I don't talk about that . 
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her ! " He waited for them to laugh ; a few people smiled weakly . 
" I see you ' ve all bought a complete set of my books — well done . 
I thought we'd start today with a little quiz . 
Nothing to worry about — just to check how well you ' ve read them , how much you ' ve taken in — " When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said , " You have thirty minutes — start — now ! " Harry looked down at his paper and read : 
1 . What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color ? 2 . What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition ? 
3 . What , in your opinion , is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date ? 
54 . 
When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday , and what would his ideal gift be ? 
Half an hour later , Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class . 
I say so in Year with the Yeti . 
And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non - magic peoples — though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky ! " 
Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face ; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas , who were sitting in front , were shaking with silent laughter . 
Hermione , on the other hand , was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name . 
but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair - care potions — good girl ! 
Where is Miss Hermione Granger ? " 
" Excellent ! " beamed Lockhart . 
Take ten points for Gryffindor ! 
It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind ! 
All I ask is that you remain calm . " 
Lockhart placed a hand on the cover . 
Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now . 
Neville was cowering in his front row seat . 
" I must ask you not to scream , " said Lockhart in a low voice . 
As the whole class held its breath , Lockhart whipped off the cover . 
" Yes , " he said dramatically . 
He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror . 
" Yes ? " 
He smiled at Seamus . 
" Well , they ' re not — they ' re not very — dangerous , are they ? " 
Seamus choked . 
The moment the cover had been removed , they had started jabbering and rocketing around , rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them . 
" Right , then , " Lockhart said loudly . 
And he opened the cage . 
It was pandemonium . 
Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air . 
Several shot straight through the window , showering the back row with broken glass . 
The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino . 
They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them , shredded books and papers , tore pictures from the walls , up - ended the waste basket , grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window ; within minutes , half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling . 
He rolled up his sleeves , brandished his wand , and bellowed , " Peskipiksi Pesternomi ! " 
It had absolutely no effect ; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window , too . 
In the relative calm that followed , Lockhart straightened up , caught sight of Harry , Ron , and Hermione , who were almost at the door , and said , " Well , I ' ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage . " 
" Can you believe him ? " 
roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear . 
" Hands on ? " said Harry , who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out . 
" You ' ve read his books — look at all those amazing things he's done — " " He says he's done , " Ron muttered . 
Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor . 
Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey , who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule . 
Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say , " All right , Harry ? " six or seven times a day and hear , " Hello , Colin , " back , however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it . 
Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning , surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes , creating a large , throbbing green boil where it had struck . 
He , Ron , and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning . 
" Whassamatter ? " said Harry groggily . 
" Quidditch practice ! " said Wood . " Come on ! " 
Harry squinted at the window . 
There was a thin mist hanging across the pink - and - gold sky . 
Now that he was awake , he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making . 
" Oliver , " Harry croaked . 
" It's the crack of dawn . " 
" Exactly , " said Wood . 
He was a tall and burly sixth year and , at the moment , his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm . 
" It's part of our new training program . 
" None of the other teams have started training yet ; we ' re going to be first off the mark this year — " Yawning and shivering slightly , Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes . 
" Good man , " said Wood . " Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes . " 
When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth , Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room , his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder . 
He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase , his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand . 
" I heard someone saying your name on the stairs , Harry ! 
Look what I ' ve got here ! 
I ' ve had it developed , I wanted to show you — " 
Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose . 
A moving , black - and - white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own . 
He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view . 
As Harry watched , Lockhart gave up and slumped , panting , against the white edge of the picture . 
" No , " said Harry flatly , glancing around to check that the room was really deserted . 
" Oh , wow ! Wait for me ! 
I ' ve never watched a Quidditch game before ! " 
Colin scrambled through the hole after him . 
" It ' ll be really boring , " Harry said quickly , but Colin ignored him , his face shining with excitement . 
" You were the youngest House player in a hundred years , weren't you , Harry ? 
" You must be brilliant . 
I ' ve never flown . 
Is it easy ? 
Is that your own broom ? 
Is that the best one there is ? " Harry didn't know how to get rid of him . 
" I don't really understand Quidditch , " said Colin breathlessly . 
" Is it true there are four balls ? 
" Yes , " said Harry heavily , resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch . 
Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters . " 
" And what are the other balls for ? " 
Colin asked , tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open - mouthed at Harry . 
" Well , the Quaffle — that's the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals . 
Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch — they ' re three long poles with hoops on the end . " 
" And the fourth ball — " " — is the Golden Snitch , " said Harry , " and it's very small , very fast , and difficult to catch . 
And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points . " 
" And you ' re the Gryffindor Seeker , aren't you ? " said Colin in awe . 
" Yes , " said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew - drenched grass . 
That's it , really . " 
But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field , and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms ; Colin called after him in a piping voice , " I ' ll go and get a good seat , Harry ! " and hurried off to the stands . 
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room . 
Fred and George Weasley were sitting , puffy - eyed and touslehaired , next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet , who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her . 
" There you are , Harry , what kept you ? " said Wood briskly . 
" Now , I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field , because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program , which I really think will make all the difference . . . 
Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field , on which were drawn many lines , arrows , and crosses in differentcolored inks . 
He took out his wand , tapped the board , and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars . 
As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics , Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore . 
Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on . 
" Is that clear ? 
Any questions ? " " I ' ve got a question , Oliver , " said George , who had woken with a start . 
" Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake ? " 
" We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year . 
We're easily the best team . 
But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our control — " 
Harry shifted guiltily in his seat . 
He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year , meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years . 
Wood took a moment to regain control of himself . 
Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him . 
" So this year , we train harder than ever before . . . . 
Okay , let's go and put our new theories into practice ! " 
Wood shouted , seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms . 
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now , although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium . 
As Harry walked onto the field , he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands . 
" Haven't even started , " said Harry , looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall . 
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground , soaring up into the air . 
He soared right around the stadium at full speed , racing Fred and George . 
Harry looked into the stands . 
Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats , his camera raised , taking picture after picture , the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium . 
" Look this way , Harry ! 
" What's going on ? " said Wood , frowning , as he skimmed through the air toward them . 
I don't like it . 
He could be a Slytherin spy , trying to find out about our new training program . " 
" He's in Gryffindor , " said Harry quickly . 
" What makes you say that ? " said Wood testily . 
" Because they ' re here in person , " said George , pointing . 
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field , broomsticks in their hands . 
" I don't believe it ! " 
Wood hissed in outrage . 
" I booked the field for today ! 
We ' ll see about this ! " Wood shot toward the ground , landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger , staggering slightly as he dismounted . 
Harry , Fred , and George followed . 
" Flint ! " 
Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain . 
" This is our practice time ! 
He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied , " Plenty of room for all of us , Wood . " 
Angelina , Alicia , and Katie had come over , too . 
" I booked it ! " 
" Ah , " said Flint . 
' I , Professor S . Snape , give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker . ' " 
" You ' ve got a new Seeker ? " said Wood , distracted . 
" Where ? " 
It was Draco Malfoy . 
" Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son ? " said Fred , looking at Malfoy with dislike . 
" Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team . " 
Seven highly polished , brand - new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors ' noses in the early morning sun . 
As for the old Cleansweeps " — he smiled nastily at Fred and George , who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives — " sweeps the board with them . " 
None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment . 
Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits . 
" Oh , look , " said Flint . 
" A field invasion . " 
Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on . 
" What's happening ? " 
Ron asked Harry . 
" Why aren't you playing ? 
And what's he doing here ? " 
He was looking at Malfoy , taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes . 
" I'm the new Slytherin Seeker , Weasley , " said Malfoy , smugly . 
Ron gaped , openmouthed , at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him . 
" Good , aren't they ? " said Malfoy smoothly . 
" But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms , too . 
" At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in , " said Hermione sharply . 
" They got in on pure talent . " 
The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered . 
Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words . 
Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him , Alicia shrieked , " How dare you ! " , and Ron plunged his hand into his robes , pulled out his wand , yelling , " You ' ll pay for that one , Malfoy ! " and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoy's face . 
A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand , hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass . 
" Ron ! Ron ! Are you all right ? " 
squealed Hermione . 
Ron opened his mouth to speak , but no words came out . 
Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap . 
Malfoy was on all fours , banging the ground with his fist . 
Nobody seemed to want to touch him . 
" We'd better get him to Hagrid's , it's nearest , " said Harry to Hermione , who nodded bravely , and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms . 
" What happened , Harry ? 
What happened ? 
" Can you hold him still , Harry ? " " Get out of the way , Colin ! " said Harry angrily . 
He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest . 
" It's a simple matter if you know what you ' re doing ! " Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid . 
" If you need help , you know where I am ! I ' ll let you have a copy of my book . 
I'm surprised you haven't already got one — I ' ll sign one tonight and send it over . 
Well , good - bye ! " 
And he strode away toward the castle . 
Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight , then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid's front door . 
" Bin wonderin ' when you'd come ter see me — come in , come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again — " Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one - roomed cabin , which had an enormous bed in one corner , a fire crackling merrily in the other . 
" Better out than in , " he said cheerfully , plunking a large copper basin in front of him . 
" What did Lockhart want with you , Hagrid ? " 
Harry asked , scratching Fang's ears . 
Hagrid , moving a half - plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot . 
" Like I don ' know . 
Hermione , however , said in a voice somewhat higher than usual , " I think you ' re being a bit unfair . 
Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job — " " He was the on ' y man for the job , " said Hagrid , offering them a plate of treacle toffee , while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin . 
" He didn ' ! " he growled at Hermione . 
" He did , " she said . 
" But I don't know what it means . 
He gave a small burp , and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand . 
He threw it into the basin and continued , " I mean , the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all . 
It's ridiculous . 
" I have not been giving out signed photos , " he said hotly . 
But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing . 
" I'm on ' y jokin ' , " he said , patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table . 
" An'then I told him I'd never read one o ' his books an ' he decided ter go . 
Treacle toffee , Ron ? " he added as Ron reappeared . 
" No thanks , " said Ron weakly . 
" Better not risk it . " 
" Come an'see what I ' ve bin growin ' , " said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea . 
In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen . 
Each was the size of a large boulder . 
" What ' ve you been feeding them ? " said Harry . 
Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone . 
Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked ; in fact , he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it . 
Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic . 
He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year , but Harry had never found out why — any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed . 
" Well , you ' ve done a good job on them . " 
" That's what yer little sister said , " said Hagrid , nodding at Ron . " Met her jus ' yesterday . " 
Hagrid looked sideways at Harry , his beard twitching . 
" Said she was jus ' lookin ' round the grounds , but I reckon she was hopin'she might run inter someone else at my house . " 
He winked at Harry . 
Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs . 
" Watch it ! " 
Hagrid roared , pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins . 
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn , he was keen to go back to school to eat . 
They said good - bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle , Ron hiccoughing occasionally , but only bringing up two very small slugs . 
" You will both do your detentions this evening . " 
" You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" And no magic , Weasley — elbow grease . " 
Ron gulped . 
Argus Filch , the caretaker , was loathed by every student in the school . 
" And you , Potter , will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Certainly not , " said Professor McGonagall , raising her eyebrows . 
" Professor Lockhart requested you particularly . 
Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as much as he'd thought . 
Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal . 
" No magic ! 
" I'd swap anytime , " said Harry hollowly . 
Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away , and in what seemed like no time , it was five minutes to eight , and Harry was dragging his feet along the second - floor corridor to Lockhart's office . 
He gritted his teeth and knocked . 
Lockhart beamed down at him . 
" Ah , here's the scalawag ! " he said . 
" Come in , Harry , come in — " Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart . 
" This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon , bless her — huge fan of mine — " The minutes snailed by . 
The candles burned lower and lower , making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him . 
And then he heard something — something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans . 
It was a voice , a voice to chill the bone marrow , a voice of breathtaking , ice - cold venom . 
" Come . . . 
come to me . . . . 
Let me rip you . . . . 
Let me tear you . . . . 
Let me kill you . . . 
Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street . 
" What ? " he said loudly . 
" I know ! " said Lockhart . 
" Six solid months at the top of the best - seller list ! 
Broke all records ! " " No , " said Harry frantically . 
" That voice ! " " Sorry ? " said Lockhart , looking puzzled . 
" What voice ? " " That — that voice that said — didn't you hear it ? " 
" What are you talking about , Harry ? 
Great Scott — look at the time ! 
" We ' ve been here nearly four hours ! 
I'd never have believed it — the time's flown , hasn't it ? " 
Harry didn't answer . 
He was straining his ears to hear the voice again , but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention . 
Feeling dazed , Harry left . 
It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty . 
Harry went straight up to the dormitory . 
Half an hour later , Ron arrived , nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room . 
Took ages to get the slime off . . . . 
Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville , Dean , and Seamus , Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard . 
" And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it ? " said Ron . 
Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight . 
" D ' you think he was lying ? 
" I know , " said Harry , lying back in his four - poster and staring at the canopy above him . 
" I don't get it either . " 
October arrived , spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle . 
Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students . 
The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire . 
Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end ; the lake rose , the flower beds turned into muddy streams , and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds . 
Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions , however , was not dampened , which was why Harry was to be found , late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween , returning to Gryffindor Tower , drenched to the skin and splattered with mud . 
Fred and George , who had been spying on the Slytherin team , had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones . 
They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs , shooting through the air like missiles . 
As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was . 
. " " Hello , Nick , " said Harry . 
He wore a dashing , plumed hat on his long curly hair , and a tunic with a ruff , which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed . 
He was pale as smoke , and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside . 
" So do you , " said Harry . 
Thought I'd apply , but apparently I'don't fulfill requirements ' — " In spite of his airy tone , there was a look of great bitterness on his face . 
" But you would think , wouldn't you , " he erupted suddenly , pulling the letter back out of his pocket , " that getting hit forty - five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt ? " 
" Oh — yes , " said Harry , who was obviously supposed to agree . 
However — " Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously : 
" ' We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies . 
It is with the greatest regret , therefore , that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements . 
With very best wishes , Sir Patrick Delaney - Podmore . ' " 
Anything I can do ? " " No , " said Harry . 
" Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly — " The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high - pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles . 
He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp - like yellow eyes . 
It was Mrs . Norris , the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker , Argus Filch , as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students . 
" You'd better get out of here , Harry , " said Nick quickly . 
Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat , Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right , wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule - breaker . 
There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head , and his nose was unusually purple . 
" Filth ! " he shouted , his jowls aquiver , his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes . 
I ' ve had enough of it , I tell you ! 
Follow me , Potter ! " 
So Harry waved a gloomy good - bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs , doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor . 
Harry had never been inside Filch's office before ; it was a place most students avoided . 
The room was dingy and windowless , lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling . 
A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place . 
Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls ; from their labels , Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished . 
Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves . 
A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk . 
I ' ve had enough of it . . . 
where's the form . . . 
yes . . 
He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him , dipping his long black quill into the ink pot . 
" Name . . . 
Harry Potter . 
. " " It was only a bit of mud ! " said Harry . 
" It's only a bit of mud to you , boy , but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing ! " 
shouted Filch , a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose . 
befouling the castle . . . 
suggested sentence . . 
Dabbing at his streaming nose , Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry , who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall . 
But as Filch lowered his quill , there was a great BANG ! on the ceiling of the office , which made the oil lamp rattle . 
" I ' ll have you this time , I ' ll have you ! " 
Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back , Harry sank into a moth - eaten chair next to the desk . 
There was only one thing on it apart from his half - completed form : a large , glossy , purple envelope with silver lettering on the front . 
With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back , Harry picked up the envelope and read : 
Intrigued , Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside . 
More curly silver writing on the front page said : 
Feel out of step in the world of modern magic ? 
There is an answer ! 
Kwikspell is an all - new , fail - safe , quick - result , easy - learn course . 
Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method ! 
Now , after a Kwikspell course , I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution ! " 
Warlock D . J . Prod of Didsbury says : " My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms , but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak ! Thank you , Kwikspell ! " 
Fascinated , Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents . 
Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope , Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened . 
" That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable ! " he was saying gleefully to Mrs . Norris . 
Filch's pasty face went brick red . 
Filch hobbled across to his desk , snatched up the envelope , and threw it into a drawer . 
" Have you — did you read — ? " he sputtered . 
" No , " Harry lied quickly . 
Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together . 
" If I thought you'd read my private — not that it's mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — " Harry was staring at him , alarmed ; Filch had never looked madder . 
His eyes were popping , a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks , and the tartan scarf didn't help . 
" Very well — go — and don't breathe a word — not that — however , if you didn't read — go now , I have to write up Peeves ' report — go — " 
Amazed at his luck , Harry sped out of the office , up the corridor , and back upstairs . 
" Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Thanks , Nick ! " 
They set off up the corridor together . 
Nearly Headless Nick , Harry noticed , was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter . 
" I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt , " Harry said . 
" But there is something you could do for me , " said Nick excitedly . 
" Harry — would I be asking too much — but no , you wouldn't want — " " What is it ? " said Harry . 
" Right . " 
" I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons . 
He watched Harry on tenterhooks . 
" No , " said Harry quickly , " I ' ll come — " " My dear boy ! 
Harry Potter , at my deathday party ! 
" A deathday party ? " said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room . 
The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading , talking , doing homework or , in the case of Fred and George Weasley , trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander . 
Fred had " rescued " the brilliant orange , fire - dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people . 
Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air , emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room . 
The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George , the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth , and its escape into the fire , with accompanying explosions , drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind . 
By the time Halloween arrived , Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party . 
The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast ; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats , Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in , and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment . 
" You said you'd go to the deathday party . " 
So at seven o ' clock , Harry , Ron , and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall , which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles , and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons . 
" Is that supposed to be music ? " 
Ron whispered . 
They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes . 
" My dear friends , " he said mournfully . 
" Welcome , welcome . . . 
so pleased you could come . . . 
He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside . 
It was an incredible sight . 
The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly - white , translucent people , mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor , waltzing to the dreadful , quavering sound of thirty musical saws , played by an orchestra on a raised , black - draped platform . 
" Shall we have a look around ? " 
Harry suggested , wanting to warm up his feet . 
" Careful not to walk through anyone , " said Ron nervously , and they set off around the edge of the dance floor . 
They passed a group of gloomy nuns , a ragged man wearing chains , and the Fat Friar , a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost , who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead . 
Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron , a gaunt , staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains , was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts . 
" Oh , no , " said Hermione , stopping abruptly . 
" Turn back , turn back , I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle — " " Who ? " said Harry as they backtracked quickly . 
" She haunts one of the toilets in the girls ' bathroom on the first floor , " said Hermione . 
" She haunts a toilet ? " 
" Yes . 
I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it ; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you — " " Look , food ! " said Ron . 
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table , also covered in black velvet . 
Large , rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters ; cakes , burned charcoal - black , were heaped on salvers ; there was a great maggoty haggis , a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and , in pride of place , an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone , with tar - like icing forming the words , 
" Can you taste it if you walk through it ? " 
Harry asked him . 
" Almost , " said the ghost sadly , and he drifted away . 
I feel sick , " said Ron . 
" Hello , Peeves , " said Harry cautiously . 
Unlike the ghosts around them , Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent . 
He was wearing a bright orange party hat , a revolving bow tie , and a broad grin on his wide , wicked face . 
" No thanks , " said Hermione . 
" I didn't mean it , I don't mind her — er , hello , Myrtle . " 
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over . 
" What ? " she said sulkily . 
" How are you , Myrtle ? " said Hermione in a falsely bright voice . 
" It's nice to see you out of the toilet . " 
Myrtle sniffed . 
" Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight , " said Hermione , glaring at Peeves . 
Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously . 
" D ' you think I don't know what people call me behind my back ? 
Fat Myrtle ! 
Ugly Myrtle ! 
Pimply ! " " Oh , dear , " said Hermione sadly . 
The orchestra , however , stopped playing at that very moment . 
They , and everyone else in the dungeon , fell silent , looking around in excitement , as a hunting horn sounded . 
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses , each ridden by a headless horseman . 
The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted , rearing and plunging . 
At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm , from which position he was blowing the horn . 
The ghost leapt down , lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd ( everyone laughed ) , and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick , squashing his head back onto his neck . 
" Nick ! " he roared . 
" How are you ? 
" Don't mind Nick ! " shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor . 
" My late lamented lords , ladies , and gentlemen , it is my great sorrow . . 
Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch . 
" I can't stand much more of this , " Ron muttered , his teeth chattering , as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor . 
" Let's go , " Harry agreed . 
They backed toward the door , nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them , and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles . 
" Pudding might not be finished yet , " said Ron hopefully , leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall . 
And then Harry heard it . 
tear . . . 
kill . . 
It was the same voice , the same cold , murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office . 
He stumbled to a halt , clutching at the stone wall , listening with all his might , looking around , squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway . 
for so long . . 
. " " Listen ! " said Harry urgently , and Ron and Hermione froze , watching him . 
kill . . . 
time to kill . . 
The voice was growing fainter . 
Harry was sure it was moving away — moving upward . 
A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling ; how could it be moving upward ? 
" This way , " he shouted , and he began to run , up the stairs , into the entrance hall . 
It was no good hoping to hear anything here , the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall . 
Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor , Ron and Hermione clattering behind him . 
Harry strained his ears . 
Distantly , from the floor above , and growing fainter still , he heard the voice : " . . . 
I smell blood . . . . 
I SMELL BLOOD ! " His stomach lurched — " It's going to kill someone ! " he shouted , and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces , he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time , trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps — Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor , Ron and Hermione panting behind him , not stopping until they turned a corner into the last , deserted passage . 
" I couldn't hear anything . . . 
But Hermione gave a sudden gasp , pointing down the corridor . 
" Look ! " Something was shining on the wall ahead . 
They approached slowly , squinting through the darkness . 
Foot - high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows , shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches . 
" What's that thing — hanging underneath ? " said Ron , a slight quiver in his voice . 
As they edged nearer , Harry almost slipped — there was a large puddle of water on the floor ; Ron and Hermione grabbed him , and they inched toward the message , eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it . 
Mrs . Norris , the caretaker's cat , was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket . 
She was stiff as a board , her eyes wide and staring . 
Then Ron said , " Let's get out of here . " 
But it was too late . 
From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs , and the loud , happy talk of well - fed people ; next moment , students were crashing into the passage from both ends . 
The chatter , the bustle , the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood alone , in the middle of the corridor , as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight . 
" Enemies of the Heir , beware ! 
It was Draco Malfoy . 
He had pushed to the front of the crowd , his cold eyes alive , his usually bloodless face flushed , as he grinned at the sight of the hanging , immobile cat . 
What's going on here ? 
What's going on ? " Attracted no doubt by Malfoy's shout , Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd . 
" My cat ! 
My cat ! What's happened to Mrs . Norris ? " he shrieked . 
" You ! " he screeched . 
" You ! 
You ' ve murdered my cat ! You ' ve killed her ! I ' ll kill you ! 
I ' ll — " " Argus ! " 
In seconds , he had swept past Harry , Ron , and Hermione and detached Mrs . Norris from the torch bracket . 
" You , too , Mr. Potter , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger . " 
Lockhart stepped forward eagerly . 
Lockhart , looking excited and important , hurried after Dumbledore ; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape . 
As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls ; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight , their hair in rollers . 
The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back . 
Dumbledore laid Mrs . Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight , watching . 
The tip of Dumbledore's long , crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs . Norris's fur . 
Snape loomed behind them , half in shadow , wearing a most peculiar expression : It was as though he was trying hard not to smile . 
" It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably the Transmogrifian Torture — I ' ve seen it used many times , so unlucky I wasn't there , I know the very countercurse that would have saved her . . . 
Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry , racking sobs . 
He was slumped in a chair by the desk , unable to look at Mrs . Norris , his face in his hands . 
If Dumbledore believed Filch , he would be expelled for sure . 
I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou , " said Lockhart , " a series of attacks , the full story's in my autobiography , I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets , which cleared the matter up at once . . . 
At last Dumbledore straightened up . 
" She's not dead , Argus , " he said softly . 
Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented . 
I thought so ! " said Lockhart ) . 
" But how , I cannot say . . . 
. " " Ask him ! " shrieked Filch , turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry . 
" No second year could have done this , " said Dumbledore firmly . 
Filch spat , his pouchy face purpling . 
He found — in my office — he knows I'm a — I'm a — " Filch's face worked horribly . 
" He knows I'm a Squib ! " he finished . 
" I never touched Mrs . Norris ! " 
Harry said loudly , uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him , including all the Lockharts on the walls . 
" And I don't even know what a Squib is . " " Rubbish ! " 
snarled Filch . 
" Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time , " he said , a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it . 
" But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here . 
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party . 
there were hundreds of ghosts , they ' ll tell you we were there — " " But why not join the feast afterward ? " said Snape , his black eyes glittering in the candlelight . 
" Why go up to that corridor ? " 
Ron and Hermione looked at Harry . 
" Because — because — " Harry said , his heart thumping very fast ; something told him it would sound very far - fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear , " because we were tired and wanted to go to bed , " he said . 
" It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story . 
I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest . " 
" Really , Severus , " said Professor McGonagall sharply , " I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch . 
There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong . " 
Snape looked furious . 
So did Filch . 
" I want to see some punishment ! " " We will be able to cure her , Argus , " said Dumbledore patiently . 
" Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes . 
" I must have done it a hundred times . 
" But I believe I am the Potions master at this school . " 
" You may go , " Dumbledore said to Harry , Ron , and Hermione . 
When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office , they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them . 
" D ' you think I should have told them about that voice I heard ? " " No , " said Ron , without hesitation . 
" Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign , even in the wizarding world . " 
Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask , " You do believe me , don't you ? " " ' Course I do , " said Ron quickly . 
" But — you must admit it's weird . . . 
. " " I know it's weird , " said Harry . 
What was that writing on the wall about ? 
" I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once . . . 
might ' ve been Bill . . . 
. " " And what on earth's a Squib ? " said Harry . 
" Well — it's not funny really — but as it's Filch , " he said . 
" A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers . 
If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course , I reckon he must be a Squib . 
" He's bitter . " 
A clock chimed somewhere . 
" Midnight , " said Harry . 
For a few days , the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs . Norris . 
Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked , as though he thought the attacker might come back . 
Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs . Skower's All - Purpose Magical Mess Remover , but to no effect ; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone . 
When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime , he was skulking red - eyed through the corridors , lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like " breathing loudly " and " looking happy . " 
According to Ron , she was a great cat lover . 
" Honestly , we ' re much better off without her . " 
Ginny's lip trembled . 
" Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts , " Ron assured her . 
I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled . 
The attack had also had an effect on Hermione . 
It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading , but she was now doing almost nothing else . 
Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to , and not until the following Wednesday did they find out . 
Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him , turned abruptly , and sped off in the opposite direction . 
Harry found Ron at the back of the library , measuring his History of Magic homework . 
" I don't believe it , I'm still eight inches short . . . 
" Somewhere over there , " said Ron , pointing along the shelves . 
" Looking for another book . 
I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas . " 
Harry told Ron about Justin Finch - Fletchley running away from him . 
I thought he was a bit of an idiot , " said Ron , scribbling away , making his writing as large as possible . 
She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them . 
" All the copies of Hogwarts , A History have been taken out , " she said , sitting down next to Harry and Ron . 
" And there's a two - week waiting list . 
I wish I hadn't left my copy at home , but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books . " 
" Why do you want it ? " said Harry . 
" The same reason everyone else wants it , " said Hermione , " to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets . " 
" What's that ? " said Harry quickly . 
" That's just it . 
I can't remember , " said Hermione , biting her lip . 
" No , I won't , " said Hermione , suddenly severe . 
Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic , bickering . 
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule . 
Professor Binns , who taught it , was their only ghost teacher , and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard . 
Ancient and shriveled , many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead . 
He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire ; his routine had not varied in the slightest since . 
Today was as boring as ever . 
Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor , occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date , then falling asleep again . 
He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before . 
Hermione put up her hand . 
Professor Binns , glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec - 
ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289 , looked amazed . 
I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets , " said Hermione in a clear voice . 
Dean Thomas , who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open , gazing out of the window , jerked out of his trance ; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk . 
Professor Binns blinked . 
" My subject is History of Magic , " he said in his dry , wheezy voice . 
He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk snapping and continued , " In September of that year , a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers — " He stuttered to a halt . 
Hermione's hand was waving in the air again . 
He looked dimly at them all , every face turned to his . 
" Oh , very well , " he said slowly . 
" Let me see . . . the Chamber of Secrets . . . 
" You all know , of course , that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age . 
He paused , gazed blearily around the room , and continued . 
" For a few years , the founders worked in harmony together , seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated . 
Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts . 
After a while , there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor , and Slytherin left the school . " 
Professor Binns paused again , pursing his lips , looking like a wrinkled old tortoise . 
" But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets . 
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle , of which the other founders knew nothing . 
" Slytherin , according to the legend , sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school . 
The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets , unleash the horror within , and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic . " 
Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed . 
" Naturally , the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber , many times , by the most learned witches and wizards . 
It does not exist . 
Hermione's hand was back in the air . 
" Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ' horror within'the Chamber ? " " That is believed to be some sort of monster , which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control , " said Professor Binns in his dry , reedy voice . 
" There is no Chamber and no monster . " 
" That will do , " he said sharply . 
" It is a myth ! 
It does not exist ! 
There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard ! 
I regret telling you such a foolish story ! 
We will return , if you please , to history , to solid , believable , verifiable fact ! " 
" I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony , " Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner . 
Honestly , if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin , I'd ' ve got the train straight back home . . . 
Hermione nodded fervently , but Harry didn't say anything . 
His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly . 
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin . 
He could remember , as though it were yesterday , the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before : You could be great , you know , it's all here in your head , and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that . . . . 
But Harry , who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputation for turning out Dark wizards , had thought desperately , Not Slytherin ! 
" Hiya , Harry ! " " Hullo , Colin , " said Harry automatically . 
" Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you ' re — " But Colin was so small he couldn't fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall ; they heard him squeak , " See you , Harry ! " and he was gone . 
" That I'm Slytherin's heir , I expect , " said Harry , his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch - Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime . 
" People here ' ll believe anything , " said Ron in disgust . 
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty . 
" D ' you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets ? " Ron asked Hermione . 
" I don't know , " she said , frowning . 
Mrs . Norris , and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be — well — human . " 
As she spoke , they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened . 
They stopped and looked . 
The scene was just as it had been that night , except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket , and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message " The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened . " 
They looked at each other . 
The corridor was deserted . 
" Scorch marks ! " he said . 
" Here — and here — " " Come and look at this ! " said Hermione . 
" This is funny . . . 
Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall . 
Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane , where around twenty spiders were scuttling , apparently fighting to get through a small crack . 
A long , silvery thread was dangling like a rope , as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside . 
" Have you ever seen spiders act like that ? " said Hermione wonderingly . 
" No , " said Harry , " have you , Ron ? Ron ? " 
He looked over his shoulder . 
Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run . 
" What's up ? " said Harry . 
" I — don't — like — spiders , " said Ron tensely . 
" I just don't like the way they move . . . 
Hermione giggled . 
" It's not funny , " said Ron , fiercely . 
" If you must know , when I was three , Fred turned my — my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick . . . . 
Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh . 
Feeling they had better get off the subject , Harry said , " Remember all that water on the floor ? 
Someone's mopped it up . " 
" It was about here , " said Ron , recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing . 
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he'd been burned . 
" What's the matter ? " said Harry . 
" Can't go in there , " said Ron gruffly . 
" That's a girls ' toilet . " 
" That's Moaning Myrtle's place . 
Come on , let's have a look . " 
And ignoring the large out of order sign , she opened the door . 
It was the gloomiest , most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in . 
Under a large , cracked , and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks . 
The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles , burning low in their holders ; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges . 
Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall . 
Harry and Ron went to look . 
Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet , picking a spot on her chin . 
" This is a girls ' bathroom , " she said , eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously . 
" They're not girls . " 
" No , " Hermione agreed . 
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor . 
" Ask her if she saw anything , " Harry mouthed at Hermione . 
" What are you whispering ? " said Myrtle , staring at him . 
" Nothing , " said Harry quickly . 
" I do have feelings , you know , even if I am dead — " " Myrtle , no one wants to upset you , " said Hermione . 
" Harry only — " " No one wants to upset me ! 
That's a good one ! " 
howled Myrtle . 
" Did you see anyone near here that night ? " said Harry . 
" Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself . 
Then , of course , I remembered that I'm — that I'm — " " Already dead , " said Ron helpfully . 
Myrtle gave a tragic sob , rose up in the air , turned over , and dived headfirst into the toilet , splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight , although from the direction of her muffled sobs , she had come to rest somewhere in the U - bend . 
Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open , but Hermione shrugged wearily and said , " Honestly , that was almost cheerful for Myrtle . . . . 
Come on , let's go . " 
" RON ! " Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs , prefect badge agleam , an expression of complete shock on his face . 
" Don't you care what this looks like ? 
" And I hope it teaches you a lesson ! 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night . 
When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges , it ignited the parchment . 
she said in a quiet voice , as though continuing a conversation they had just been having . 
" Let's think , " said Ron in mock puzzlement . 
He looked at Hermione . 
Hermione looked back , unconvinced . 
" Look at his family , " said Harry , closing his books , too . 
" They could ' ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries ! " said Ron . " Handing it down , father to son . . . 
. " " Well , " said Hermione cautiously , " I suppose it's possible . . . 
. " " But how do we prove it ? " said Harry darkly . 
" Of course , it would be difficult . 
And dangerous , very dangerous . 
" All right , " said Hermione coldly . 
" What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us . " 
" But that's impossible , " Harry said as Ron laughed . 
" No , it's not , " said Hermione . 
" What's that ? " said Ron and Harry together . 
" Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — " " D ' you think we ' ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape ? " muttered Ron . 
Think about it ! 
We could change into three of the Slytherins . 
No one would know it was us . 
Malfoy would probably tell us anything . 
He's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now , if only we could hear him . " 
Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library . " 
There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section : You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher . 
" Hard to see why we'd want the book , really , " said Ron , " if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions . " 
" I think , " said Hermione , " that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory , we might stand a chance . . . 
Since the disastrous episode of the pixies , Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class . 
He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions ; so far , Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse , a yeti with a head cold , and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him . 
Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson , this time acting a werewolf . 
If he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood , he would have refused to do it . 
" Nice loud howl , Harry — exactly — and then , if you ' ll believe it , I pounced — like this — slammed him to the floor — thus — with one hand , I managed to hold him down — with my other , I 
put my wand to his throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm — he let out a piteous moan — go on , Harry — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man . 
The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet . 
" Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf ! 
Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one ! " 
The class began to leave . 
Harry returned to the back of the room , where Ron and Hermione were waiting . 
" Ready ? " 
Harry muttered . 
" Wait till everyone's gone , " said Hermione nervously . 
" All right . . 
She approached Lockhart's desk , a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand , Harry and Ron right behind her . 
" Er — Professor Lockhart ? " 
Hermione stammered . 
" I wanted to — to get this book out of the library . 
She held out the piece of paper , her hand shaking slightly . 
" But the thing is , it's in the Restricted Section of the library , so I need a teacher to sign for it — I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow - acting venoms — " " Ah , Gadding with Ghouls ! " said Lockhart , taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her . " Possibly my very favorite book . 
You enjoyed it ? " 
" Oh , yes , " said Hermione eagerly . 
" So clever , the way you trapped that last one with the tea - strainer — " " Well , I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help , " said Lockhart warmly , and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill . 
" So , Harry , " said Lockhart , while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag . 
" Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season , I believe ? 
Gryffindor against Slytherin , is it not ? 
I hear you ' re a useful player . 
I was a Seeker , too . 
I was asked to try for the National Squad , but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces . 
Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players . . . 
Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione . 
" I don't believe it , " he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note . 
" He didn't even look at the book we wanted . " 
" Just because he said you were the best student of the year — " They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library . 
Madam Pince , the librarian , was a thin , irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture . 
" I was wondering if I could keep it , " she said breathlessly . 
Madam Pince held the note up to the light , as though determined to detect a forgery , but it passed the test . 
Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left , trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty . 
Five minutes later , they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out - of - order bathroom once again . 
Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully , and the three of them bent over the damp - spotted pages . 
Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about , and there were some very unpleasant illustrations , which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head . 
It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people . 
Harry sin - 
cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces . 
" This is the most complicated potion I ' ve ever seen , " said Hermione as they scanned the recipe . 
" Lacewing flies , leeches , fluxweed , and knotgrass , " she murmured , running her finger down the list of ingredients . 
Oooh , look , powdered horn of a bicorn — don't know where we ' re going to get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that ' ll be tricky , too — and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into . " 
" Excuse me ? " said Ron sharply . 
Ron turned , speechless , to Harry , who had another worry . 
" D ' you realize how much we ' re going to have to steal , Hermione ? 
What ' re we going to do , break into Snape's private stores ? 
Hermione shut the book with a snap . 
" Well , if you two are going to chicken out , fine , " she said . 
There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual . 
" I don't want to break rules , you know . 
I think threatening Muggle - borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion . 
But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy , I ' ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in — " 
" Well , since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty - one days . . . 
Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match . 
He was nervous , mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost , but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy . 
He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly . 
After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning , he got up , dressed , and went down to breakfast early , where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long , empty table , all looking uptight and not speaking much . 
As eleven o ' clock approached , the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium . 
It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air . 
Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms . 
The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes , then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre - match pep talk . 
" Slytherin has better brooms than us , " he began . 
" No point denying it . 
But we ' ve got better people on our brooms . 
Chest heaving with emotion , Wood turned to Harry . 
" It ' ll be down to you , Harry , to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father . 
Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying , Harry , because we ' ve got to win today , we ' ve got to . " 
" So no pressure , Harry , " said Fred , winking at him . 
As they walked out onto the field , a roar of noise greeted them ; mainly cheers , because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten , but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard , too . 
" On my whistle , " said Madam Hooch . 
" Three . . . 
two . . . 
one . . 
With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward , the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky . 
Harry flew higher than any of them , squinting around for the Snitch . 
" All right there , Scarhead ? " 
Harry had no time to reply . 
" Close one , Harry ! " said George , streaking past him with his club in his hand , ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin . 
Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey , but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again . 
Harry dropped quickly to avoid it , and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy . 
Once again , the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head . 
Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the field . 
He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him . 
What was going on ? 
Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end . 
Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might ; the Bludger was knocked off course . 
" Gotcha ! " Fred yelled happily , but he was wrong ; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry , the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed . 
It had started to rain ; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face , splattering onto his glasses . 
He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan , who was commentating , say , " Slytherin lead , sixty points to zero — " 
The Slytherins'superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs , and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air . 
Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch , let alone catch it . 
" We need time out , " said George , trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time . 
Wood had obviously got the message . 
Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry , Fred , and George dived for the ground , still trying to avoid the mad Bludger . 
" What's going on ? " said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together , while Slytherins in the crowd jeered . 
" Someone's fixed it — it won't leave Harry alone . 
The Slytherins must have done something to it . " 
" But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice , and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . 
. " said Wood , anxiously . 
Madam Hooch was walking toward them . 
Over her shoulder , Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction . 
" Listen , " said Harry as she came nearer and nearer , " with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve . 
Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one . " 
Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys . 
" Oliver , this is insane , " said Alicia Spinnet angrily . 
Let's ask for an inquiry — " " If we stop now , we ' ll have to forfeit the match ! " said Harry . 
" And we ' re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger ! 
Come on , Oliver , tell them to leave me alone ! " 
" This is all your fault , " George said angrily to Wood . 
" Ready to resume play ? " 
she asked Wood . 
Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face . 
" All right , " he said . 
" Fred , George , you heard Harry — leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own . " 
On Madam Hooch's whistle , Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him . 
Higher and higher Harry climbed ; he looped and swooped , spiraled , zigzagged , and rolled . 
Slightly dizzy , he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open , rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down , avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger . 
He could hear laughter from the crowd ; he knew he must look very stupid , but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could ; he began a kind of roller - coaster ride around the edges of the stadium , squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts , where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood — A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again ; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction . 
" Training for the ballet , Potter ? " yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger , and he fled , the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him ; and then , glaring back at Malfoy in hatred , he saw it — the Golden Snitch . 
It was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear — and Malfoy , busy laughing at Harry , hadn't seen it . 
The Bludger had hit him at last , smashed into his elbow , and Harry felt his arm break . 
Dimly , dazed by the searing pain in his arm , he slid sideways on his rain - drenched broom , one knee still crooked over it , his right arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack , this time aiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way , one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain : get to Malfoy . 
" What the — " he gasped , careening out of Harry's way . 
Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch ; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs , and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground , trying hard not to pass out . 
He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand . 
" Aha , " he said vaguely . 
" We ' ve won . " 
And he fainted . 
He came around , rain falling on his face , still lying on the field , with someone leaning over him . 
He saw a glitter of teeth . 
" Oh , no , not you , " he moaned . 
" Not to worry , Harry . 
" No ! " said Harry . 
" I ' ll keep it like this , thanks . . . 
He tried to sit up , but the pain was terrible . 
" Lie back , Harry , " said Lockhart soothingly . 
It was still putting up a terrific fight . 
" No — don't — " said Harry weakly , but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm . 
A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips . 
He had shut his eyes , his face turned away from his arm , but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly . 
" Ah , " said Lockhart . 
" Yes . 
But the point is , the bones are no longer broken . 
That's the thing to bear in mind . 
Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side . 
He tried to move his fingers . 
Nothing happened . 
Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones . 
" I ' ll be able to , certainly , but it will be painful , " said Madam Pomfrey grimly , throwing Harry a pair of pajamas . 
" You ' ll have to stay the night . . . 
Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas . 
It took a while to stuff the rubbery , boneless arm into a sleeve . 
" If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked . " 
" Anyone can make a mistake , " said Hermione . 
" And it doesn't hurt anymore , does it , Harry ? " " No , " said Harry , getting into bed . 
As he swung himself onto the bed , his arm flapped pointlessly . 
Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain . 
Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele - Gro . 
It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it went down , making him cough and splutter . 
treated , leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water . 
" That was some catch you made . 
Malfoy's face . . . he looked ready to kill . . . 
. " " I want to know how he fixed that Bludger , " said Hermione darkly . 
" We can add that to the list of questions we ' ll ask him when we ' ve taken the Polyjuice Potion , " said Harry , sinking back onto his pillows . 
" I hope it tastes better than this stuff . . . 
. " " If it's got bits of Slytherins in it ? 
You ' ve got to be joking , " said Ron . 
The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment . 
Filthy and soaking wet , the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry . 
" Unbelievable flying , Harry , " said George . 
" I ' ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy . 
Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing . 
They had brought cakes , sweets , and bottles of pumpkin juice ; they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over , shouting , " This boy needs rest , he's got thirty - three bones to regrow ! 
And Harry was left alone , with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm . 
For a second , he thought that was what had woken him . 
Then , with a thrill of horror , he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark . 
" Get off ! " he said loudly , and then , " Dobby ! " 
A single tear was running down his long , pointed nose . 
" Harry Potter came back to school , " he whispered miserably . 
" Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter . 
Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train ? " 
Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge away . 
" What ' re you doing here ? " he said . 
" And how did you know I missed the train ? " 
" It was you ! " he said slowly . 
" Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward " — he showed Harry ten long , bandaged fingers — " but Dobby didn't care , sir , for he thought Harry Potter was safe , and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way ! " 
He was rocking backward and forward , shaking his ugly head . 
" Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts , he let his master's dinner burn ! 
Harry slumped back onto his pillows . 
" You nearly got Ron and me expelled , " he said fiercely . 
Dobby smiled weakly . 
" Dobby is used to death threats , sir . 
Dobby gets them five times a day at home . " 
He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore , looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself . 
" Why d ' you wear that thing , Dobby ? " he asked curiously . 
Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly , " Harry Potter must go home ! 
" What d ' you mean , your Bludger ? 
You made that Bludger try and kill me ? " " Not kill you , sir , never kill you ! " said Dobby , shocked . 
" Dobby wants to save Harry Potter's life ! 
Better sent home , grievously injured , than remain here , sir ! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home ! " " Oh , is that all ? " said Harry angrily . 
" If he knew what he means to us , to the lowly , the enslaved , we dregs of the magical world ! 
Of course , Dobby is still treated like that , sir , " he admitted , drying his face on the pillowcase . 
Harry Potter survived , and the Dark Lord's power was broken , and it was a new dawn , sir , and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end , sir . . . . 
A second later , he crawled back onto the bed , cross - eyed , muttering , " Bad Dobby , very bad Dobby . . 
. " " So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" And — did you say it's been opened before ? 
Tell me , Dobby ! " 
He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the water jug . 
" But I'm not Muggle - born — how can I be in danger from the Chamber ? " " Ah , sir , ask no more , ask no more of poor Dobby , " stammered the elf , his eyes huge in the dark . 
" Dark deeds are planned in this place , but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen — go home , Harry Potter , go home . 
Harry Potter must not meddle in this , sir , ' tis too dangerous — " " Who is it , Dobby ? " 
Harry said , keeping a firm hold on Dobby's wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again . 
" Who's opened it ? 
Who opened it last time ? " 
" Dobby can't , sir , Dobby can't , Dobby mustn't tell ! " squealed the elf . 
" Go home , Harry Potter , go home ! " " I'm not going anywhere ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" One of my best friends is Muggle - born ; she ' ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened — " " Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends ! " moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy . 
" So noble ! 
So valiant ! 
But he must save himself , he must , Harry Potter must not — " Dobby suddenly froze , his bat ears quivering . 
Harry heard it , too . 
There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside . 
" Dobby must go ! " breathed the elf , terrified . 
There was a loud crack , and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air . 
He slumped back into bed , his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer . 
He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue . 
" Get Madam Pomfrey , " whispered Dumbledore , and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight . 
Harry lay quite still , pretending to be asleep . 
" What happened ? " 
Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore , bending over the statue on the bed . 
" There was a bunch of grapes next to him , " said Professor McGonagall . 
Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch . 
Slowly and carefully , he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed . 
It was Colin Creevey . 
His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him , holding his camera . 
" Yes , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" But I shudder to think . . . 
Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip . 
" You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker ? " said Professor McGonagall eagerly . 
Dumbledore didn't answer . 
He opened the back of the camera . 
" Good gracious ! " said Madam Pomfrey . 
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera . 
Harry , three beds away , caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic . 
" Melted , " said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly . 
" All melted . . 
. " " What does this mean , Albus ? " Professor McGonagall asked urgently . 
" It means , " said Dumbledore , " that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again . " 
Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth . 
Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore . 
" But , Albus . . . 
" The question is , how . . . 
And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shadowy face , she didn't understand this any better than he did . 
Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff . 
" When you ' ve finished eating , you may leave . " 
Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower , desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby , but they weren't there . 
" Oh , hello , Harry , " he said . 
Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points ! " " You haven't seen Ron or Hermione , have you ? " said Harry . 
" No , I haven't , " said Percy , his smile fading . 
" I hope Ron's not in another girls ' toilet . . . 
There was a clunk , a splash , and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye peering through the keyhole . 
" Harry ! " she said . 
An old cauldron was perched on the toilet , and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it . 
" We'd ' ve come to meet you , but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion , " Ron explained as Harry , with difficulty , locked the stall again . 
" We ' ve decided this is the safest place to hide it . " 
Harry started to tell them about Colin , but Hermione interrupted . 
" We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling 
Professor Flitwick this morning . 
That's why we decided we'd better get going — " " The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy , the better , " snarled Ron . 
" D ' you know what I think ? 
" Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night . " 
Ron and Hermione looked up , amazed . 
Harry told them everything Dobby had told him — or hadn't told him . 
Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open . 
" The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before ? " 
Hermione said . 
" This settles it , " said Ron in a triumphant voice . 
It's obvious . 
I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school . " 
" Maybe it can make itself invisible , " said Hermione , prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron . 
He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry . 
" So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm . . . 
He shook his head . 
" You know what , Harry ? 
If he doesn't stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you . " 
The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning . 
The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion . 
The first years were now moving around the castle in tight - knit groups , as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone . 
Meanwhile , hidden from the teachers , a roaring trade in talismans , amulets , and other protective devices was sweeping the school . 
Neville Longbottom bought a large , evil - smelling green onion , a pointed purple crystal , and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger ; he was a pureblood , and therefore unlikely to be attacked . 
In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual , collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas . 
The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him . 
Unfortunately , the potion was only half finished . 
They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin , and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores . 
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously . 
" I think I'd better do the actual stealing , " Hermione continued in a matter - of - fact tone . 
So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so . " 
Harry smiled feebly . 
Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye . 
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons . 
Snape prowled through the fumes , making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors ' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively . 
Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny , but he had his mind on more important things . 
He was waiting for Hermione's signal , and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion . 
When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville , Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded . 
Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron , pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket , and gave it a quick prod with his wand . 
The firework began to fizz and sputter . 
Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon ; Goyle blundered around , his hands over his eyes , which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened . 
Through the confusion , Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office . 
" Anyone who has been splashed , come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this — " Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward , his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon . 
As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk , some weighted down with arms like clubs , others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips , Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon , the front of her robes bulging . 
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided , Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework . 
There was a sudden hush . 
Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression . 
" He knew it was me , " Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
" I could tell . " 
Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly . 
" Snape can't prove it was you , " said Ron reassuringly to Harry . 
A week later , Harry , Ron , and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board , reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up . 
Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over , looking excited . 
" They're starting a Dueling Club ! " said Seamus . 
" Could be useful , " he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner . 
" Shall we go ? " 
Harry and Hermione were all for it , so at eight o ' clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall . 
The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it , all carrying their wands and looking excited . 
" Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young — maybe it ' ll be him . " 
Can everyone see me ? Can you all hear me ? 
Excellent ! 
" Now , Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club , to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions — for full details , see my published works . 
" Let me introduce my assistant , Professor Snape , " said Lockhart , flashing a wide smile . 
" He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin . 
Snape's upper lip was curling . 
Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed ; at least , Lockhart did , with much twirling of his hands , whereas Snape jerked his head irritably . 
Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them . 
" On the count of three , we will cast our first spells . 
Neither of us will be aiming to kill , of course . " 
" One — two — three — " Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent ; Snape cried : " Expelliarmus ! " 
There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet : He flew backward off the stage , smashed into the wall , and slid down it to sprawl on the floor . 
Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered . 
" Do you think he's all right ? " 
she squealed through her fingers . 
" Who cares ? " said Harry and Ron together . 
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet . 
His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end . 
" Well , there you have it ! " 
he said , tottering back onto the platform . 
" That was a Disarming Charm — as you see , I ' ve lost my wand — ah , thank you , Miss Brown — yes , an excellent idea to show them that , Professor Snape , but if you don't mind my saying so , it was very obvious what you were about to do . 
If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy — however , I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . 
Possibly Lockhart had noticed , because he said , " Enough demonstrating ! 
I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs . 
Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch - Fletchley , but Snape reached Harry and Ron first . 
Potter — " Harry moved automatically toward Hermione . 
" I don't think so , " said Snape , smiling coldly . 
" Mr. 
Malfoy , come over here . 
Let's see what you make of the famous Potter . 
And you , Miss Granger — you can partner Miss Bulstrode . " 
Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return . 
called Lockhart , back on the platform . 
" And bow ! " Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads , not taking their eyes off each other . 
" Wands at the ready ! " shouted Lockhart . 
" When I count to three , cast your charms to disarm your opponents — only to disarm them — we don't want any accidents — one . . . 
two . . . 
three — " 
Harry swung his wand high , but Malfoy had already started on " two " : His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan . 
He stumbled , but everything still seemed to be working , and wasting no more time , Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted , " Rictusempra ! " 
Harry hung back , with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor , but this was a mistake ; gasping for breath , Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees , choked , " Tarantallegra ! " and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep . 
" Stop ! 
" Finite Incantatem ! " he shouted ; Harry's feet stopped dancing , Malfoy stopped laughing , and they were able to look up . 
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene . 
Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor , panting ; Ron was holding up an ashen - faced Seamus , apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done ; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving ; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain ; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor . 
It was difficult : She was a lot bigger than he was . 
" Dear , dear , " said Lockhart , skittering through the crowd , looking at the aftermath of the duels . 
" Up you go , Macmillan . . . . 
Pinch it hard , it ' ll stop bleeding in a second , Boot — " I think I'd better teach you how to block unfriendly spells , " said Lockhart , standing flustered in the midst of the hall . 
He glanced at Snape , whose black eyes glinted , and looked quickly away . 
Neville's round , pink face went pinker . 
" How about Malfoy and Potter ? " said Snape with a twisted smile . 
" Excellent idea ! " said Lockhart , gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room . 
" Now , Harry , " said Lockhart . 
" When Draco points his wand at you , you do this . " 
He raised his own wand , attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action , and dropped it . 
Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said , " Professor , could you show me that blocking thing again ? " 
" You wish , " said Harry out of the corner of his mouth . 
Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder . 
" Just do what I did , Harry ! " " What , drop my wand ? " 
" Three — two — one — go ! " he shouted . 
Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed , " Serpensortia ! " 
The end of his wand exploded . 
Harry watched , aghast , as a long black snake shot out of it , fell heavily onto the floor between them , and raised itself , ready to strike . 
There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away , clearing the floor . 
" I ' ll get rid of it . . . 
. " " Allow me ! " shouted Lockhart . 
He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang ; the snake , instead of vanishing , flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack . 
All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake , " Leave him alone ! " 
And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor , docile as a thick , black garden hose , its eyes now on Harry . 
Harry felt the fear drain out of him . 
He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now , though how he knew it , he couldn't have explained . 
He looked up at Justin , grinning , expecting to see Justin looking relieved , or puzzled , or even grateful — but certainly not angry and scared . 
" What do you think you ' re playing at ? " he shouted , and before Harry could say anything , Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall . 
Snape stepped forward , waved his wand , and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke . 
Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes . 
" Come on , " said Ron's voice in his ear . 
As they went through the doors , the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something . 
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on , and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room . 
Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said , " You ' re a Parselmouth . 
Why didn't you tell us ? " " I'm a what ? " said Harry . 
" A Parselmouth ! " said Ron . " You can talk to snakes ! " " I know , " said Harry . 
" I mean , that's only the second time I ' ve ever done it . 
I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — that was before I knew I was a wizard — " " A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil ? " Ron repeated faintly . 
" So ? " said Harry . 
" I bet loads of people here can do it . " 
Harry , this is bad . " 
" What's bad ? " said Harry , starting to feel quite angry . 
" What's wrong with everyone ? 
Listen , if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin — " " Oh , that's what you said to it ? " 
" What d ' you mean ? 
You were there — you heard me — " " I heard you speaking Parseltongue , " said Ron . " Snake language . 
" I spoke a different language ? 
But — I didn't realize — how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it ? " 
Ron shook his head . 
" D ' you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head ? " he said . 
" What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt ? " " It matters , " said Hermione , speaking at last in a hushed voice , " because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for . 
That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent . " 
Harry's mouth fell open . 
" You ' ll find that hard to prove , " said Hermione . 
Harry lay awake for hours that night . 
Through a gap in the curtains around his four - poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered . . . 
Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin ? 
He didn't know anything about his father's family , after all . 
It seemed he had to be face - to - face with a snake to do it . 
But I'm in Gryffindor , Harry thought . 
The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood . . . . 
Harry turned over . 
By next morning , however , the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled : Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes , a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else , now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs . Norris and Colin Creevey . 
Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room , while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess . 
" For heaven's sake , Harry , " said Hermione , exasperated , as one of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board . 
" Go and find Justin if it's so important to you . " 
So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole , wondering where Justin might be . 
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick , swirling gray snow at every window . 
Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who , by the sound of it , had turned his friend into a badger . 
Resisting the urge to take a look , Harry walked on by , thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work , and deciding to check the library first . 
A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library , but they didn't seem to be working . 
" So anyway , " a stout boy was saying , " I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory . 
I mean to say , if Potter's marked him down as his next victim , it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while . 
Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton . 
That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's heir on the loose , is it ? " 
" Hannah , " said the stout boy solemnly , " he's a Parselmouth . 
Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard . 
Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes ? 
Enemies of the Heir , Beware . 
Next thing we know , Filch's cat's attacked . 
That first year , Creevey , was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match , taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud . 
I mean to say , he was only a baby when it happened . 
Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him . 
Harry couldn't take anymore . 
Clearing his throat loudly , he stepped out from behind the bookshelves . 
If he hadn't been feeling so angry , he would have found the sight that greeted him funny : Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him , and the color was draining out of Ernie's face . 
" Hello , " said Harry . 
" I'm looking for Justin Finch - Fletchley . " 
The Hufflepuffs ' worst fears had clearly been confirmed . 
They all looked fearfully at Ernie . 
" What do you want with him ? " said Ernie in a quavering voice . 
" I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club , " said Harry . 
Ernie bit his white lips and then , taking a deep breath , said , " We were all there . 
Harry said , his voice shaking with anger . 
" And in case you ' re getting ideas , " he added hastily , " I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's , so — " " I don't care what sort of blood you ' ve got ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" Why would I want to attack Muggle - borns ? " 
" I ' ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with , " said Ernie swiftly . 
" It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them , " said Harry . 
" I'd like to see you try it . " 
He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library , earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince , who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook . 
Harry blundered up the corridor , barely noticing where he was going , he was in such a fury . 
" Oh , hello , Hagrid , " Harry said , looking up . 
" What ' re you doing in here ? " 
" It's nothing , " he said . 
" I'd better get going , Hagrid , it's Transfiguration next and I ' ve got to pick up my books . " 
Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor , which was particularly dark ; the torches had been extinguished by a strong , icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane . 
He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor . 
He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved . 
Justin Finch - Fletchley was lying on the floor , rigid and cold , a look of shock frozen on his face , his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling . 
And that wasn't all . 
Next to him was another figure , the strangest sight Harry had ever seen . 
Harry got to his feet , his breathing fast and shallow , his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs . 
He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies . 
The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side . 
He had to get help . . . . 
" What's Potter up to ? 
Why's Potter lurking — " 
For several long minutes , there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick . 
Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet . 
Professor McGonagall came running , followed by her own class , one of whom still had black - and - white - striped hair . 
No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived , panting , on the scene . 
" Caught in the act ! " 
Ernie yelled , his face stark white , pointing his finger dramatically at Harry . 
" That will do , Macmillan ! " said Professor McGonagall sharply . 
Peeves was bobbing overhead , now grinning wickedly , surveying the scene ; Peeves always loved chaos . 
As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick , examining them , Peeves broke into song : 
" Oh , Potter , you rotter , oh , what have you done , You ' re killing off students , you think it's good fun — " 
Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department , but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick . 
In the end , Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air , which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs . 
This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together . 
" Professor , " said Harry at once , " I swear I didn't — " " This is out of my hands , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall curtly . 
" Lemon drop ! " she said . 
This was evidently a password , because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two . 
Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward , like an escalator . 
As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it , Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them . 
They rose upward in circles , higher and higher , until at last , slightly dizzy , Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead , with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin . 
He knew now where he was being taken . 
This must be where Dumbledore lived . 
They stepped off the stone staircase at the top , and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door . 
Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there , alone . 
Harry looked around . 
One thing was certain : of all the teachers ' offices Harry had visited so far this year , Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting . 
If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school , he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it . 
It was a large and beautiful circular room , full of funny little noises . 
There was also an enormous , claw - footed desk , and , sitting on a shelf behind it , a shabby , tattered wizard's hat — the Sorting Hat . 
Harry hesitated . 
He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls . 
Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again ? 
Just to see . . . 
just to make sure it had put him in the right House — He walked quietly around the desk , lifted the hat from its shelf , and lowered it slowly onto his head . 
Harry stared at the black inside of the hat , waiting . 
Then a small voice said in his ear , " Bee in your bonnet , Harry Potter ? " " Er , yes , " Harry muttered . 
" Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask — " " You ' ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House , " said the hat smartly . 
" Yes . . . 
But I stand by what I said before " — Harry's heart leapt — " you would have done well in Slytherin — " Harry's stomach plummeted . 
He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off . 
" You ' re wrong , " he said aloud to the still and silent hat . 
Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit - looking bird that resembled a half - plucked turkey . 
Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back , making its gagging noise again . 
Harry thought it looked very ill . 
Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it , when the bird burst into flames . 
Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk . 
He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one ; the bird , meanwhile , had become a fireball ; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor . 
The office door opened . 
Dumbledore came in , looking very somber . 
" Professor , " Harry gasped . 
" About time , too , " he said . 
He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face . 
" Fawkes is a phoenix , Harry . 
Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes . 
Watch him . . 
Harry looked down in time to see a tiny , wrinkled , newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes . 
It was quite as ugly as the old one . 
They can carry immensely heavy loads , their tears have healing powers , and they make highly faithful pets . " 
In the shock of Fawkes catching fire , Harry had forgotten what he was there for , but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating , light - blue stare . 
Before Dumbledore could speak another word , however , the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in , a wild look in his eyes , his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand . 
" It wasn ' Harry , Professor Dumbledore ! " said Hagrid urgently . 
" I was talkin'ter him seconds before that kid was found , he never had time , sir — " Dumbledore tried to say something , but Hagrid went ranting on , waving the rooster around in his agitation , sending feathers everywhere . 
" — it can't ' ve bin him , I ' ll swear it in front o ' the Ministry o ' Magic if I have to — " " Hagrid , I — " " — yeh ' ve got the wrong boy , sir , I know Harry never — " " Hagrid ! " said Dumbledore loudly . 
" I do not think that Harry attacked those people . " 
" Right . 
I ' ll wait outside then , Headmaster . " 
And he stomped out looking embarrassed . 
" You don't think it was me , Professor ? " 
Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk . 
" But I still want to talk to you . " 
Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him , the tips of his long fingers together . 
" I must ask you , Harry , whether there is anything you'd like to tell me , " he said gently . 
" Anything at all . " 
Harry didn't know what to say . 
He thought of Malfoy shouting , " You ' ll be next , Mudbloods ! " and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said : " Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign , even in the wizarding world . " 
" No , " said Harry . 
What could possibly do that to a ghost ? 
There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas . 
" At this rate , we ' ll be the only ones left , " Ron told Harry and Hermione . 
" Us , Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle . 
But Harry was glad that most people were leaving . 
He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors , as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison ; tired of all the muttering , pointing , and hissing as he passed . 
Fred and George , however , found all this very funny . 
They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors , shouting , " Make way for the Heir of Slytherin , seriously evil wizard coming through . . . 
" It is not a laughing matter , " he said coldly . 
" Oh , get out of the way , Percy , " said Fred . " Harry's in a hurry . " 
" Yeah , he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant , " said George , chortling . 
" Oh , don't , " she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next , or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met . 
Harry didn't mind ; it made him feel better that Fred and George , at least , thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous . 
" It's because he's bursting to say it's really him , " said Ron knowingly . 
" Not for long , " said Hermione in a satisfied tone . 
At last the term ended , and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle . 
Harry found it peaceful , rather than gloomy , and enjoyed the fact that he , Hermione , and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower , which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone , and practice dueling in private . 
Fred , George , and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs . Weasley . 
Percy , who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior , didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room . 
He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time . 
Christmas morning dawned , cold and white . 
Harry and Ron , the only ones left in their dormitory , were woken very early by Hermione , who burst in , fully dressed and carrying presents for them both . 
" Wake up , " she said loudly , pulling back the curtains at the window . 
" Merry Christmas to you , too , " said Hermione , throwing him his present . 
" I ' ve been up for nearly an hour , adding more lacewings to the potion . 
It's ready . " 
Harry sat up , suddenly wide awake . 
" Are you sure ? " " Positive , " said Hermione , shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four - poster . 
" If we ' re going to do it , I say it should be tonight . " 
At that moment , Hedwig swooped into the room , carrying a very small package in her beak . 
" Hello , " said Harry happily as she landed on his bed . 
" Are you speaking to me again ? " 
They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation , too . 
Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee , which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating ; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons , a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team , and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle - feather quill . 
Harry opened the last present to find a new , hand - knitted sweater from Mrs . Weasley and a large plum cake . 
He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt , thinking about Mr. Weasley's car ( which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow ) , and the bout of rule - breaking he and Ron were planning next . 
The Great Hall looked magnificent . 
Not only were there a dozen frost - covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling , but enchanted snow was falling , warm and dry , from the ceiling . 
Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening . 
" We still need a bit of the people you ' re changing into , " said Hermione matter - of - factly , as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent . 
" I ' ve got it all worked out , " she went on smoothly , ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces . 
She held up two plump chocolate cakes . 
All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them . 
Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other . 
" The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair , " she said sternly . 
" You do want to investigate Malfoy , don't you ? " " Oh , all right , all right , " said Harry . 
" But what about you ? 
Whose hair are you ripping out ? " 
" Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club ? 
And she's gone home for Christmas — so I ' ll just have to tell the Slytherins I ' ve decided to come back . " 
When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again , Ron turned to Harry with a doom - laden expression . 
" Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong ? " 
But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement , stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said . 
They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea , waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table , shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle . 
Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters . 
When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall , Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door . 
For a moment , both of them chewed greedily , looks of triumph on their faces . 
Then , without the smallest change of expression , they both keeled over backward onto the floor . 
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall . 
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops , Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore - 
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron . 
Pulling their robes up over their faces , Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door . 
" Hermione ? " 
They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged , shiny - faced and looking anxious . 
Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling , glutinous potion . 
Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat . 
" Did you get them ? " 
Hermione asked breathlessly . 
Harry showed her Goyle's hair . 
" Good . 
" You ' ll need bigger sizes once you ' re Crabbe and Goyle . " 
The three of them stared into the cauldron . 
" I'm sure I ' ve done everything right , " said Hermione , nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions . 
" It looks like the book says it should . . . 
" Now what ? " Ron whispered . 
" We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs . " 
Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses . 
Then , her hand trembling , she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass . 
The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly . 
A second later , it had turned a sick sort of yellow . 
" Add yours , then , " said Hermione . 
Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one . 
Both glasses hissed and frothed : Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger , Crabbe's a dark , murky brown . 
" Hang on , " said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses . 
" Good thinking , " said Ron , unlocking the door . 
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion , Harry slipped into the middle stall . 
" Ready ? " he called . 
" Ready , " came Ron's and Hermione's voices . 
Immediately , his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes — doubled up , he wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes — next , bringing him gasping to all fours , came a horrible melting feeling , as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax — and before his eyes , his hands began to grow , the fingers thickened , the nails broadened , the knuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small — As suddenly as it had started , everything stopped . 
Harry lay facedown on the stone - cold floor , listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet . 
With difficulty , he kicked off his shoes and stood up . 
So this was what it felt like , being Goyle . 
His large hand trembling , he pulled off his old robes , which were hanging a foot above his ankles , pulled on the spare ones , and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes . 
He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles , low on his forehead . 
Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them — he took them off and called , " Are you two okay ? " 
Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth . 
Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror . 
Harry scratched his ear . 
Ron's door opened . 
They stared at each other . 
Except that he looked pale and shocked , Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe , from the pudding - bowl haircut to the long , gorilla arms . 
" This is unbelievable , " said Ron , approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose . 
" Unbelievable . " 
" We'd better get going , " said Harry , loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist . 
" We ' ve still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is . 
I only hope we can find someone to follow . . 
He banged on Hermione's door . 
" I — I don't think I'm going to come after all . 
You go on without me . " 
" Hermione , we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly , no one's going to know it's you — " " No — really — I don't think I ' ll come . 
You two hurry up , you ' re wasting time — " Harry looked at Ron , bewildered . 
" Hermione , are you okay ? " said Harry through the door . 
" Fine — I'm fine — go on — " Harry looked at his watch . 
Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully , checked that the coast was clear , and set off . " Don't swing your arms like that , " Harry muttered to Ron . " Eh ? " " Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . 
. " " How's this ? " " Yeah , that's better . . . 
They went down the marble staircase . 
All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room , but there was nobody around . 
" Any ideas ? " muttered Harry . 
" The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there , " said Ron , nodding at the entrance to the dungeons . 
The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long , curly hair emerged from the entrance . 
" Our common room ? 
I'm a Ravenclaw . " 
She walked away , looking suspiciously back at them . 
Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness , their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor , feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped . 
" Ha ! " said Ron excitedly . 
" There's one of them now ! " 
It wasn't a Slytherin , it was Percy . 
" What ' re you doing down here ? " said Ron in surprise . 
Percy looked affronted . 
It's Crabbe , isn't it ? " 
" Wh — oh , yeah , " said Ron . " Well , get off to your dormitories , " said Percy sternly . 
" It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days . " 
" I , " said Percy , drawing himself up , " am a prefect . 
Nothing's about to attack me . " 
A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron . 
Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them , and for the first time in his life , Harry was pleased to see him . 
" Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time ? 
I ' ve been looking for you ; I want to show you something really funny . " 
Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy . 
" And what ' re you doing down here , Weasley ? " he sneered . 
Percy looked outraged . 
" You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect ! " he said . 
" I don't like your attitude ! " 
Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him . 
Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time . 
He and Ron hurried after Malfoy , who said as they turned into the next passage , " That Peter Weasley — " " Percy , " Ron corrected him automatically . 
" Whatever , " said Malfoy . 
And I bet I know what he's up to . 
He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single - handed . " 
He gave a short , derisive laugh . 
Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks . 
Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare , damp stone wall . 
" What's the new password again ? " he said to Harry . 
" Er — " said Harry . 
" Oh , yeah — pure - blood ! " said Malfoy , not listening , and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open . 
Malfoy marched through it , and Harry and Ron followed him . 
The Slytherin common room was a long , low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round , greenish lamps were hanging on chains . 
" Wait here , " said Malfoy to Harry and Ron , motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire . 
" I ' ll go and get it — my father's just sent it to me — " Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them , Harry and Ron sat down , doing their best to look at home . 
Malfoy came back a minute later , holding what looked like a newspaper clipping . 
Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock . 
He read the clipping quickly , gave a very forced laugh , and handed it to Harry . 
INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Arthur Weasley , Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office , was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car . 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy , a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year , called today for Mr. Weasley's resignation . 
" Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute , " Mr. Malfoy told our reporter . 
" He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately . " 
" Don't you think it's funny ? " 
" Ha , ha , " said Harry bleakly . 
" Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them , " said Malfoy scornfully . 
" You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods , the way they behave . " 
Ron's — or rather , Crabbe's — face was contorted with fury . 
" What's up with you , Crabbe ? " snapped Malfoy . 
" Stomachache , " Ron grunted . 
" You know , I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet , " he went on thoughtfully . 
" I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up . 
Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place . 
Can I have your autograph ? 
Can I lick your shoes , please , Potter ? ' " 
He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron . 
" What's the matter with you two ? " Far too late , Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh , but Malfoy seemed satisfied ; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake . 
" Saint Potter , the Mudbloods ' friend , " said Malfoy slowly . 
And people think he's Slytherin's heir ! " 
" I could help them . " 
Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual . 
. " " You know I haven't , Goyle , how many times do I have to tell you ? " snapped Malfoy . 
" And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either . 
Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it ' ll look suspicious if I know too much about it . 
But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened , a Mudblood died . 
So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time . . . . 
Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy , Harry shot him a warning look and said , " D ' you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught ? " " Oh , yeah . . . 
whoever it was was expelled , " said Malfoy . 
" They're probably still in Azkaban . " 
" Azkaban ? " said Harry , puzzled . 
" Azkaban — the wizard prison , Goyle , " said Malfoy , looking at him in disbelief . 
He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth , but not to get mixed up in it . 
You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week ? " 
Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern . 
" Yeah . . 
. " said Malfoy . 
So did Harry . 
Ron blushed . 
Even his hair was turning red . 
" Medicine for my stomach , " Ron grunted , and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room , hurled themselves at the stone wall , and dashed up the passage , hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything . 
Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank ; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall , which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle . 
Leaving their shoes outside the closet door , they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
" I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks , but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys'drawing room . " 
Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror . 
He was back to normal . 
He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's stall . 
" Hermione , come out , we ' ve got loads to tell you — " " Go away ! " Hermione squeaked . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other . 
Harry had never seen her looking so happy . 
" It's awful — " They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged , sobbing , her robes pulled up over her head . 
" What's up ? " said Ron uncertainly . 
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink . 
Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long , pointed ears poking through her hair . 
" It's okay , Hermione , " said Harry quickly . 
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom . 
Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks . 
There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays , because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked . 
So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione's bed , to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face . 
Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening . 
When the new term started , they brought her each day's homework . 
Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown . 
" I don't suppose you ' ve got any new leads ? " 
" Nothing , " said Harry gloomily . 
" I was so sure it was Malfoy , " said Ron , for about the hundredth time . 
" What's that ? " asked Harry , pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow . 
Ron looked up at Hermione , disgusted . 
" Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you ' ve ever met , or what ? " Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower . 
Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears . 
" That's Filch , " Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused , out of sight , listening hard . 
" You don't think someone else's been attacked ? " said Ron tensely . 
They stood still , their heads inclined toward Filch's voice , which sounded quite hysterical . 
" — even more work for me ! 
They poked their heads around the corner . 
Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post : They were once again on the spot where Mrs . Norris had been attacked . 
They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about . 
A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor , and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
" Now what's up with her ? " said Ron . " Let's go and see , " said Harry , and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign , ignored it as always , and entered . 
It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet . 
" What's up , Myrtle ? " said Harry . 
" Who's that ? " glugged Myrtle miserably . 
. " " But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you , " said Harry , reasonably . 
" I mean , it'd just go right through you , wouldn't it ? " 
He had said the wrong thing . 
Well , ha , ha , ha ! 
asked Harry . 
" I don't know . . . . 
I was just sitting in the U - bend , thinking about death , and it fell right through the top of my head , " said Myrtle , glaring at them . 
Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing . 
A small , thin book lay there . 
It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom . 
Harry stepped forward to pick it up , but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back . 
" What ? " said Harry . 
" Are you crazy ? " said Ron . " It could be dangerous . " 
" Dangerous ? " said Harry , laughing . 
" Come off it , how could it be dangerous ? " 
" Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated — Dad's told me — there was one that burned your eyes out . 
And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading ! 
You just had to wander around with your nose in it , trying to do everything one - handed . 
And — " " All right , I ' ve got the point , " said Harry . 
The little book lay on the floor , nondescript and soggy . 
Harry saw at once that it was a diary , and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old . 
He opened it eagerly . 
On the first page he could just make out the name " T . 
M . Riddle " in smudged ink . 
" Hang on , " said Ron , who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder . 
" I know that name . . . . 
T . M . Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . " 
" How on earth d ' you know that ? " said Harry in amazement . 
Harry peeled the wet pages apart . 
There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them , not even Auntie Mabel's birthday , or dentist , half - past three . 
" He never wrote in it , " said Harry , disappointed . 
" I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away ? " said Ron curiously . 
Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road , London . 
" He must ' ve been Muggle - born , " said Harry thoughtfully . 
" To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road . . . 
. " " Well , it's not much use to you , " said Ron . 
He dropped his voice . 
Harry , however , pocketed it . 
Hermione left the hospital wing , de - whiskered , tail - less , and furfree , at the beginning of February . 
On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower , Harry showed her T . M . Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it . 
" If it has , it's hiding them very well , " said Ron . " Maybe it's shy . 
" I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it , " said Harry . 
" Could ' ve been anything , " said Ron . " Maybe he got thirty O . W . L . s or saved a teacher from the giant squid . 
But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking . 
" What ? " said Ron , looking from one to the other . 
" Well , the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago , wasn't it ? " he said . 
" That's what Malfoy said . " 
" Yeah . . 
. " said Ron slowly . 
" And this diary is fifty years old , " said Hermione , tapping it excitedly . 
" So ? " " Oh , Ron , wake up , " snapped Hermione . 
" We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago . 
We know T . M . Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . 
But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag . 
" It might be invisible ink ! " she whispered . 
She tapped the diary three times and said , " Aparecium ! " 
Nothing happened . 
Undaunted , Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser . 
She rubbed hard on January first . 
Nothing happened . 
" I'm telling you , there's nothing to find in there , " said Ron . " Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in . " 
Harry couldn't explain , even to himself , why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away . 
The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank , he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages , as though it were a story he wanted to finish . 
And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T . M . Riddle before , it still seemed to mean something to him , almost as though 
Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small , and had halfforgotten . 
But this was absurd . 
Nevertheless , Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle , so next day at break , he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award , accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron , who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime . 
Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet . 
probably top of every class — " " You say that like it's a bad thing , " said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice . 
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again . 
Inside the castle , the mood had grown more hopeful . 
There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick , and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive , meaning that they were fast leaving childhood . 
You ' ll have Mrs . 
It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets , with the school so alert and suspicious . 
Perhaps the monster , whatever it was , was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years . . . . 
He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one , that he had " given himself away " at the Dueling Club . 
Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop . 
Wash away the memories of last term ! 
I won't say any more just now , but I think I know just the thing . . . 
He tapped his nose again and strode off . 
Lockhart's idea of a morale - booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth . 
Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late - running Quidditch practice the night before , and he hurried down to the Great Hall , slightly late . 
The walls were all covered with large , lurid pink flowers . 
Worse still , heart - shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling . 
Harry went over to the Gryffindor table , where Ron was sitting looking sickened , and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles . 
" What's going on ? " 
Harry asked them , sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon . 
Ron pointed to the teachers ' table , apparently too disgusted to speak . 
The teachers on either side of him were looking stony - faced . 
From where he sat , Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek . 
" Happy Valentine's Day ! " Lockhart shouted . 
" And may I thank the forty - six people who have so far sent me cards ! 
Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly - looking dwarfs . 
I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion ! 
Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion ! 
And while you ' re at it , Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I ' ve ever met , the sly old dog ! " Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands . 
" Please , Hermione , tell me you weren't one of the forty - six , " said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson . 
All day long , the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines , to the annoyance of the teachers , and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms , one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry . 
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years , which happened to include Ginny Weasley , Harry tried to escape . 
" Let me go ! " Harry snarled , tugging . 
His books , wand , parchment , and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything . 
Harry scrambled around , trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing , causing something of a holdup in the corridor . 
" What's going on here ? " 
came the cold , drawling voice of Draco Malfoy . 
Losing his head , Harry tried to make a run for it , but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor . 
" Right , " he said , sitting on Harry's ankles . 
" Here is your singing valentine : 
His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad , His hair is as dark as a blackboard . 
Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot . 
Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else , he got up , his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf , as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd , some of whom were crying with mirth . 
" Off you go , off you go , the bell rang five minutes ago , off to class , now , " he said , shooing some of the younger students away . 
" And you , Malfoy — " Harry , glancing over , saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something . 
" Give that back , " said Harry quietly . 
ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary . 
" Hand it over , Malfoy , " said Percy sternly . 
" When I ' ve had a look , " said Malfoy , waving the diary tauntingly at Harry . 
He pulled out his wand and shouted , " Expelliarmus ! " and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart , so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air . 
" Harry ! " said Percy loudly . 
" No magic in the corridors . 
I ' ll have to report this , you know ! " 
Malfoy was looking furious , and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom , he yelled spitefully after her , " I don't think Potter liked your valentine much ! " Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class . 
Snarling , Ron pulled out his wand , too , but Harry pulled him away . 
The diary , however , was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it . 
He tried to point this out to Ron , but Ron was having trouble with his wand again ; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end , and he wasn't much interested in anything else . 
Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night . 
This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing , " His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad " one more time , and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again , and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time . 
Harry sat on his four - poster and flicked through the blank pages , not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it . 
Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet , dipped his quill into it , and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary . 
The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then , as though it was being sucked into the page , vanished . 
Excited , Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote , " My name is Harry Potter . " 
Oozing back out of the page , in his very own ink , came words Harry had never written . 
" Hello , Harry Potter . 
My name is Tom Riddle . 
How did you come by my diary ? " 
" Someone tried to flush it down a toilet . " 
He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply . 
But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read . " 
" What do you mean ? " 
Harry scrawled , blotting the page in his excitement . 
" I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things . 
Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . " 
" I'm at Hogwarts , and horrible stuff's been happening . 
Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets ? " His heart was hammering . 
Riddle's reply came quickly , his writing becoming untidier , as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew . 
" Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets . 
In my day , they told us it was a legend , that it did not exist . 
But this was a lie . 
In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one . 
I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled . 
But the headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth . 
They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut . 
But I knew it could happen again . 
The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned . " 
Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back . 
" It's happening again now . 
There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them . 
Who was it last time ? " 
" I can show you , if you like , " came Riddle's reply . 
I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him . " 
Harry hesitated , his quill suspended over the diary . 
What did Riddle mean ? 
He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory , which was growing dark . 
When he looked back at the diary , he saw fresh words forming . 
" Let me show you . " 
Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters . 
" OK . " 
The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind , stopping halfway through the month of June . 
His hands trembling slightly , he raised the book to press his eye against the little window , and before he knew what was happening , he was tilting forward ; the window was widening , he felt his body leave his bed , and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page , into a whirl of color and shadow . 
He knew immediately where he was . 
This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office — but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk . 
A wizened , fraillooking wizard , bald except for a few wisps of white hair , was reading a letter by candlelight . 
Harry had never seen this man before . 
" I'm sorry , " he said shakily . 
He continued to read , frowning slightly . 
" Sorry I disturbed you . 
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh , stood up , walked past Harry without glancing at him , and went to draw the curtains at his window . 
The sky outside the window was ruby - red ; it seemed to be sunset . 
The wizard went back to the desk , sat down , and twiddled his thumbs , watching the door . 
Harry looked around the office . 
This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it , meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster , not Dumbledore , and he , Harry , was little more than a phantom , completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago . 
There was a knock on the office door . 
" Enter , " said the old wizard in a feeble voice . 
He was much taller than Harry , but he , too , had jet - black hair . 
" Ah , Riddle , " said the headmaster . 
" You wanted to see me , Professor Dippet ? " said Riddle . 
He looked nervous . 
" Sit down , " said Dippet . 
" I ' ve just been reading the letter you sent me . " " Oh , " said Riddle . 
Surely you want to go home for the holidays ? " 
" No , " said Riddle at once . 
" I'd much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that — " 
" Yes , sir , " said Riddle , reddening slightly . 
" You are Muggle - born ? " 
" Half - blood , sir , " said Riddle . 
" Muggle father , witch mother . " 
Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically . 
" The thing is , Tom , " he sighed , " special arrangements might have been made for you , but in the current circumstances . . . 
" Precisely , " said the headmaster . 
" My dear boy , you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends . 
Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little girl . . . . 
As a matter of fact , the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school . 
Riddle's eyes had widened . 
" Riddle , do you mean you know something about these attacks ? " " No , sir , " said Riddle quickly . 
But Harry was sure it was the same sort of " no " that he himself had given Dumbledore . 
" You may go , Tom . . . 
Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room . 
Harry followed him . 
Down the moving spiral staircase they went , emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor . 
Riddle stopped , and so did Harry , watching him . 
Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking . 
He was biting his lip , his forehead furrowed . 
They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall , when a tall wizard with long , sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase . 
" What are you doing , wandering around this late , Tom ? " Harry gaped at the wizard . 
He was none other than a fifty - yearyounger Dumbledore . 
" I had to see the headmaster , sir , " said Riddle . 
" Well , hurry off to bed , " said Dumbledore , giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well . 
" Best not to roam the corridors these days . 
Not since . . 
He sighed heavily , bade Riddle good night , and strode off . 
Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then , moving quickly , headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons , with Harry in hot pursuit . 
But to Harry's disappointment , Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape . 
The torches hadn't been lit , and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed , Harry could only just see him , standing stock - still by the door , watching the passage outside . 
It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour . 
All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door , staring through the crack , waiting like a statue . 
And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present , he heard something move beyond the door . 
Someone was creeping along the passage . 
Riddle , quiet as a shadow , edged through the door and followed , Harry tiptoeing behind him , forgetting that he couldn't be heard . 
For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps , until Riddle stopped suddenly , his head inclined in the direction of new noises . 
Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner . 
Harry stepped out behind him . 
He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door , a very large box next to it . 
" ' Evening , Rubeus , " said Riddle sharply . 
The boy slammed the door shut and stood up . 
" It's all over , " he said . 
" I'm going to have to turn you in , Rubeus . 
But monsters don't make good pets . 
" Come on , Rubeus , " said Riddle , moving yet closer . 
" The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow . 
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered . . . 
roared the boy , his voice echoing in the dark passage . 
" He wouldn ' ! 
He never ! " " Stand aside , " said Riddle , drawing out his wand . 
The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite . 
And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long , piercing scream unheard by anyone — A vast , low - slung , hairy body and a tangle of black legs ; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor - sharp pincers — Riddle raised his wand again , but he was too late . 
The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away , tearing up the corridor and out of sight . 
Riddle scrambled to his feet , looking after it ; he raised his wand , but the huge boy leapt on him , seized his wand , and threw him back down , yelling , " NOOOOOOO ! " 
The scene whirled , the darkness became complete ; Harry felt himself falling and , with a crash , he landed spread - eagled on his four - poster in the Gryffindor dormitory , Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach . 
Before he had had time to regain his breath , the dormitory door opened and Ron came in . 
" There you are , " he said . 
Harry sat up . 
He was sweating and shaking . 
" What's up ? " said Ron , looking at him with concern . 
" It was Hagrid , Ron . 
Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago . " 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN : CORNELIUS FUDGE 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures . 
During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house , and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant , three - headed dog he'd christened " Fluffy . " 
And if , as a boy , Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle , Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it . 
He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long , and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs ; Harry could just imagine the thirteen - year - old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it . 
Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary . 
Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he'd seen , until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long , circular conversations that followed . 
" Riddle might have got the wrong person , " said Hermione . 
" Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . 
Ron asked dully . 
Ron tried a different tack . 
" And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts , " said Harry . 
" I don't blame him for wanting to stay here . . . 
. " " You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley , didn't you , Harry ? " " He was buying a Flesh - Eating Slug Repellent , " said Harry quickly . 
The three of them fell silent . 
After a long pause , Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice . 
" Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all ? " 
Tell us , have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately ? ' " 
In the end , they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack , and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice , they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled . 
Peeves had finally got bored of his " Oh , Potter , you rotter " song , Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day , and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three . 
This made Professor Sprout very happy . 
The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year , a matter that Hermione , at least , took very seriously . 
" I just want to give up Potions , " said Harry . 
" We can't , " said Ron gloomily . 
Dean Thomas , who , like Harry , had grown up with Muggles , ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list , then picking the subjects it landed on . 
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them . 
" Depends where you want to go , Harry , " he said . 
People say Muggle Studies is a soft option , but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non - magical community , particularly if they ' re thinking of working in close contact with them — look at my father , he has to deal with Muggle business all the time . 
My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type , so he went for Care of Magical Creatures . 
Play to your strengths , Harry . " 
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch . 
In the end , he chose the same new subjects as Ron , feeling that if he was lousy at them , at least he'd have someone friendly to help him . 
Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff . 
Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner , so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework . 
However , the training sessions were getting better , or at least drier , and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better . 
At the top of the stairs to the dormitory , he met Neville Longbottom , who was looking frantic . 
" Harry — I don't know who did it — I just found — " Watching Harry fearfully , Neville pushed open the door . 
His cloak lay ripped on the floor . 
The bedclothes had been pulled off his four - poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet , the contents strewn over the mattress . 
Harry walked over to the bed , openmouthed , treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls . 
As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed , Ron , Dean , and Seamus came in . 
" What happened , Harry ? " " No idea , " said Harry . 
But Ron was examining Harry's robes . 
" Someone's been looking for something , " said Ron . " Is there anything missing ? " 
Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk . 
It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn't there . 
" Riddle's diary's gone , " he said in an undertone to Ron . " What ? " 
Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out . 
Hermione looked aghast at the news . 
" But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password — " " Exactly , " said Harry . 
" Perfect Quidditch conditions ! " said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table , loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs . 
Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table , wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes . 
Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery , but Harry didn't like the idea . 
He didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again . 
As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things , another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list . 
let me rip . . . 
tear . . 
He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm . 
" The voice ! " said Harry , looking over his shoulder . 
" I just heard it again — didn't you ? " 
Ron shook his head , wide - eyed . 
Hermione , however , clapped a hand to her forehead . 
" Harry — I think I ' ve just understood something ! 
I ' ve got to go to the library ! " 
And she sprinted away , up the stairs . 
" What does she understand ? " said Harry distractedly , still looking around , trying to tell where the voice had come from . 
" Loads more than I do , " said Ron , shaking his head . 
" But why's she got to go to the library ? " " Because that's what Hermione does , " said Ron , shrugging . 
" When in doubt , go to the library . " 
Harry stood , irresolute , trying to catch the voice again , but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him , talking loudly , exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch . 
" You'd better get moving , " said Ron . " It's nearly eleven — the match — " Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower , collected his Nimbus Two Thousand , and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds , but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice , and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room , his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game . 
Harry's heart dropped like a stone . 
" This match has been canceled , " Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone , addressing the packed stadium . 
" But , Professor ! " he shouted . 
" We ' ve got to play — the Cup — Gryffindor — " Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone : " All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms , where their Heads of Houses will give them further information . 
To Harry's surprise , Professor McGonagall didn't object . 
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled ; others looked worried . 
Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase . 
But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time . 
" This will be a bit of a shock , " said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary . 
another double attack . " 
Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered . 
Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth - year girl with long , curly hair . 
Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room . 
And on the bed next to her was — " Hermione ! " 
Ron groaned . 
" They were found near the library , " said Professor McGonagall . 
It was on the floor next to them . . . 
She was holding up a small , circular mirror . 
Harry and Ron shook their heads , both staring at Hermione . 
" I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower , " said Professor McGonagall heavily . 
" I need to address the students in any case . " 
" All students will return to their House common rooms by six o ' clock in the evening . 
No student is to leave the dormitories after that time . 
You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher . 
No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher . 
All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed . 
There will be no more evening activities . " 
The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence . 
It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught . 
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole , and the Gryffindors began talking immediately . 
" Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe ? 
The Heir of Slytherin , the monster of Slytherin — why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out ? " he roared , to nods and scattered applause . 
He was looking pale and stunned . 
" Percy's in shock , " George told Harry quietly . 
But Harry was only half - listening . 
He didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione , lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone . 
Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed . 
Harry now knew exactly how he had felt . 
" What ' re we going to do ? " said Ron quietly in Harry's ear . 
" We ' ve got to go and talk to him , " said Harry , making up his mind . 
Harry had inherited just one thing from his father : a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak . 
It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it . 
They went to bed at the usual time , waited until Neville , Dean , and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep , then got up , dressed again , and threw the cloak over themselves . 
Harry , who had wandered the castle at night several times before , had never seen it so crowded after sunset . 
They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door . 
" What ' re you two doin ' here ? " 
He nearly extinguished the fire , spilling water from the kettle on it , and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand . 
" Are you okay , Hagrid ? " said Harry . 
" Did you hear about Hermione ? " 
" Oh , I heard , all righ ' , " said Hagrid , a slight break in his voice . 
He poured them both large mugs of boiling water ( he had forgotten to add tea bags ) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door . 
Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks , then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner . 
Hagrid checked that they were hidden , seized his crossbow , and flung open his door once more . 
" Good evening , Hagrid . " 
It was Dumbledore . 
The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression , and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes : a pinstriped suit , a scarlet tie , a long black cloak , and pointed purple boots . 
" That's Dad's boss ! " Ron breathed . 
" Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic ! " 
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up . 
Had to come . 
" I never , " said Hagrid , looking imploringly at Dumbledore . 
" Hagrid's record's against him . 
Ministry's got to do something — the school governors have been in touch — " " Yet again , Cornelius , I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest , " said Dumbledore . 
His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before . 
" Look at it from my point of view , " said Fudge , fidgeting with his bowler . 
" I'm under a lot of pressure . 
Got to be seen to be doing something . 
But I ' ve got to take him . 
Got to . 
" Not a punishment , Hagrid , more a precaution . 
If someone else is caught , you ' ll be let out with a full apology — " 
" Not Azkaban ? " croaked Hagrid . 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut , swathed in a long black traveling cloak , smiling a cold and satisfied smile . 
" Already here , Fudge , " he said approvingly . 
" Good , good . . 
. " " What ' re you doin ' here ? " said Hagrid furiously . 
" I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here . " 
He spoke politely , but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes . 
How many attacks have there been now ? 
At this rate , there ' ll be no Muggle - borns left at Hogwarts , and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school . " 
" The appointment — or suspension — of the headmaster is a matter for the governors , Fudge , " said Mr. Malfoy smoothly . 
" But as all twelve of us have voted — " Hagrid leapt to his feet , his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling . 
" I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that . 
He looked at Lucius Malfoy . 
" If the governors want my removal , Lucius , I shall of course step aside — " " But — " stuttered Fudge . 
" No ! " growled Hagrid . 
Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones . 
" However , " said Dumbledore , speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word , " you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me . 
You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it . " 
For a second , Harry was almost sure Dumbledore's eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron stood hidden . 
" Admirable sentiments , " said Malfoy , bowing . 
He strode to the cabin door , opened it , and bowed Dumbledore out . 
That'd lead ' em right ! 
That's all I'm sayin ' . " 
But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door , he stopped again and said loudly , " An'someone ' ll need ter feed Fang while I'm away . " 
The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak . 
" No Dumbledore . 
They might as well close the school tonight . 
There ' ll be an attack a day with him gone . " 
Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle ; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses . 
But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows , striding the grounds with Fang at his heels , the scene didn't look right to Harry ; no better , in fact , than the inside of the castle , where things were so horribly wrong . 
Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione , but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing . 
With Dumbledore gone , fear had spread as never before , so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows . 
There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense , and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled . 
Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself . 
" I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me . . . . 
But what good were these words ? 
Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help , when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were ? 
Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand — the trouble was , there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow . 
They were hampered , of course , by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors . 
Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy . 
" I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever had . 
Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed . 
Snape swept past Harry , making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron . 
" Sir , " said Malfoy loudly . 
" Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors . 
" Yeah , right , " said Malfoy , smirking . 
" I don't care , I don't need my wand , I'm going to kill him with my bare hands — " " Hurry up , I ' ve got to take you all to Herbology , " barked Snape over the class's heads , and off they marched , with Harry , Ron , and Dean bringing up the rear , Ron still trying to get loose . 
It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses . 
The Herbology class was very subdued ; there were now two missing from their number , Justin and Hermione . 
Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs . 
Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face - to - face with Ernie Macmillan . 
Ernie took a deep breath and said , very formally , " I just want to say , Harry , that I'm sorry I ever suspected you . 
I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger , and I apologize for all the stuff I said . 
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron . 
" Do you think it's Malfoy , Harry ? " Ernie asked . 
" No , " said Harry , so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared . 
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass , moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting . 
Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears . 
What ' re you — " 
" Oh , yeah , " said Ron , trying , and failing , to look pleased . 
" But we can't follow them now — " Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously . 
Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders . 
" Looks like they ' re heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . 
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson . 
Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot . 
" We ' ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again , " Harry told Ron . " We can take Fang with us . 
He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid , he might be some help . " 
" Right , " said Ron , who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers . 
Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again . 
Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him . 
" My dear young man , the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty , " said Lockhart , in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two . 
" Oh , yes he would , " said Ron , even more loudly than Dean . 
Harry muttered . 
But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness , his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good , his confidence that the whole business was now at an end , irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face . 
Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron : Let's do it tonight . 
Ron read the message , swallowed hard , and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione . 
The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days , because from six o ' clock onward the Gryffindors had no where else to go . 
Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner , and spent the evening sitting on it , waiting for the room to clear . 
Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap , and Ginny sat watching them , very subdued in Hermione's usual chair . 
Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose , trying to finish the games quickly , but even so , it was well past midnight when Fred , George , and Ginny finally went to bed . 
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak , throwing it over themselves , and climbing through the portrait hole . 
It was another difficult journey through the castle , dodging all the teachers . 
At last they reached the entrance hall , slid back the lock on the oak front doors , squeezed between them , trying to stop any creaking , and stepped out into the moonlit grounds . 
" ' Course , " said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass , " we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow . 
When Harry pushed the door open , Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them . 
Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table . 
" C ' mon , Fang , we ' re going for a walk , " said Harry , patting his leg , and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them , dashed to the edge of the forest , and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree . 
Harry took out his wand , murmured , " Lumos ! " and a tiny light appeared at the end of it , just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders . 
" Good thinking , " said Ron . " I'd light mine , too , but you know — it'd probably blow up or something . . . 
Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder , pointing at the grass . 
Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees . 
" Okay , " Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst , " I'm ready . 
Let's go . " 
So , with Fang scampering around them , sniffing tree roots and leaves , they entered the forest . 
By the glow of Harry's wand , they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path . 
Then , when the trees had become thicker than ever , so that the stars overhead were no longer visible , and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark , they saw their spider guides leaving the path . 
Harry paused , trying to see where the spiders were going , but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch - black . 
He had never been this deep into the forest before . 
He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here . 
But Hagrid was miles away now , probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban , and he had also said to follow the spiders . 
Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward , crushing Ron's foot , but it was only Fang's nose . 
" What d ' you reckon ? " 
Harry said to Ron , whose eyes he could just make out , reflecting the light from his wand . 
" We ' ve come this far , " said Ron . 
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees . 
Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand . 
More than once , they had to stop , so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight . 
After a while , they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward , though the trees were as thick as ever . 
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great , echoing bark , making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins . 
" What ? " said Ron loudly , looking around into the pitch - dark , and gripping Harry's elbow very hard . 
" Listen . . . 
sounds like something big . . . 
They listened . 
Some distance to their right , the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees . 
" Oh , no , " said Ron . " Oh , no , oh , no , oh — " " Shut up , " said Harry frantically . 
" It ' ll hear you . " 
" Hear me ? " said Ron in an unnaturally high voice . 
" It's already heard Fang ! " 
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood , terrified , waiting . 
There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence . 
" What d ' you think it's doing ? " said Harry . 
" Probably getting ready to pounce , " said Ron . 
" D ' you think it's gone ? " 
Harry whispered . 
" Dunno — " Then , to their right , came a sudden blaze of light , so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes . 
" Harry ! " 
Ron shouted , his voice breaking with relief . 
" Harry , it's our car ! " " What ? " " Come on ! " 
Mr. Weasley's car was standing , empty , in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches , its headlights ablaze . 
" It's been here all the time ! " said Ron delightedly , walking around the car . 
" Look at it . 
The forest's turned it wild . . . 
The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud . 
His breathing slowing down again , Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes . 
" And we thought it was going to attack us ! " said Ron , leaning against the car and patting it . 
" I wondered where it had gone ! " 
Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders , but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights . 
" C ' mon , let's go and find them . " 
Ron didn't speak . 
Harry didn't even have time to turn around . 
There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground , so that he was hanging facedown . 
Struggling , terrified , he heard more clicking , and saw Ron's legs leave the ground , too , heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment , he was being swept away into the dark trees . 
They were moving into the very heart of the forest . 
Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster , whining loudly , but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to ; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing . 
He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches ; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf - strewn ground was now swarming with spiders . 
Craning his neck sideways , he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow , a hollow that had been cleared of trees , so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on . 
Spiders . 
The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty , domed web in the very center of the hollow , while its fellows closed in all around it , clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load . 
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him . 
Ron and Fang thudded down next to him . 
Ron looked exactly like Harry felt . 
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something . 
" Aragog ! " it called . 
" Aragog ! " 
And from the middle of the misty , domed web , a spider the size of a small elephant emerged , very slowly . 
There was gray in the black of his body and legs , and each of the eyes on his ugly , pincered head was milky white . 
He was blind . 
" What is it ? " 
he said , clicking his pincers rapidly . 
" Is it Hagrid ? " said Aragog , moving closer , his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely . 
" Kill them , " clicked Aragog fretfully . 
" I was sleeping . . . 
. " " We're friends of Hagrid's , " Harry shouted . 
His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat . 
Click , click , click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow . 
Aragog paused . 
" Hagrid's in trouble , " said Harry , breathing very fast . 
" That's why we ' ve come . " 
" In trouble ? " said the aged spider , and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers . 
" But why has he sent you ? " 
Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it ; he didn't think his legs would support him . 
So he spoke from the ground , as calmly as he could . 
Aragog clicked his pincers furiously , and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders ; it was like applause , except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear . 
" But that was years ago , " said Aragog fretfully . 
I remember it well . 
They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets . 
They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free . " 
" And you . . . 
" I ! " said Aragog , clicking angrily . 
" I was not born in the castle . 
A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg . 
Hagrid was only a boy , but he cared for me , hidden in a cupboard in the castle , feeding me on scraps from the table . 
Hagrid is my good friend , and a good man . 
When I was discovered , and blamed for the death of a girl , he protected me . 
I have lived here in the forest ever since , where Hagrid still visits me . 
" So you never — never attacked anyone ? " 
" Never , " croaked the old spider . 
The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom . 
I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up . 
Our kind like the dark and the quiet . . . 
. " " But then . . . 
Do you know what did kill that girl ? " said Harry . 
Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go , when I sensed the beast moving about the school . " 
" What is it ? " said Harry urgently . 
" We do not speak of it ! " said Aragog fiercely . 
" We do not name it ! 
I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature , though he asked me , many times . " 
Harry didn't want to press the subject , not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides . 
Aragog seemed to be tired of talking . 
" Go ? " said Aragog slowly . 
" I think not . . . 
Harry spun around . 
Even as he reached for his wand , Harry knew it was no good , there were too many of them , but as he tried to stand , ready to die fighting , a loud , long note sounded , and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow . 
The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open . 
" Get Fang ! " Harry yelled , diving into the front seat ; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him , yelping , into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut — Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him ; the engine roared and they were off , hitting more spiders . 
They sped up the slope , out of the hollow , and they were soon crashing through the forest , branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps , following a path it obviously knew . 
Harry looked sideways at Ron . 
His mouth was still open in the silent scream , but his eyes weren't popping anymore . 
" Are you okay ? " Ron stared straight ahead , unable to speak . 
They smashed their way through the undergrowth , Fang howling loudly in the back seat , and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak . 
After ten noisy , rocky minutes , the trees thinned , and Harry could again see patches of sky . 
They had reached the edge of the forest . 
Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out , and when Harry opened the door , he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house , tail between his legs . 
Harry got out too , and after a minute or so , Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed , still stiff - necked and staring . 
Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view . 
Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak . 
Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket . 
" Follow the spiders , " said Ron weakly , wiping his mouth on his sleeve . 
" I ' ll never forgive Hagrid . 
We're lucky to be alive . " 
" That's exactly Hagrid's problem ! " said Ron , thumping the wall of the cabin . 
A cell in Azkaban ! " 
" What was the point of sending us in there ? 
What have we found out , I'd like to know ? " " That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets , " said Harry , throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk . 
" He was innocent . " 
As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden , then pushed the creaking front doors ajar . 
They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase , holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking . 
At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room , where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash . 
They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory . 
Harry , however , didn't feel very sleepy . 
He sat on the edge of his fourposter , thinking hard about everything Aragog had said . 
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle , he thought , sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other monsters didn't want to name it . 
Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets . 
Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows , watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window . 
Riddle had caught the wrong person , the Heir of Slytherin had got off , and no one could tell whether it was the same person , or a different one , who had opened the Chamber this time . 
There was nobody else to ask . 
Harry lay down , still thinking about what Aragog had said . 
" Ron , " he hissed through the dark , " Ron — " Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's , stared wildly around , and saw Harry . 
Aragog said she was found in a bathroom , " said Harry , ignoring Neville's snuffling snores from the corner . 
What if she's still there ? " 
Ron rubbed his eyes , frowning through the moonlight . 
And then he understood , too . 
" You don't think — not Moaning Myrtle ? " 
All those times we were in that bathroom , and she was just three toilets away , " said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day , " and we could ' ve asked her , and now . . 
Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls ' bathroom , the girls ' bathroom , moreover , right next to the scene of the first attack , was going to be almost impossible . 
But something happened in their first lesson , Transfiguration , that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks . 
" We're still getting exams ? " 
There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped , vanishing one of the legs on his desk . 
Professor 
" The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education , " she said sternly . 
Studying hard ! 
" Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible , " she said . 
Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers . 
Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest . 
Three days before their first exam , Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast . 
" You ' ve caught the Heir of Slytherin ! " squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table . 
When the hubbub had subsided , Professor McGonagall said , " Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last . 
I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who , or what , attacked them . 
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in . 
Ron , however , was looking happier than he'd looked in days . 
" Hermione ' ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up ! 
Just then , Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron . 
She looked tense and nervous , and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap . 
" What's up ? " said Ron , helping himself to more porridge . 
" Spit it out , " said Ron , watching her . 
" What is it ? " said Harry . 
Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly , so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him . 
" Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets ? 
I'm starving , I ' ve only just come off patrol duty . " 
Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table . 
" Percy ! " said Ron angrily . 
" What sort of thing ? " he said , coughing . 
" How do you know ? " said Ron , his eyebrows raised . 
ted me doing something and I , um , I asked her not to mention it to anybody . 
I must say , I did think she'd keep her word . 
" What were you doing , Percy ? " said Ron , grinning . 
Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help , but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up — and to his delight it did , midmorning , when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart . 
Lockhart , who had so often assured them that all danger had passed , only to be proved wrong right away , was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors . 
His hair wasn't as sleek as usual ; it seemed he had been up most of the night , patrolling the fourth floor . 
" That's right , " said Ron , catching on . 
They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them , then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
Weasley ! 
What are you doing ? " 
It was Professor McGonagall , and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines . 
" We were — we were — " Ron stammered . 
" We were going to — to go and see — " " Hermione , " said Harry . 
Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him . 
I quite understand . 
Yes , 
I will inform Professor Binns where you ' ve gone . 
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione . 
It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that she had visitors , and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do . 
But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face . 
It was no easy task . 
Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it . 
Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it , too . 
Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land , there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk , known also as the King of Serpents . 
Spiders flee before the Basilisk , for it is their mortal enemy , and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster , which is fatal to it . 
And beneath this , a single word had been written , in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's . 
" Ron , " he breathed . 
" This is it . 
This is the answer . 
The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk — a giant serpent ! 
It's because I understand Parseltongue . . . 
Harry looked up at the beds around him . 
But no one's died — because no one looked it straight in the eye . 
Justin . . . 
" And Mrs . Norris ? " he whispered eagerly . 
Harry thought hard , picturing the scene on the night of Halloween . 
. " he said slowly . 
He scanned the page in his hand eagerly . 
The more he looked at it , the more it made sense . 
The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened ! 
It all fits ! " " But how's the basilisk been getting around the place ? " said Ron . " A giant snake . . . 
Harry , however , pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page . 
" Pipes , " he said . 
Ron , it's been using the plumbing . 
Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm . 
" The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets ! " he said hoarsely . 
" What if it's a bathroom ? 
What if it's in — " " — Moaning Myrtle's bathroom , " said Harry . 
" This means , " said Harry , " I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school . 
That's how he's been controlling the basilisk . " 
" What ' re we going to do ? " said Ron , whose eyes were flashing . 
" Should we go straight to McGonagall ? " " Let's go to the staffroom , " said Harry , jumping up . 
It's nearly break . " 
It was a large , paneled room full of dark , wooden chairs . 
Harry and Ron paced around it , too excited to sit down . 
" All students to return to their House dormitories at once . 
All teachers return to the staffroom . 
Immediately , please . " 
Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron . " Not another attack ? 
Not now ? " " What ' ll we do ? " said Ron , aghast . 
" Go back to the dormitory ? " 
" No , " said Harry , glancing around . 
There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left , full of the teachers ' cloaks . 
" In here . 
Let's hear what it's all about . 
They hid themselves inside it , listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead , and the staffroom door banging open . 
From between the musty folds of the cloaks , they watched the teachers filtering into the room . 
Then Professor McGonagall arrived . 
" A student has been taken by the monster . 
Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth . 
" The Heir of Slytherin , " said Professor McGonagall , who was very white , " left another message . 
" Which student ? " " Ginny Weasley , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" This is the end of Hogwarts . 
Dumbledore always said . . 
The staffroom door banged open again . 
But it was Lockhart , and he was beaming . 
" So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed ? " 
Snape stepped forward . 
" Just the man , " he said . 
" The very man . 
A girl has been snatched by the monster , Lockhart . 
Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself . 
" That's right , Gilderoy , " chipped in Professor Sprout . 
" Weren't you saying just last night that you ' ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is ? " " I — well , I — " sputtered Lockhart . 
" Yes , didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it ? " 
" D - did I ? I don't recall — " " I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested , " said Snape . 
" I — I really never — you may have misunderstood — " " We ' ll leave it to you , then , Gilderoy , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" V - very well , " he said . 
" I ' ll — I ' ll be in my office , getting — getting ready . " 
And he left the room . 
" Right , " said Professor McGonagall , whose nostrils were flared , 
It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life . 
He , Ron , Fred , and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room , unable to say anything to each other . 
Percy wasn't there . 
Near sunset , Fred and George went up to bed , unable to sit there any longer . 
" She knew something , Harry , " said Ron , speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom . 
" That's why she was taken . 
She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets . 
" I mean , she was a pureblood . 
Harry could see the sun sinking , blood - red , below the skyline . 
This was the worst he had ever felt . 
" Harry , " said Ron . " D ' you think there's any chance at all she's not — you know — " Harry didn't know what to say . 
" D ' you know what ? " said Ron . " I think we should go and see 
Lockhart . 
Tell him what we know . 
He's going to try and get into the Chamber . 
Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do , and because he wanted to be doing something , he agreed . 
The Gryffindors around them were so miserable , and felt so sorry for the Weasleys , that nobody tried to stop them as they got up , crossed the room , and left through the portrait hole . 
Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through it . 
" We think it ' ll help you . " 
Two large trunks stood open on the floor . 
The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk . 
" Are you going somewhere ? " said Harry . 
" Er , well , yes , " said Lockhart , ripping a life - size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up . 
" You can't go now ! 
" You wrote them ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" My dear boy , " said Lockhart , straightening up and frowning at Harry . 
And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin . 
" Harry , Harry , " said Lockhart , shaking his head impatiently , " it's not nearly as simple as that . 
I had to track these people down . 
Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did . 
He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them . 
" Let's see , " he said . 
" I think that's everything . 
Yes . 
He pulled out his wand and turned to them . 
Harry was still pointing his wand at him . 
" What d ' you want me to do ? " said Lockhart weakly . 
" I don't know where the Chamber of Secrets is . 
There's nothing I can do . " 
" You ' re in luck , " said Harry , forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint . 
" We think we know where it is . 
And what's inside it . 
Let's go . " 
They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs , along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall , to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom . 
Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking . 
Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet . 
" What do you want this time ? " 
" To ask you how you died , " said Harry . 
" It happened right in here . 
I died in this very stall . 
I remember it so well . 
The door was locked , and I was crying , and then I heard somebody come in . 
A different language , I think it must have been . 
Anyway , what really got me was that it was a boy speaking . 
" I died . " 
" How ? " said Harry . 
She looked dreamily at Harry . 
I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby , you see . 
" Where exactly did you see the eyes ? " said Harry . 
Harry and Ron hurried over to it . 
And then Harry saw it : Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake . 
" Harry , " said Ron . " Say something . 
Something in Parseltongue . " 
" But — " Harry thought hard . 
" Open up , " he said . 
He looked at Ron , who shook his head . 
" English , " he said . 
Harry looked back at the snake , willing himself to believe it was alive . 
" Open up , " he said . 
Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again . 
" I'm going down there , " he said . 
He couldn't not go , not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber , not if there was even the faintest , slimmest , wildest chance that Ginny might be alive . 
" Me too , " said Ron . 
There was a pause . 
" You can go first , " Ron snarled . 
" Boys , " he said , his voice feeble . 
" Boys , what good will it do ? " 
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand . 
Harry followed quickly . 
And then , just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground , the pipe leveled out , and he shot out of the end with a wet thud , landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in . 
Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe , too . 
" We must be miles under the school , " said Harry , his voice echoing in the black tunnel . 
" Under the lake , probably , " said Ron , squinting around at the dark , slimy walls . 
" Lumos ! " 
Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again . 
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight . 
But the tunnel was quiet as the grave , and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull . 
" Harry — there's something up there — " said Ron hoarsely , grabbing Harry's shoulder . 
Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved , lying right across the tunnel . 
Harry turned back to look at the thing , his heart beating so fast it hurt . 
" Blimey , " said Ron weakly . 
" Get up , " said Ron sharply , pointing his wand at Lockhart . 
Lockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron , knocking him to the ground . 
Harry jumped forward , but too late — Lockhart was straightening up , panting , Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face . 
" I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school , tell them I was too late to save the girl , and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body — say good - bye to your memories ! " 
He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled , " Obliviate ! " 
The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb . 
Harry flung his arms over his head and ran , slipping over the coils of snake skin , out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor . 
" Ron ! " he shouted . 
" Are you okay ? 
Ron ! " " I'm here ! " 
came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall . 
There was a dull thud and a loud " ow ! " 
" What now ? " Ron's voice said , sounding desperate . 
Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling . 
Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours . . . . 
Harry knew there was only one thing to do . 
" Wait there , " he called to Ron . " Wait with Lockhart . 
I ' ll go on . . . . 
If I'm not back in an hour . . 
There was a very pregnant pause . 
" So you can — can get back through . 
And , Harry — " " See you in a bit , " said Harry , trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice . 
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone . 
The tunnel turned and turned again . 
He could guess what he had to do . 
He cleared his throat , and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker . 
" Open , " said Harry , in a low , faint hiss . 
The serpents parted as the wall cracked open , the halves slid smoothly out of sight , and Harry , shaking from head to foot , walked inside . 
He was standing at the end of a very long , dimly lit chamber . 
And where was Ginny ? 
He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns . 
Then , as he drew level with the last pair of pillars , a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view , standing against the back wall . 
Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above : It was ancient and monkeyish , with a long , thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes , where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor . 
" Ginny ! " 
Harry muttered , sprinting to her and dropping to his knees . 
" She won't wake , " said a soft voice . 
Harry jumped and spun around on his knees . 
Harry said desperately . 
" She's not — she's not — ? " " She's still alive , " said Riddle . 
" But only just . " 
Harry stared at him . 
" Are you a ghost ? " 
Harry said uncertainly . 
" A memory , " said Riddle quietly . 
He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes . 
" You ' ve got to help me , Tom , " Harry said , raising Ginny's head again . 
There's a basilisk . . . 
I don't know where it is , but it could be along any moment . . . . 
Harry , sweating , managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor , and bent to pick up his wand again . 
But his wand had gone . 
" Did you see — ? " 
He looked up . 
Riddle was still watching him — twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers . 
" Thanks , " said Harry , stretching out his hand for it . 
He continued to stare at Harry , twirling the wand idly . 
" We ' ve got to go ! 
Harry stared at him . 
" What d ' you mean , I won't be — ? " " I ' ve waited a long time for this , Harry Potter , " said Riddle . 
" For the chance to see you . 
To speak to you . " " Look , " said Harry , losing patience , " I don't think you get it . 
We're in the Chamber of Secrets . 
Harry stared at him . 
" Well , that's an interesting question , " said Riddle pleasantly . 
" What are you talking about ? " said Harry . 
" The diary , " said Riddle . 
All the time he spoke , Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face . 
" But I was patient . 
I wrote back . 
I was sympathetic , I was kind . 
I'm so glad I ' ve got this diary to confide in . . . . 
It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck . 
" If I say it myself , Harry , I ' ve always been able to charm the people I needed . 
" Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets . 
She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls . 
She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods , and the Squib's cat . " " No , " Harry whispered . 
" Yes , " said Riddle , calmly . 
It was very amusing . 
Dear Tom , " he recited , watching Harry's horrified face , " I think I'm losing my memory . 
Dear Tom , I can't remember what I did on the night of Halloween , but a cat was attacked and I ' ve got paint all down my front . 
Dear Tom , Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself . 
I think he suspects me . . . . 
There was another attack today and I don't know where I was . 
Tom , what am I going to do ? 
I think I'm going mad . . . . 
I think I'm the one attacking everyone , Tom ! " Harry's fists were clenched , the nails digging deep into his palms . 
And that's where you came in , Harry . 
Of all the people who could have picked it up , it was you , the very person I was most anxious to meet . . . 
. " " And why did you want to meet me ? " said Harry . 
Anger was coursing through him , and it was an effort to keep his voice steady . 
" Well , you see , Ginny told me all about you , Harry , " said Riddle . 
" I knew I must find out more about you , talk to you , meet you if I could . 
" And you framed him , didn't you ? 
On the one hand , Tom Riddle , poor but brilliant , parentless but so brave , school prefect , model student . . . on the other hand , big , blundering Hagrid , in trouble every other week , trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed , sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls . . . 
but I admit , even I was surprised how well the plan worked . 
It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance . . . 
as though Hagrid had the brains , or the power ! 
. " " I bet Dumbledore saw right through you , " said Harry , his teeth gritted . 
But I wasn't going to waste those long years I'd spent searching for it . 
" Well , you haven't finished it , " said Harry triumphantly . 
Harry stared at him . 
" Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened , it was Ginny who was writing to me , not you . 
She saw you with the diary , you see , and panicked . 
What if you found out how to work it , and I repeated all her secrets to you ? 
But I knew what I must do . 
It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir . 
She struggled and cried and became very boring . 
I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here . 
I knew you'd come . 
I have many questions for you , Harry Potter . " " Like what ? " 
Harry spat , fists still clenched . 
" Why do you care how I escaped ? " said Harry slowly . 
He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air , writing three shimmering words : tom marvolo riddle Then he waved the wand once , and the letters of his name rearranged themselves : i am lord voldemort " You see ? " he whispered . 
I , keep the name of a foul , common Muggle , who abandoned me even before I was born , just because he found out his wife was a witch ? 
No , Harry — I fashioned myself a new name , a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak , when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world ! " 
Harry's brain seemed to have jammed . 
" Not the greatest sorcerer in the world , " said Harry , breathing fast . 
" Sorry to disappoint you and all that , but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore . 
" Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me ! " he hissed . 
" He's not as gone as you might think ! " 
Harry retorted . 
Then , as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs , flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar . 
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared , piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling . 
It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons , which were gripping a ragged bundle . 
" That's a phoenix . . . 
. " said Riddle , staring shrewdly back at it . 
So it was . 
Do you feel brave , Harry Potter ? Do you feel safe now ? " 
Harry didn't answer . 
" To business , Harry , " said Riddle , still smiling broadly . 
And twice I failed to kill you . 
How did you survive ? 
Riddle had the wand . 
but the longer Riddle stood there , the more life was dwindling out of Ginny . . . 
and in the meantime , Harry noticed suddenly , Riddle's outline was becoming clearer , more solid . . . . 
But I know why you couldn't kill me . 
And I ' ve seen the real you , I saw you last year . 
You ' re a wreck . 
You ' re barely alive . 
You ' re in hiding . 
You ' re ugly , you ' re foul — " 
Riddle's face contorted . 
" So . 
Your mother died to save you . 
Yes , that's a powerful countercharm . 
I can see now . . . 
there is nothing special about you , after all . 
I wondered , you see . 
Even you must have noticed . 
Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself . 
That's all I wanted to know . " 
Harry stood , tense , waiting for Riddle to raise his wand . 
But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again . 
" Now , Harry , I'm going to teach you a little lesson . 
Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort , Heir of Salazar Slytherin , against famous Harry Potter , and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . 
Harry , fear spreading up his numb legs , watched Riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin , high above him in the half - darkness . 
Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue , Fawkes swaying on his shoulder . 
Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving . 
Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall , and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes ' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight . 
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber . 
Eyes still tightly shut , Harry began to run blindly sideways , his hands outstretched , feeling his way — Voldemort was laughing — Harry tripped . 
He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — the serpent was barely feet from him , he could hear it coming — There was a loud , explosive spitting sound right above him , and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall . 
His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor . 
The snake's tail thrashed , narrowly missing Harry , and before Harry could shut his eyes , it turned — Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes , both its great , bulbous yellow eyes , had been punctured by the phoenix ; blood was streaming to the floor , and the snake was spitting in agony . 
" NO ! " Harry heard Riddle screaming . 
Harry ducked . 
Something soft hit his face . 
Harry seized it . 
Stars winking in front of his eyes , he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it . 
A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat , its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs . 
He raised the sword in both his hands — The basilisk lunged again , and this time its aim was true — Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth — But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms , he felt a searing pain just above his elbow . 
One long , poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell , twitching , to the floor . 
Harry slid down the wall . 
He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm . 
But he knew it was too late . 
Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes , his vision went foggy . 
" Fawkes , " said Harry thickly . 
" You were fantastic , Fawkes . . . 
He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him . 
Even Dumbledore's bird knows it . 
Do you see what he's doing , Potter ? 
He's crying . " 
Harry blinked . 
" I'm going to sit here and watch you die , Harry Potter . 
I'm in no hurry . " 
Harry felt drowsy . 
" So ends the famous Harry Potter , " said Riddle's distant voice . 
" Alone in the Chamber of Secrets , forsaken by his friends , defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged . 
If this is dying , thought Harry , it's not so bad . 
But was this dying ? 
Instead of going black , the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus . 
Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes , still resting his head on Harry's arm . 
Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at Fawkes ; there was a bang like a gun , and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet . 
. " said Riddle quietly , staring at Harry's arm . 
" Of course . . . 
I forgot . . 
He looked into Harry's face . 
Just you and me , Harry Potter . . . 
you and me . . . 
He raised the wand — Then , in a rush of wings , Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap — the diary . 
For a split second , both Harry and Riddle , wand still raised , stared at it . 
Then , without thinking , without considering , as though he had meant to do it all along , Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book . 
Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents , streaming over Harry's hands , flooding the floor . 
Riddle was writhing and twisting , screaming and flailing and then — He had gone . 
Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence . 
Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary . 
Slowly , he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat , and , with a huge tug , retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth . 
Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber . 
Ginny was stirring . 
As Harry hurried toward her , she sat up . 
Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk , over Harry , in his blood - soaked robes , then to the diary in his hand . 
" Harry — oh , Harry — I tried to tell you at b - breakfast , but I c - couldn't say it in front of Percy — it was me , Harry — but I — I s - swear I d - didn't mean to — R - Riddle made me , he t - took me over — and — how did you kill that — that thing ? 
W - where's Riddle ? 
The last thing I r - remember is him coming out of the diary — " " It's all right , " said Harry , holding up the diary , and showing Ginny the fang hole , " Riddle's finished . 
C ' mon , Ginny , let's get out of here — " " I'm going to be expelled ! " 
Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet . 
" I ' ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B - Bill came and n - now I ' ll have to leave and — w - what ' ll Mum and Dad say ? " Fawkes was waiting for them , hovering in the Chamber entrance . 
Harry urged Ginny forward ; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk , through the echoing gloom , and back into the tunnel . 
" Ron ! " 
Harry yelled , speeding up . 
" Ginny's okay ! 
I ' ve got her ! " 
He heard Ron give a strangled cheer , and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rockfall . 
" Ginny ! " 
Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first . 
" You ' re alive ! 
I don't believe it ! 
What happened ? 
How — what — where did that bird come from ? " 
" He's Dumbledore's , " said Harry , squeezing through himself . 
" But — " " Later , " Harry said shortly . 
" Where's Lockhart ? " 
" He's in a bad way . 
Led by Fawkes , whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness , they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe . 
I told him to come and wait here . 
He's a danger to himself . " 
" Hello , " he said . 
Do you live here ? " 
" No , " said Ron , raising his eyebrows at Harry . 
Harry bent down and looked up the long , dark pipe . 
" Have you thought how we ' re going to get back up this ? " he said to Ron . 
Ron shook his head , but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him , his beady eyes bright in the dark . 
Harry looked uncertainly at him . 
" He looks like he wants you to grab hold . . 
. " said Ron , looking perplexed . 
He turned quickly to the others . 
" We ' ve got to hold on to each other . 
Professor Lockhart — " " He means you , " said Ron sharply to Lockhart . 
" You hold Ginny's other hand — " Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt , Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes , and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers . 
This is just like magic ! " 
The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair , and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride , it was over — all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom , and as Lockhart straightened his hat , the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place . 
Myrtle goggled at them . 
" You ' re alive , " she said blankly to Harry . 
" Oh , well . . . 
" Urgh ! " said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark , deserted corridor outside . 
" Harry ! 
Harry pointed . 
Fawkes was leading the way , glowing gold along the corridor . 
Harry knocked and pushed the door open . 
For a moment there was silence as Harry , Ron , Ginny , and Lockhart stood in the doorway , covered in muck and slime and ( in Harry's case ) blood . 
Then there was a scream . 
" Ginny ! " 
Harry , however , was looking past them . 
Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece , beaming , next to Professor McGonagall , who was taking great , steadying gasps , clutching her chest . 
Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's shoulder , just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs . 
You saved her ! How did you do it ? " 
" I think we'd all like to know that , " said Professor McGonagall weakly . 
Mrs . Weasley let go of Harry , who hesitated for a moment , then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat , the rubyencrusted sword , and what remained of Riddle's diary . 
Then he started telling them everything . 
For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence : He told them about hearing the disembodied voice , how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes ; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest , that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died ; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim , and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom . . . . 
But then he faltered . 
Harry thought in panic . 
Riddle's diary didn't work anymore . . . . 
" W - what's that ? " said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice . 
" YouKnow - Who ? 
En - enchant Ginny ? 
But Ginny's not . . . 
Ginny hasn't been . . . 
has she ? " " It was this diary , " said Harry quickly , picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore . 
Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long , crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages . 
" Brilliant , " he said softly . 
" But , Ginny , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" What's our Ginny got to do with — with — him ? " 
What have I always told you ? 
" I found it inside one of the books Mum got me . 
He strode over to the door and opened it . 
I always find that cheers me up , " he added , twinkling kindly down at her . " You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake . 
" So Hermione's okay ! " said Ron brightly . 
Mrs . Weasley led Ginny out , and Mr. Weasley followed , still looking deeply shaken . 
" You know , Minerva , " Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall , " I think all this merits a good feast . 
Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens ? " 
" Right , " said Professor McGonagall crisply , also moving to the door . 
" I ' ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley , shall I ? " " Certainly , " said Dumbledore . 
She left , and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore . 
" I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules , " said Dumbledore . 
Ron opened his mouth in horror . 
Harry gave a start . 
" Professor Dumbledore , " Ron said quickly , " there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets . 
Professor Lockhart — " " Am I a professor ? " said Lockhart in mild surprise . 
I expect I was hopeless , was I ? " " He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired , " Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore . 
He pointed at Harry . 
" Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary , too ? " Dumbledore said to Ron . " I'd like a few more words with Harry . . . 
Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire . 
" Sit down , Harry , " he said , and Harry sat , feeling unaccountably nervous . 
" First of all , Harry , I want to thank you , " said Dumbledore , eyes twinkling again . 
Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you . " 
" And so you met Tom Riddle , " said Dumbledore thoughtfully . 
" Professor Dumbledore . . . 
Riddle said I'm like him . 
Strange likenesses , he said . . . 
" And what do you think , Harry ? " " I don't think I'm like him ! " said Harry , more loudly than he'd intended . 
" I mean , I'm — I'm in Gryffindor , I'm . . 
" The Sorting Hat told me I'd — I'd have done well in Slytherin . 
Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while . . . 
because I can speak Parseltongue . . . 
Not something he intended to do , I'm sure . . . 
Harry said , thunderstruck . 
" Listen to me , Harry . 
" It only put me in Gryffindor , " said Harry in a defeated voice , " because I asked not to go in Slytherin . . . 
. " " Exactly , " said Dumbledore , beaming once more . 
Harry sat motionless in his chair , stunned . 
" If you want proof , Harry , that you belong in Gryffindor , I suggest you look more closely at this . " Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk , picked up the blood - stained silver sword , and handed it to Harry . 
Dully , Harry turned it over , the rubies blazing in the firelight . 
And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt . 
Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink . 
" What you need , Harry , is some food and sleep . 
I suggest you go down to the feast , while I write to Azkaban — we need our gamekeeper back . 
Dear me , we do seem to run through them , don't we ? " Harry got up and crossed to the door . 
He had just reached for the handle , however , when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall . 
" Good evening , Lucius , " said Dumbledore pleasantly . 
Dobby went scurrying in after him , crouching at the hem of his cloak , a look of abject terror on his face . 
The governors suspended you , but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts . " 
They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all . 
Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place . " 
" So — have you stopped the attacks yet ? " he sneered . 
" Well ? " said Mr. Malfoy sharply . 
" Who is it ? " 
He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center , watching Mr. Malfoy closely . 
Harry , however , was watching Dobby . 
His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry , he kept pointing at the diary , then at Mr. Malfoy , and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist . 
" I see . . 
. " said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore . 
" A clever plan , " said Dumbledore in a level voice , still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye . 
Mr. Malfoy said nothing . 
Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise . . . 
And still , behind his back , Dobby was pointing , first to the diary , then to Lucius Malfoy , then punching himself in the head . 
And Harry suddenly understood . 
He nodded at Dobby , and Dobby backed into a corner , now twisting his ears in punishment . 
" Because you gave it to her , " said Harry . 
" Oh , no one will be able to do that , " said Dumbledore , smiling at Harry . 
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment , and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand . 
" We're going , Dobby ! " 
He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him , he kicked him right through it . 
They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor . 
Harry stood for a moment , thinking hard . 
Then it came to him — " Professor Dumbledore , " he said hurriedly . 
" Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy , please ? " " Certainly , Harry , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" But hurry . 
Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office . 
He could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner . 
Then he ran down the dark corridor . 
He caught up with them at the top of the stairs . 
" Mr. 
" What the — ? " 
Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary , threw it aside , then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry . 
He turned to go . 
" Come , Dobby . 
I said , come . " 
" What did you say ? " " Got a sock , " said Dobby in disbelief . 
" Master threw it , and Dobby caught it , and Dobby — Dobby is free . " 
Lucius Malfoy stood frozen , staring at the elf . 
Then he lunged at Harry . 
But Dobby shouted , " You shall not harm Harry Potter ! " 
There was a loud bang , and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward . 
He got up , his face livid , and pulled out his wand , but Dobby raised a long , threatening finger . 
" You shall go now , " he said fiercely , pointing down at Mr. Malfoy . 
" You shall not touch Harry Potter . 
You shall go now . " 
Lucius Malfoy had no choice . 
With a last , incensed stare at the pair of them , he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight . 
" Harry Potter freed Dobby ! " said the elf shrilly , gazing up at Harry , moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb - like eyes . 
" Harry Potter set Dobby free ! " 
" Least I could do , Dobby , " said Harry , grinning . 
" Just promise never to try and save my life again . " 
Well — " " It was a clue , sir , " said Dobby , his eyes widening , as though this was obvious . 
" Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew ! " he sobbed . 
" Farewell , Harry Potter ! " 
Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts , but never one quite like this . 
You solved it ! " 
or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him , or Hagrid turning up at half past three , cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle , or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running , or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ( " Oh , no ! " said Hermione ) , or Dumbledore announcing that , unfortunately , Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year , owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back . 
Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news . 
" Shame , " said Ron , helping himself to a jam doughnut . 
" He was starting to grow on me . " 
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine . 
Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place . 
Too soon , it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred , George , and Ginny got a compartment to themselves . 
They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays . 
Harry was getting very good at it . 
" Oh , that , " said Ginny , giggling . 
" What ? " " It's that Ravenclaw prefect , Penelope Clearwater , " said Ginny . 
He's been meeting her all over the school in secret . 
He was so upset when she was — you know — attacked . 
You won't tease him , will you ? " 
Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione . 
Call me at the Dursleys ' , okay ? 
I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to . . . 
" Proud ? " said Harry . 
" Are you crazy ? 
All those times I could ' ve died , and I didn't manage it ? 
And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world .
