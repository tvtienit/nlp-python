Harry sprinted up to the boys'dormitories to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk ; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls'dormitories , wearing scarf , gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats . 
" Well , it's cold out there ! " she said defensively , as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently . 
They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak - Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing - then , moving slowly and cautiously , they proceeded down the many staircases , pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of Filch or Mrs . Norris . 
They were lucky ; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick , who was gliding along absent - mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like Weasley is our King . 
They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent , snowy grounds . 
With a great leap of his heart , Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney . 
They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door . 
When Harry raised his fist and knocked three times , a dog started barking frantically inside . 
Harry called through the keyhole . 
" Shoulda known ! " said a gruff voice . 
" Bin home three seconds … out the way , Fang … out the way , yeh dozy dog … " 
The bolt was drawn back , the door creaked open and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap . 
Hermione screamed . 
" I'm sorry ! " Hermione gasped , as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them . 
" I just - oh , Hagrid ! " 
" It's nuthin ' , it's nuthin ' ! " said Hagrid hastily , shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains , but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror . 
Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising . 
There were many cuts on his face and hands , some of them still bleeding , and he was moving gingerly , which made Harry suspect broken ribs . 
It was obvious that he had only just got home ; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door . 
Hagrid himself , twice the size of a normal man , was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it . 
" What happened to you ? " Harry demanded , while Fang danced around them all , trying to lick their faces . 
" I'm tellin ' yeh , I'm fine , " said Hagrid , straightening up and turning to beam at them all , but wincing . 
" Hagrid , you ' ve been attacked ! " said Ron . 
" Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ? " Ron demanded . 
" You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey , Hagrid , " said Hermione anxiously , " some of those cuts look nasty . " 
He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it . 
Underneath was a raw , bloody , green - tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire . 
" You ' re not going to eat that , are you , Hagrid ? " said Ron , leaning in for a closer look . 
" It's s ' posed ter look like that , it's dragon meat , " Hagrid said . 
He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face . 
" So , are you going to tell us what's happened to you ? " Harry asked . 
" Can't , Harry . 
Top secret . 
" Did the giants beat you up , Hagrid ? " asked Hermione quietly . 
Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest . 
" Giants ? " said Hagrid , catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face , " who said anythin ' abou ' giants ? 
" We guessed , " said Hermione apologetically . 
" It was kind of … obvious , " said Ron . 
Harry nodded . 
Hagrid glared at them , then snorted , threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle , which was now whistling . 
But his beard twitched . 
" So you have been to look for giants ? " said Harry , grinning as he sat down at the table . 
Hagrid set tea in front of each of them , sat down , picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face . 
" And you found them ? " said Hermione in a hushed voice . 
" Where are they ? " said Ron . 
" They do , " said Hagrid darkly . 
He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising . 
" Come on , Hagrid , tell us what you ' ve been up to ! " said Ron . " Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the Dementors - " 
Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time ; a large quantity of spit , tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid , with a soft splat , on to the floor . 
" Didn't you know ? " Hermione asked him , wide - eyed . 
" I don ' know anythin'that's bin happenin'since I left . 
" Yeah , I am , they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me , and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me - " 
" - and I had to go to a hearing and everything , but tell us about the giants first . " 
" Tell us about your summer and I ' ll tell you about mine . " 
Harry looked right back , an expression of innocent determination on his face . 
" Oh , all righ ' , " Hagrid said in a resigned voice . 
He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth . 
" Oh , Hagrid , don't , it's not hygien — " Hermione began , but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye . 
He took another fortifying gulp of tea , then said , " Well , we set off righ ' after term ended - " 
Hermione interjected . 
" Yeah , tha's righ ' , " said Hagrid , and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak . 
" Yeah , it was jus ' the pair of us . 
" You knew where you were going ? " 
Harry repeated . 
" Well , Dumbledore knew , an ' he told us , " said Hagrid . 
" Are they hidden ? " 
asked Ron . 
" Is it a secret , where they are ? " 
" Not really " said Hagrid , shaking his shaggy head . 
" It's jus ' that mos ' wizards aren ' bothered where they are ,'s long as it's a good long way away . 
Took us abou ' a month ter get there - " 
" A month ? " said Ron , as though he had never heard o f a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time . 
There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he surveyed Ron ; it was almost pitying . 
" We're bein ' watched , Ron , " he said gruffly . 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" Yeh don ' understand , " said Hagrid . 
" We know about that , " said Harry quickly keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story , " we know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore - " 
" So you couldn't use magic to get there ? " 
asked Ron , looking thunderstruck , " you had to act like Muggles all the way ? " 
" Well , not exactly all the way " said Hagrid cagily . 
" We jus ' had ter be careful , ' cause Olympe an ' me , we stick out a bit — " Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea . 
" Ooooh , Dijon ? " said Hermione excitedly . 
" I ' ve been there on holiday , did you see - ? " 
Ran inter a couple o ' mad trolls on the Polish border an ' I had a sligh'disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk , bu ' apart from tha ' couldn't ' a bin smoother . 
" An'then we reached the place , an ' we started trekkin ' up through the mountains , lookin ' fer signs of ' em … 
Hagrid paused for a long draught of tea . 
" Go on ! " said Harry urgently . 
" How big are they ? " 
asked Ron in a hushed voice . 
" Bout twenty feet , " said Hagrid casually . 
" And how many were there ? " asked Harry . 
" Is that all ? " said Hermione . 
Wizards killed a few , o ' course , bu ' mostly they killed each other , an ' now they ' re dyin ' out faster than ever . 
" So , " said Harry , " you saw them and then what ? " 
We didn'dare sleep . 
" Oh , the Gurg - means the chief . " 
" How could you tell which one was the Gurg ? " asked Ron . 
Hagrid grunted in amusement . 
" No problem , " he said . 
" He was the biggest , the ugliest an'the laziest . 
" And you just walked up to him ? " said Hermione breathlessly . 
" Well … down ter him , where he was lyin ' in the valley . 
They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains , see , beside a mountain lake , an ' Karkus was lyin ' by the lake roarin ' at the others ter feed him an ' his wife . 
Olympe an ' I went down the mountainside - " 
" But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you ? " asked Ron incredulously . 
" What do you give a giant ? " asked Ron eagerly . 
Giants like magic , jus'don ' like us usin ' it against ' em . 
Anyway , that firs'day we gave ' im a branch o ' Gubraithian fire . " 
Hermione said , " Wow ! " 
softly , but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement . 
" Well , anyway , " said Hagrid quickly , intervening before Ron could answer back , " Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore , which isn'somethin ' any wizard could do , an'so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus's feet and says , ' A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore , who sends his respectful greetings . ' " 
" And what did Karkus say ? " asked Harry eagerly . 
" Nothin ' , " said Hagrid . 
" And did he like the present ? " asked Ron . 
" Oh yeah , it went down a storm once they understood what it was , " said Hagrid , turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye . 
So then I said , Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift . " 
" Why couldn't you speak to them that day ? " asked Hermione . 
We ' ll come back tomorrow with another present , an'then we do come back with another present - gives a good impression , see ? 
In any case , giants like Karkus - overload ' em with information an'they ' ll kill yeh jus ' to simplify things . 
So we bowed outta the way an ' went off an ' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an'the followin ' mornin ' we went back an'this time we found Karkus sittin ' up waitin ' fer us lookin ' all eager . " 
" And you talked to him ? " 
" What did he say ? " 
" Not much , " said Hagrid . 
We were hopeful when we left that day . 
Promised ter come back next mornin ' with another present … 
" Bu ' that night it all wen ' wrong . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " said Ron quickly . 
They can ' help themselves , they half kill each other every few weeks . 
The men fight each other an'the women fight each other ; the remnants of the old tribes fight each other , an'that's even without squabbles over food an'the best fires an'sleepin'spots . 
" That night a fight broke out , we saw it from the mouth of our cave , lookin'down on the valley . 
An ' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an ' his head was lyin ' at the bottom o ' the lake . " 
" Karkus's , " said Hagrid heavily . 
" Well , we hadn ' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs ' one , an ' we had a funny feelin ' Golgomath wouldn ' be so keen ter listen to us , bu ' we had ter try . " 
" You went to speak to him ? " asked Ron incredulously . 
" After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head ? " 
" Course we did , " said Hagrid , " we hadn ' gone all that way ter give up after two days ! 
We wen'down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus . 
" I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth . 
He was sitting there wearin ' Karkus's helmet , leerin ' at us as we got nearer . 
He's massive , one o ' the biggest ones there . 
Well , I gave it a go - held out a great roll o'dragon skin - an'said , ' gift fer the Gurg of the giants — ' Nex ' thing I knew , I was hangin ' upside - down in the air by me feet , two of his mates had grabbed me . " 
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth . 
" How did you get out of that ? " asked Harry . 
Hit the two holdin ' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an'they dropped me straightaway - bu ' we were in trouble then , ' cause we'd used magic against ' em , an'that's what giants hate abou ' wizards . 
" Blimey , Hagrid , " said Ron quietly . 
" So , how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days ? " 
asked Hermione . 
" We didn ' leave after three days ! " said Hagrid , looking outraged . 
" But you ' ve just said there was no way you could go back ! " 
" No , " said Hagrid , " I wish he had . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " 
" I mean we soon found out he didn ' object ter all wizards - just us . " 
" Death Eaters ? " said Harry quickly . 
" How d ' you know they were Death Eaters ? " said Ron . 
Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak ? 
Maniac , he is . 
We had ter try an ' persuade some o ' the others , the ones who hadn ' wanted Golgomath as Gurg . " 
" How could you tell which ones they were ? " 
asked Ron . 
" Well , they were the ones bein ' beaten to a pulp , weren'they ? " said Hagrid patiently . 
So we decided we'd go pokin ' round the caves by night an'see if we couldn ' persuade a few o ' them . " 
" You went poking around dark caves looking for giants ? " said Ron , with awed respect in his voice . 
" Well , it wasn'the giants who worried us most , " said Hagrid . 
Dumbledore had told us before we wen ' not ter tangle with ' em if we could avoid it , an'the trouble was they knew we was around —'spect Golgomath told ' em abou ' us . 
At night , when the giants were sleepin ' an ' we wanted ter be creepin ' inter the caves , Macnair an'the other one were sneakin ' round the mountains lookin ' fer us . 
I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin ' out at ' em , " said Hagrid , the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard , " she was rarin'ter attack ' em … she's somethin ' when she's roused , Olympe … fiery , yeh know …'spect it's the French in her … " 
Hagrid gazed misty - eyed into the fire . 
" So , what happened ? 
Did you ever get near any of the other giants ? " 
" What ? 
Yeah , on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin ' in an ' headed back down inter the gully , keepin ' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters . 
" Cave must ' ve been cramped , " said Ron . 
" Wasn ' room ter swing a Kneazle , " said Hagrid . 
" Didn't they attack you when they saw you ? " asked Hermione . 
" Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition , " said Hagrid , " but they was badly hurt , all three o ' them ; Golgomath's lot had beaten ' em unconscious ; they'd woken up an ' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find . 
But Hermione said , " What do you mean ' one point ' , Hagrid ? " 
Hagrid looked at her sadly . 
" Golgomath's lot raided the caves . 
" Nope , " said Hagrid , heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face , " but we did wha ' we meant ter do , we g ave ' em Dumbledore's message an'some o ' them heard it an ' I spect some o ' them ' ll remember it . 
Jus ' maybe , them that don ' want ter stay around Golgomath ' ll move outta the mountains , an'there's gotta be a chance they ' ll remember Dumbledore's friendly to ' em … could be they ' ll come . " 
Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through : Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap . 
" Hagrid ? " said Hermione quietly after a while . 
" Did you … was there any sign of … did you hear anything about your … your … mother while you were there ? " 
Hagrid's unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared . 
" I'm sorry … I … forget it - " 
" Dead , " Hagrid grunted . 
They told me . " 
" Oh … I'm … I'm really sorry " said Hermione in a very small voice . 
Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders . 
" No need , " he said shortly . 
They were silent again . 
Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron , plainly wanting them to speak . 
" But you still haven't explained how you got in this state , Hagrid , " Ron said , gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face . 
" Or why you ' re back so late , " said Harry . 
" Who attacked you ? " said Ron . 
" I haven ' bin attacked ! " said Hagrid emphatically . 
" I - " 
But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door . 
Hermione gasped ; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor ; Fang yelped . 
All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway . 
The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain . 
Harry said quickly ; seizing the Invisibility Cloak , he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well . 
Fang was barking madly at the door . 
Hagrid looked thoroughly confused . 
" Hagrid , hide our mugs ! " 
Hagrid seized Harry and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket . 
Fang was now leaping up at the door ; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open . 
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps . 
Lips pursed , she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face ; she barely reached his navel . 
" So , " she said slowly and loudly , as though speaking to somebody deaf . 
" You ' re Hagrid , are you ? " 
Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room , her bulging eyes rolling in every direction . 
" Get away , " she snapped , waving her handbag at Fang , who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face . 
" Er - I don ' want ter be rude , " said Hagrid , staring at her , " but who the ruddy hell are you ? " 
" My name is Dolores Umbridge . " 
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin . 
Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood , sandwiched between Ron and Hermione . 
" Dolores Umbridge ? " 
Hagrid said , sounding thoroughly confused . 
" I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister , yes , " said Umbridge , now pacing around the cabin , taking in every tiny detail within , from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak . 
" I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher - " 
" Wha's that ? " said Hagrid , frowning . 
" Precisely what I was going to ask , " said Umbridge , pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug . 
So I had ter use this one instead . " 
" I heard voices , " she said quietly . 
" I was talkin'ter Fang , " said Hagrid stoutly . 
" And was he talking back to you ? " 
" There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin , " said Umbridge sleekly . 
Hermione gasped ; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth . 
Luckily , Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes and she did not appear to have heard . 
" Well , I on ' y jus ' got back , " said Hagrid , waving an enormous hand at the haversack . 
" Well , I … I don ' know why that'd be … " said Hagrid , tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where Harry , Ron and Hermione stood , as though asking for help . 
Umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin , looking around carefully . 
She bent and peered under the bed . 
She opened Hagrid's cupboards . 
She passed within two inches of where Harry , Ron and Hermione stood pressed against the wall ; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by . 
After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking , she wheeled round again and said , " What has happened to you ? 
Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face , which in Harrys opinion was a mistake , because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible , not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face . 
" Oh , I … had a bit of an accident , " he said lamely . 
" What sort of accident ? " 
" I - I tripped . " 
" Yeah , tha's right . 
I don ' fly , meself . 
" Where have you been ? " asked Umbridge , cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling . 
" Where ' ve I - ? " 
" Been , yes , " she said . 
" Term started two months ago . 
Where have you been ? " 
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye . 
Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously . 
" I - I ' ve been away for me health , " he said . 
Her eyes traveled over Hagrid's discolored and swollen face ; dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat . 
" I see . " 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid , " bit o ' - o ' fresh air , yeh know - " 
" Yes , as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by , " said Umbridge sweetly . 
The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple , flushed . 
" Mountain scenery ? " said Umbridge swiftly . 
She knows , Harry thought desperately . 
Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out . 
Umbridge looked at him coldly ; his smile faltered . 
Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said , " I shall , of course , be informing the Minister of your late return . " 
" Righ ' , " said Hagrid , nodding . 
" You ought to know , too , that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers . 
So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough . " 
She turned sharply and marched back to the door . 
" You ' re inspectin ' us ? " Hagrid repeated blankly , looking after her . 
" Oh , yes , " said Umbridge softly , looking back at him with her hand on the door handle . 
She left , closing the door behind her with a snap . 
" Not yet , " she breathed in his ear . 
" She might not be gone yet . " 
Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way ; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so . 
" She's goin ' back ter the castle , " he said in a low voice . 
" Oh , don ' you worry abou ' that , I ' ve got a great load o ' lessons planned , " said Hagrid enthusiastically , scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again . 
" Erm … special in what way ? " asked Hermione tentatively . 
" I'm not sayin ' , " said Hagrid happily . 
" Hagrid , you ' ve got to pass Umbridge's inspection , and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after Porlocks , how to tell the difference between Knarls and hedgehogs , stuff like that ! " said Hermione earnestly . 
" But tha's not very interestin ' , Hermione , " said Hagrid . 
I ' ve bin bringin ' ' em on fer years , I reckon I ' ve got the on ' y domestic herd in Britain . " 
" Hagrid … please … " said Hermione , a note of real desperation in her voice . 
" Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore . 
But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one - eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner . 
" Lis ' en , it's bin a long day an ' it's late , " he said , patting Hermione gently on the shoulder , so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud . 
" Oh - sorry - " He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes . 
" I dunno if you got through to him , " said Ron a sho rt while later when , having checked that the coast was clear , they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow , leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went . 
" Then I ' ll go back again tomorrow , " said Hermione determinedly . 
" I ' ll plan his lessons for him if I have to . 
I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not getting rid of Hagrid ! " 
Hermione ploughed her way back to Hagrid's cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning . 
Harry and Ron wanted to go with her , but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again , so they remained grudgingly in the common room , trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside , where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake , tobogganing and , worst of all , bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows . 
" Oy ! " bellowed Ron , finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window , " I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window - OUCH ! " 
He withdrew his head sharply , his face covered in snow . 
" It's Fred and George , " he said bitterly , slamming the window behind him . 
Hermione returned from Hagrid's just before lunch , shivering slightly , her robes damp to the knees . 
" So ? " said Ron , looking up when she entered . 
And then he came stumping out of the Forest - " 
Harry groaned . 
The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack . 
" What's he keeping in there ? 
Did he say ? " he asked . 
" No , " said Hermione miserably . 
" He says he wants them to be a surprise . 
I tried to explain about Umbridge , but he just doesn't get it . 
He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study Knarls than Chimaeras - oh , I don't think he's got a Chimaera , " she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron's faces , " but that's not for lack of trying , from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs . 
I don't know how many times I told him he'd be better off following Grubbly - Plank's plan , I honestly don't think he listened to half of what I said . 
He's in a bit of a funny mood , you know . 
Hagrid's reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students . 
Some , like Fred , George and Lee , roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid's enormous hand ; others , like Parvati and Lavender , exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads . 
Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly - Plank's lessons , and the worst of it was that a very small , unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason : Grubbly - Plank's idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off . 
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry , Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrid's on Tuesday , heavily muffled against the cold . 
Harry was worried , not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them , but also about how the rest of the class , particularly Malfoy and his cronies , would behave if Umbridge was watching them . 
However , the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards Hagrid , who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest . 
He did not present a reassuring sight ; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding . 
Harry could not understand this : had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing ? 
As though to complete the ominous picture , Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder . 
Hagrid called happily to the approaching students , jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him . 
" What prefers the dark ? " 
Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle , a trace of panic in his voice . 
" What did he say prefers the dark - did you hear ? " 
Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now ; he had not been very brave then , either . 
He smiled to himself ; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him . 
" Ready ? " said Hagrid cheerfully , looking around at the class . 
Thought we'd go an'see these creatures in their natural habitat . 
" And you ' re sure they ' re trained , are you ? " said Malfoy , the panic in his voice even more pronounced . 
" Course they ' re trained , " said Hagrid , scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder . 
" So what happened to your face , then ? " demanded Malfoy . 
He turned and strode straight into the Forest . 
Nobody seemed much disposed to follow . 
Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione , who sighed but nodded , and the three of them set off after Hagrid , leading the rest of the class . 
They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground . 
With a grunt , Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground , stepped back and turned to face his class , most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him , peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment . 
He turned , shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd , shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird . 
Nobody laughed : most of them looked too scared to make a sound . 
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again . 
A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming . 
And then , as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest , Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees . 
A pair of blank , white , shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face , neck and then skeletal body of a great , black , winged horse emerged from the darkness . 
It surveyed the class for a few seconds , swishing its long black tail , then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs . 
A great wave of relief broke over Harry . 
He looked eagerly at Ron , but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered , " Why doesn't Hagrid call again ? " 
Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them . 
There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them : a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face ; and Neville , whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail . 
" Oh , an ' here comes another one ! " said Hagrid proudly , as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees , folded its leathery wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat . 
Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses , Harry raised his hand . 
Hagrid nodded at him . 
" Excuse me , " said Malfoy in a sneering voice , " but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing ? " 
For an answer , Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground . 
The whole class stared at it for a few seconds , then several people gasped and Parvati squealed . 
" What's doing it ? " 
" What's eating it ? " 
" Thestrals , " said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft " Oh ! " of comprehension at Harry's shoulder . 
Now , who knows - ? " 
Professor Trelawney told me once - " 
Two more horses came quietly out of the trees , one of them passing very close to Parvati , who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree , saying , " I think I felt something , I think it's near me ! " 
" Don ' worry , it won ' hurt yen , " said Hagrid patiently . 
" Righ ' , now , who can tell me why some o ' yeh can see ' em an'some can't ? " 
Hermione raised her hand . 
" Go on then , " said Hagrid , beaming at her . 
" The only people who can see Thestrals , " she said , " are people who have seen death . " 
" Tha's exactly right , " said Hagrid solemnly , " ten points ter Gryffindor . 
Now , Thestrals - " 
" Hem , hem . " 
Professor Umbridge had arrived . 
She was standing a few feet away from Harry , wearing her green hat and cloak again , her clipboard at the ready . 
Hagrid , who had never heard Umbridge's fake cough before , was gazing in some concern at the closest Thestral , evidently under the impression that it had made the sound . 
" Hem , hem . " 
" Oh , hello ! " Hagrid said , smiling , having located the source of the noise . 
" You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning ? " said Umbridge , in the same loud , slow voice she had used with him earlier , as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow . 
" Oh , yeah , " said Hagrid brightly . 
Well , as you can see - or , I dunno - can you ? 
" What did you say ? " 
Hagrid looked a little confused . 
" Er - Thestrals ! " he said loudly . 
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard : " Has … to … resort … to … crude … sign … language . " 
" Well … anyway … " said Hagrid , turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered , " erm … what was I sayin ' ? " 
" Appears … to … have … poor … short … term … memory , " muttered Umbridge , loudly enough for everyone to hear her . 
Yeah , so , we started off with a male an ' five females . 
This one , " he patted the fir st horse to have appeared , " name o ' Tenebrus , he's my special favorite , firs ' one born here in the Forest - " 
" Are you aware , " Umbridge said loudly , interrupting him , " that the Ministry of Magic has classified Thestrals as'dangerous ' ? " 
Harry's heart sank like a stone , but Hagrid merely chuckled . 
" I mean , a dog ' ll bite if yeh bait it , won ' it - but Thestrals have jus ' got a bad reputation because o ' the death thing - people used ter think they were bad omens , didn'they ? 
Umbridge did not answer ; she finished writing her last note , then looked up at Hagrid and said , again very loudly and slowly , " Please continue teaching as usual . 
I am going to walk , " she mimed walking ( Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter ) " among the students " ( she pointed around at individual members of the class ) " and ask them questions . " 
Hagrid stared at her , clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English . 
Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now . 
" I know what you ' re doing , you awful , twisted , vicious - " 
The few unbruised bits of Hagrid's face flushed , but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy's answer . 
" Assuming they can understand you , of course , " said Malfoy loudly , and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles . 
Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville . 
" You can see the Thestrals , Longbottom , can you ? " she said . 
Neville nodded . 
" My … my grandad , " said Neville . 
" And what do you think of them ? " she said , waving her stubby hand at the horses , who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone . 
" Erm , " said Neville nervously , with a glance at Hagrid . 
" No ! " said Neville , looking upset . 
" No , I'm not scared of them ! " 
" It's quite all right , " said Umbridge , patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile , though it looked more like a leer to Harry . 
" Well , Hagrid , " she turned to look up at him again , speaking once more in that loud , slow voice , " I think I ' ve got enough to be getting along with . 
You will receive " ( she mimed taking something from the air in front of her ) " the results of your inspection " ( she pointed at the clipboard ) " in ten days ' time . " 
She held up ten stubby little fingers , then , her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat , she bustled from their midst , leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter , Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking confused and upset . 
stormed Hermione half an hour later , as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow . 
It's her thing about half - breeds all over again - she's trying to make out Hagrid's some kind of dimwitted troll , just because he had a giantess for a mother - and oh , it's not fair , that really wasn't a bad lesson at all - I mean , all right , if it had been Blast - Ended Skrewts again , but Thestrals are fine - in fact , for Hagrid , they ' re really good ! " 
" Umbridge said they ' re dangerous , " said Ron . 
" Well , it's like Hagrid said , they can look after themselves , " said Hermione impatiently , " and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly - Plank wouldn't usually show them to us before NEWT level , but , well , they are very interesting , aren't they ? 
The way some people can see them and some can't ! 
I wish I could . " 
" Do you ? " 
Harry asked her quietly . 
She looked suddenly horrorstruck . 
" Oh , Harry - I'm sorry - no , of course I don't - that was a really stupid thing to say . " 
" It's okay , " he said quickly , " don't worry " 
" I'm surprised so many people could see them , " said Ron . " Three in a class - " 
" Yeah , Weasley , we were just wondering , " said a malicious voice . 
Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow , Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them . 
" D ' you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you'd be able to see the Quaffle better ? " 
He , Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle , then broke into a chorus of " Weasley is our King " . 
" Ignore them , just ignore them , " intoned Hermione , pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again , so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses . 
December arrived , bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth - years . 
They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle ( " You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it , " said Ron ) , to watch over first - and second - years spending their break - times inside because of the bitter cold ( " And they ' re cheeky little snot - rags , you know , we definitely weren't that rude when we were in first year , " said Ron ) and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch , who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels ( " He's got dung for brains , that one , " said Ron furiously ) . 
They were so busy that Hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three . 
Harry , who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made , bent lower over his History of Magic essay . 
In any case , he did not want to think about Christmas . 
For the first time in his school career , he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts . 
Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation , he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment . 
The only thing he really looked forward to were the D . A . meetings , and they would have to stop over the holidays , as nearly everybody in the D . A . would be spending the time with their families . 
Hermione was going skiing with her parents , something that greatly amused Ron , who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains . 
Ron was going home to The Burrow . 
Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said , in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas : " But you ' re coming too ! 
Hermione rolled her eyes , but Harry's spirits soared : the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful , though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius . 
He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs . Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities . 
Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway , he could not help but think Mrs . Weasley might not want him ; they were so often at loggerheads . 
Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire , and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him , he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house , perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher . 
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D . A . meeting before the holidays andwas very glad he had , because when the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas . 
He could tell the elf had done it , because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling , each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend : HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS ! 
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Love good entered , looking as dreamy as always . 
" Hello , " she said vaguely , looking around at what remained of the decorations . 
" No , " said Harry , " it was Dobby the house - elf . " 
" Mistletoe , " said Luna dreamily , pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head . 
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles were by the arrival of Angelina , Katie and Alicia . 
" Well , " said Angelina dully , pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner , " we ' ve finally replaced you . " 
" Replaced me ? " said Harry blankly . 
" You and Fred and George , " she said impatiently . 
" Who ? " said Harry quickly . 
" Ginny Weasley , " said Katie . 
Harry gaped at her . 
" Yeah , I know , " said Angelina , pulling out her wand and flexing her arm , " but she's pretty good , actually . 
Nothing on you , of course , " she said , throwing him a very dirty look , " but as we can't have you … " 
Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter : did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did ? 
" And what about the Beaters ? " he asked , trying to keep his voice even . 
" Andrew Kirke , " said Alicia without enthusiasm , " and Jack Sloper . 
Neither of them are brilliant , but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up … " 
The arrival of Ron , Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end , and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina's burning , reproachful looks . 
" Okay , " he said , calling them all to order . 
" I thought this evening we should just go over the things we ' ve done so far , because it's the last meeting before the holidays and there's no point starting anything new right before a three - week break - " 
" We're not doing anything new ? " said Zacharias Smith , in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room . 
" If I'd known that , I wouldn't have come . " 
Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach , as though he had missed a step going downstairs . 
" - we can practice in pairs , " said Harry . 
" We ' ll start with the Impediment Jinx , for ten minutes , then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again . " 
The room was soon full of intermittent cries of " Impedimenta ! " 
People froze f or a minute or so , during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work , then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx . 
After a while , when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row , he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others . 
When he passed Cho she beamed at him ; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times . 
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx , they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again . 
Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once ; half the group observed the others for a while , then swapped over . 
True , Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean , at whom he had been aiming , but it was a much closer miss than usual , and everybody else had made enormous progress . 
" When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff - maybe even Patronuses . " 
There was a murmur of excitement . 
The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes ; most people wished Harry a " Happy Christmas " as they went . 
Feeling cheerful , he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away . 
Ron and Hermione left before he did ; he hung back a little , because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a " Merry Christmas " from her . 
" No , you go on , " he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam's apple . 
He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room , tears pouring down her face . 
He didn't know what to do . 
She was simply standing there , crying silently . 
" What's up ? " he said , feebly . 
She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve . 
" I'm - sorry , " she said thickly . 
" I suppose … it's just … learning all this stuff … it just makes me … wonder whether … if he'd known it all … he'd still be alive . " 
Harry's heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel . 
She wanted to talk about Cedric . 
" He did know this stuff , " Harry said heavily . 
" He was really good at it , or he could never have got to the middle of that maze . 
But if Voldemort really wants to kill you , you don't stand a chance . " 
" You survived when you were just a baby , " she said quietly . 
" Yeah , well , " said Harry wearily , moving towards the door , " I dunno why nor does anyone else , so it's nothing to be proud of . " 
" I'm really sorry to get all upset like this … I didn't mean to … " 
She hiccoughed again . 
She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy . 
Harry felt thoroughly miserable . 
He'd have been so pleased with just a " Merry Christmas " . 
" I know it must be horrible for you , " she said , mop ping her eyes on her sleeve again . 
" Me mentioning Cedric , when you saw him die … I suppose you just want to forget about it ? " 
Harry did not say anything to this ; it was quite true , but he felt heartless saying it . 
" You ' re a r - really good teacher , you know , " said Cho , with a watery smile . 
" I ' ve never been able to Stun anything before . " 
" Thanks , " said Harry awkwardly . 
They looked at each other for a long moment . 
Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and , at the same time , a complete inability to move his feet . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" What are Nargles ? " 
" No idea , " said Harry . 
She had moved closer . 
" You'd have to ask Loony . 
Luna , I mean . " 
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh . 
He could have counted the freckles on her nose . 
" I really like you , Harry . " 
He could not think . 
She was much too close . 
He returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire ; nearly everybody else had gone to bed . 
Hermione was writing a very long letter ; she had already filled half a roll of parchment , which was dangling from the edge of the table . 
Ron was lying on the hearthrug , trying to finish his Transfiguration homework . 
" What kept you ? " he asked , as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione's . 
Harry didn't answer . 
He was in a state of shock . 
Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened , but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave . 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " Hermione asked , peering at him over the tip of her quill . 
" What's up ? " said Ron , hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry . 
" What's happened ? " 
Harry didn't quite know how to set about telling them , and still wasn't sure whether he wanted to . 
Just as he had decided not to say anything , Hermione took matters out of his hands . 
" Did she corner you after the meeting ? " 
Numbly surprised , Harry nodded . 
" So - er - what did she want ? " he asked in a mock casual voice . 
" She - " Harry began , rather hoarsely ; he cleared his throat and tried again . 
" Did you kiss ? " asked Hermione briskly . 
Ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug . 
Harry looked from Ron's expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione's slight frown , and nodded . 
" HA ! " 
Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid - looking second - years over beside the window jump . 
A reluctant grin spread over Harry's face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug . 
Hermione gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter . 
" Well ? " Ron said finally , looking up at Harry . 
" How was it ? " 
Harry considered for a moment . 
" Wet , " he said truthfully . 
" Because she was crying , " Harry continued heavily . 
" Oh , " said Ron , his smile fading slightly . 
" Maybe I am . " 
" Of course you ' re not , " said Hermione absently , still scribbling away at her letter . 
" How do you know ? " said Ron very sharply . 
" She does it at mealtimes , in the loos , all over the place . " 
" Ron , " said Hermione in a dignified voice , dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot , " you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet . " 
" What's that supposed to mean ? " said Ron indignantly . 
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face . 
" Don't you understand how Cho's feeling at the moment ? " 
she asked . 
" No , " said Harry and Ron together . 
Hermione sighed and laid down her quill . 
Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry , and she can't work out who she likes best . 
Then she ' ll be feeling guilty , thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all , and she ' ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry . 
And she probably can't work out what her feelings towards Harry are , anyway , because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died , so that's all very mixed up and painful . 
Oh , and she's afraid she's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she's been flying so badly . " 
A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech , then Ron said , " One person can't feel all that at once , they'd explode . " 
" Just because you ' ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have , " said Hermione nastily picking up her quill again . 
" She was the one who started it , " said Harry . 
" I wouldn't ' ve - she just sort of came at me - and next thing she's crying all over me - I didn't know what to do — " 
" You just had to be nice to her , " said Hermione , looking up anxiously . 
" You were , weren't you ? " 
" Are you going to see her again ? " 
" I ' ll have to , won't I ? " said Harry . 
" You know what I mean , " said Hermione impatiently . 
Harry said nothing . 
Hermione's words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities . 
He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho — Hogsmeade , perhaps - and being alone with her for hours at a time . 
" Oh well , " said Hermione distantly , buried in her letter once more , " you ' ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her . " 
" What if he doesn't want to ask her ? " said Ron , who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face . 
" Don't be silly , " said Hermione vaguely , " Harry's liked her for ages , haven't you , Harry ? " 
He did not answer . 
" Who ' re you writing the novel to , anyway ? " 
Ron asked Hermione , trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor . 
Hermione hitched it up out of sight . 
" Viktor . " 
" Krum ? " 
" How many other Viktors do we know ? " 
Ron said nothing , but looked disgruntled . 
They sat in silence for another twenty minutes , Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings - out , Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment , rolling it up carefully and sealing it , and Harry staring into the fire , wishing more than anything that Sirius's head would appear there and give him some advice about girls . 
But the fire merely crackled lower and lower , until the red - hot embers crumbled into ash and , looking around , Harry saw that they were , yet again , the last ones in the common room . 
" Well , night , " said Hermione , yawning widely as she set off up the girls'staircase . 
" What does she see in Krum ? " Ron demanded , as he and Harry climbed the boys'stairs . 
" Well , " said Harry , considering the matter , " I s ' pose he's older , isn't he … and he's an international Quidditch player … " 
" I mean , he's a grouchy git , isn't he ? " 
They pulled off their robes and put on pajamass in silence ; Dean , Seamus and Neville were already asleep . 
Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his four - poster ; instead , he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville's bed . 
" Night , " said Harry . 
Maybe next time … if there was a next time … she'd be a bit happier . 
He ought to have asked her out ; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him … or was she lying in bed , still crying about Cedric ? 
He did not know what to think . 
Hermione's explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand . 
An owl hooted somewhere out in the night . 
Harry dreamed he was back in the D . A . room . 
Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences ; she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she showed up . 
And she pulled out fistfuls of Cards from in side her robes and threw them into the air . 
Then she turned into Hermione , who said , " You did promise her , you know , Harry … I think you'd better give her something else instead … how about your Firebolt ? " 
And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt , because Umbridge had it , and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous , he'd only come to the D . A . room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby's head … 
He was gliding between shining metal bars , across dark , cold stone … he was flat against the floor , sliding along on his belly … it was dark , yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange , vibrant colors … he was turning his head … at first glance the corridor was empty … but no … a man was sitting on the floor ahead , his chin drooping on to his chest , his outline gleaming in the dark … 
Harry put out his tongue … he tasted the man's scent on the air … he was alive but drowsy … sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor … 
Harry longed to bite the man … but he must master the impulse … he had more important work to do … 
But the man was stirring … a silver Cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet ; and Harry saw his vibrant , blurred outline towering above him , saw a wand withdrawn from a belt … he had no choice … he reared high from the floor and struck once , twice , three times , plunging his fangs deeply into the man's flesh , feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws , feeling the warm gush of blood … 
The man was yelling in pain … then he fell silent … he slumped backwards against the wall … blood was splattering on to the floor … 
" Harry ! HARRY ! " 
He opened his eyes . 
Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat ; his bed covers were twisted all around him like a strait - jacket ; he felt as though a white - hot poker were being applied to his forehead . 
" Harry ! " 
Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened . 
There were more figures at the foot of Harry's bed . 
He clutched his head in his hands ; the pain was blinding him … he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress . 
" Should we call someone ? " 
" Harry ! Harry ! " 
He had to tell Ron , it was very important that he tell him … taking great gulps of air , Harry pushed himself up in bed , willing himself not to throw up again , the pain half - blinding him . 
" What ? " said Ron uncomprehendingly . 
" Your dad ! 
He's been bitten , it's serious , there was blood everywhere … " 
" I'm going for help , " said the same scared voice , and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory . 
" Harry , mate , " said Ron uncertainly , " you … you were just dreaming … " 
" No ! " said Harry furiously ; it was crucial that Ron understand . 
" It wasn't a dream … not an ordinary dream … I was there , I saw it … I did it … " 
He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care . 
The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly , though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly . 
He retched again and Ron leapt backwards out of the way . 
" Harry , you ' re not well , " he said shakily . 
" I'm fine ! " 
Harry choked , wiping his mouth on his p yjamas and shaking uncontrollably . 
" There's nothing wrong with me , it's your dad you ' ve got to worry about - we need to find out where he is - he's bleeding like mad - I was - it was a huge snake . " 
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it ; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby . 
Whether one minute passed or ten , Harry did not know ; he simply sat there shaking , feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar … then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard Neville's voice again . 
Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown , her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose . 
" What is it , Potter ? 
Where does it hurt ? " 
He had never been so pleased to see her ; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now , not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions . 
" It's Ron's dad , " he said , sitting up again . 
" He's been attacked by a snake and it's serious , I saw it happen . " 
" What do you mean , you saw it happen ? " said Professor McGonagall , her dark eyebrows contracting . 
" I don't know … I was asleep and then I was there … " 
" You mean you dreamed this ? " 
Mr . Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake , there was a load of blood , he collapsed , someone's got to find out where he is … " 
Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing . 
" I'm not lying and I'm not mad ! " 
Harry told her , his voice rising to a shout . 
" I tell you , I saw it happen ! " 
" I believe you , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall curtly . 
Harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate , but jumped out of bed at once , pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose . 
" Weasley , you ought to come too , " said Professor McGonagall . 
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville , Dean and Seamus , out of the dormitory , down the spiral stairs into the common room , through the portrait hole and off along the Fat Lady's moonlit corridor . 
Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment ; he wanted to run , to yell for Dumbledore ; Mr . Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately , and what if those fangs ( Harry tried hard not to think ' my fangs ' ) had been poisonous ? 
Mrs Norris slunk away into the shadows , and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office . 
" Fizzing Whizzbee , " said Professor McGonagall . 
The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside ; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator . 
The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs ; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin . 
Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room , a positive babble of them . 
It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people . 
Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off . 
The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside . 
The room was in half - darkness ; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did ; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames . 
Behind the door , a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing . 
" Oh , it's you , Professor McGonagall … and … ah . " 
Dumbledore was sitting in a high - backed chair behind his desk ; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him . 
He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt , but seemed wideawake , his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall . 
" Professor Dumbledore , Potter has had a … well , a nightmare , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" It wasn't a nightmare , " said Harry quickly . 
Professor McGonagall looked round at Harry , frowning slightly . 
" I … well , I was asleep … " said Harry and , even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand , he felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him , but examining his own interlocked fingers . 
" But it wasn't an ordinary dream … it was real … I saw it happen … " He took a deep breath , " Ron's dad - Mr . Weasley - has been attacked by a giant snake . " 
The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them , sounding slightly ridiculous , even comic . 
There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling . 
Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore , white - faced and shocked . 
" How did you see this ? " Dumbledore asked quietly , still not looking at Harry . 
" Well … I don't know , " said Harry , rather angrily - what did it matter ? 
" I mean … can you remember — er - where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen ? 
Were you perhaps standing beside the victim , or else looking down on the scene from above ? " 
This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore ; it was almost as though he knew … 
" I was the snake , " he said . 
" I saw it all from the snake's point of view . " 
Nobody else spoke for a moment , then Dumbledore , now looking at Ron who was still wheyfaced , asked in a new and sharper voice , " Is Arthur seriously injured ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry emphatically - why were they all so slow on the uptake , did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side ? 
And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him ? 
But Dumbledore stood up , so quickly it made Harry jump , and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling . 
" Everard ? " he said sharply . 
A sallow - faced wizard with a short black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him , both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps , opened their eyes immediately . 
" You were listening ? " said Dumbledore . 
The wizard nodded ; the witch said , " Naturally . " 
" The man has red hair and glasses , " said Dumbledore . " Everard , you will need to raise the alarm , make sure he is found by the right people - " Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames , but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures ( as usually happened at Hogwarts ) neither reappeared . 
One frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain , the other a handsome leather armchair . 
Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls , though snoring and drooling most convincingly , kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids , and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked . 
" Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts's most celebrated Heads , " Dumbledore said , now sweeping around Harry , Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door . 
As they are free to move between their own portraits , they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere … " 
" But Mr . Weasley could be anywhere ! " said Harry . 
" Please sit down , all three of you , " said Dumbledore , as though Harry had not spoken , " Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes . 
Professor McGonagall , if you could draw up extra chairs . " 
Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it ; three chairs appeared out of thin air , straight - backed and wooden , quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry's hearing . 
Harry sat down , watching Dumbledore over his shoulder . 
Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes's plumed golden head with one finger . 
The phoenix awoke immediately . 
He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright , dark eyes . 
" We will need , " Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird , " a warning . " 
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone . 
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known , carried it over to his desk , sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand . 
Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top . 
After a few seconds , the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air … a serpent's head grew out of the end of it , opening its mouth wide . 
Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story : he looked eagerly at 
Dumbledore for a sign that he was right , but Dumbledore did not look up . 
" Naturally , naturally , " murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself , still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise . 
Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question . 
The smoke serpent , however , split itself instantly into two snakes , both coiling and undulating in the dark air . 
With a look of grim satisfaction , Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand : the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint , became a formless haze and vanished . 
Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes , then , realizing that Harry was watching them , hastily pretend to be sleeping again . 
Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for , but before he could do so , there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right ; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait , panting slightly . 
" Dumbledore ! " 
" What news ? " said Dumbledore at once . 
" I yelled until someone came running , " said the wizard , who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him , " said I'd heard something moving downstairs - they weren't sure whether to believe me but went down to check - you know there are no portraits down there to watch from . 
Anyway , they carried him up a few minutes later . 
He doesn't look good , he's covered in blood , I ran along to Elfrida Cragg's portrait to get a good view as they left - " 
" Thank you , " said Dumbledore . 
He looked round at Professor McGonagall . 
" Minerva , I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children . " 
" Of course … " 
Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door . 
Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron , who was looking terrified . 
" And Dumbledore - what about Molly ? " said Professor McGonagall , pausing at the door . 
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told , not the time , but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members , and with a pang he thought that Mr . Weasley's hand must , even now , be pointing atmortal peril . 
But it was very late . 
Mrs . Weasley was probably asleep , not watching the clock . 
Harry felt cold as he remembered Mrs . Weasley's Boggart turning into Mr . Weasley's lifeless body , his glasses askew , blood running down his face … but Mr . Weasley wasn't going to die … he couldn't … 
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron . 
He raised his wand and murmured , " Portus ! " 
Dumbledore marched over to another portrait , this time of a clever - looking wizard with a pointed beard , who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore's voice when he attempted to rouse him . 
" Phineas . 
Phineas . " 
The subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep ; they were shifting around in their frames , the better to watch what was happening . 
When the clever - looking wizard continued to feign sleep , some of them shouted his name , too . 
" Phineas ! 
Phineas ! 
PHINEAS ! " 
He could not pretend any longer ; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide . 
" I need you to visit your other portrait again , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . " I ' ve got another message . " 
" Visit my other portrait ? " said Phineas in a reedy voice , giving a long , fake yawn ( his eyes traveling around the room and focusing on Harry ) . 
Something about Phineas's voice was familiar to Harry , where had he heard it before ? 
But before he could think , the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest . 
" We are honor - bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts ! " cried a fraillooking old wizard whom Harry recognized as Dumbledore's predecessor , Armando Dippet . 
" Shame on you , Phineas ! " 
" Shall I persuade him , Dumbledore ? " called a gimlet - eyed witch , raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod . 
" Oh , very well , " said the wizard called Phineas , eyeing the wand with mild apprehension , " though he may well have destroyed my picture by now , he's done away with most of the family - " 
" Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait , " said Dumbledore , and Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas's voice before : issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place . 
" You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife , children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly . 
Do you understand ? " 
" Arthur Weasley , injured , wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay , " repeated Phineas in a bored voice . 
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again . 
Fred , George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall , all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked , still in their night things . 
" Harry - what's going on ? " asked Ginny , who looked frightened . 
" Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt - " 
" Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix , " said Dumbledore , before Harry could speak . 
I am sending you back to Sirius's house , which is much more convenient for the hospital than The Burrow . 
You will meet your mother there . " 
" How ' re we going ? " asked Fred , looking shaken . 
" Floo powder ? " 
" No , " said Dumbledore , " Floo powder is not safe at the moment , the Network is being watched . 
" We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back … I want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you - " 
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office , leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor . 
" It is Fawkes's warning , " said Dumbledore , catching the feather as it fell . 
" He says he ' ll be delighted , " said a bored voice behind Dumbledore ; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner . 
" Come here , then , " Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys . 
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore's desk . 
" You have all used a Portkey before ? " asked Dumbledore , and they nodded , each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle . 
" Good . 
It happened in a fraction of a second : in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said " three " , Harry looked up at him - they were very close together - and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry's face . 
At once , Harry's scar burned white - hot , as though the old wound had burst open again - and unbidden , unwanted , but terrifyingly strong , there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt , for that instant , he would like nothing better than to strike - to bite - to sink his fangs into the man before him — 
Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel , the ground vanished from beneath his feet , his hand was glued to the kettle ; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind , the kettle pulling them onwards … until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled , the kettle clattered to the ground , and somewhere close at hand a voice said : 
Is it true their father's dying ? " 
Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around ; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve , Grimmauld Place . 
The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle , which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper . 
Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall , looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth ; Sirius was hurrying towards them all , looking anxious . 
" What's going on ? " he said , stretching out a hand to help Ginny up . 
" Ask Harry , " said Fred . 
" Yeah , I want to hear this for myself , " said George . 
The twins and Ginny were staring at him . 
Kreacher's footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside . 
" It was - " Harry began ; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore . 
" I had a - a kind of – vision . " 
And he told them all that he had seen , though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked , rather than from behind the snake's own eyes . 
When Harry had finished , Fred , George and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment . 
Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not , but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks . 
Well , if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack , he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time . 
" Is Mum here ? " said Fred , turning to Sirius . 
" She probably doesn't even know what's happened yet , " said Sirius . 
" We ' ve got to go to St . Mungo's , " said Ginny urgently . 
" Sirius , can you lend us cloaks or anything ? " 
" Hang on , you can't go tearing off to St . Mungo's ! " said Sirius . 
" Course we can go to St . Mungo's if we want , " said Fred , with a mulish expression . 
" And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know ? " 
" What does that matter ? " said George hotly . 
" It matters because we don't want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away ! " said Sirius angrily . 
" Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information ? " 
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything . 
Ron was still ashen - faced and silent . 
Ginny said , " Somebody else could have told us … we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry . " 
" Listen , your dad's been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened , you could seriously damage the Order's - " 
" We don't care about the dumb Order ! " shouted Fred . 
" Your father knew what he was getting into and he won't thank you for messing things up for the Order ! " said Sirius , equally angry . 
" This is how it is - this is why you ' re not in the Order - you don't understand - there are things worth dying for ! " 
" Easy for you to say , stuck here ! " 
He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred , but when he spoke , it was in a voice of determined calm . 
" I know it's hard , but we ' ve all got to act as though we don't know anything yet . 
We ' ve got to stay put , at least until we hear from your mother , all right ? " 
Fred and George still looked mutinous . 
Ginny , however , took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it . 
Harry looked at Ron , who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug , and they sat down too . 
" That's right , " said Sirius encouragingly , " come on , let's all … let's all have a drink while we ' re waiting . 
He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry , skidded along the table , scattering the debris of Sinus's meal , and stopped neatly in front of the six of them . 
They all drank , and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table . 
Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands . 
His stomach was full of horrible hot , bubbling guilt . 
They would not be here if it were not for him ; they would all still be asleep in bed . 
And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr . Weasley was found , because there was also the in escapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr . Weasley in the first place . 
Don't be stupid , you haven't got fangs , he told himself , trying to keep calm , though the hand on his Butterbeer bottle was shaking , you were lying in bed , you weren't attacking anyone … 
But then , what just happened in Dumbledore's office ? he asked himself . 
I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore , too … 
He put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to , and it slopped over on to the table . 
No one took any notice . 
Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and , as they gave cries of shock , a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table , accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather . 
" That's not Dumbledore's writing - it must be a message from your mother - here - " 
He thrust the letter into George's hand , who ripped it open and read aloud : " Dad is still alive . 
I 
Stay where you are . 
I will send news as soon as I can . 
George looked around the table . 
" Still alive … " he said slowly . 
" But that makes it sound … " 
He did not need to finish the sentence . 
It sounded to Harry , too , as though Mr . Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death . 
Still exceptionally pale , Ron stared at the back of his mothers letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him . 
Fred pulled the parchment out of George's hands and read it for himself , then looked up at Harry , who felt his hand shaking on his Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling . 
If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one , he could not remember it . 
Sirius suggested once , without any real conviction , that they all go to bed , but the Weasleys ' looks of disgust were answer enough . 
They mostly sat in silence around the table , watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax , occasionally raising a bottle to their lips , speaking only to check the time , to wonder aloud what was happening , and to reassure each other that if there was bad news , they would know straightaway , for Mrs . Weasley must long since have arrived at St . Mungo's . 
Fred fell into a doze , his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder . 
Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair , but her eyes were open ; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight . 
Ron was sitting with his head in his hands , whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell . 
Harry and Sirius looked at each other every so often , intruders upon the family grief , waiting … waiting … 
At ten past five in the morning by Ron's watch , the kitchen door swung open and Mrs . Weasley entered the kitchen . 
She was extremely pale , but when they all turned to look at her , Fred , Ron and Harry half rising from their chairs , she gave a wan smile . 
We can all go and see him later . 
Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face . 
George and Ginny got up , walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her . 
Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his Butterbeer in one . 
" Breakfast ! " said Sirius loudly and joyfully , jumping to his feet . 
Kreacher ! 
KREACHER ! " 
But Kreacher did not answer the summons . 
" Oh , forget it , then , " muttered Sirius , counting the people in front of him . 
" So , it's breakfast for - let's see - seven … bacon and eggs , I think , and some tea , and toast - " 
Harry hurried over to the stove to help . 
He did not want to intrude on the Weasleys ' happiness and he dreaded the moment when Mrs . Weasley would ask him to recount his vision . 
However , he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs . Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug . 
" I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for you , Harry , " she said in a muffled voice . 
" They might not have found Arthur for hours , and then it would have been too late , but thanks to you he's alive and Dumbledore's been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was , you ' ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise , look at poor Sturgis … " 
Harry could hardly bear her gratitude , but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night . 
Sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help , and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr . Weasley was in hospital . 
" Oh , Sirius , I'm so grateful … they think he ' ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer … of course , that might mean we ' re here for Christmas . " 
Er - now ? " 
He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed . 
Without preamble , Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had , including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr . Weasley . 
When he paused for breath , Sirius said , " Did you tell Dumbledore this ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry impatiently , " but he didn't tell me what it meant . 
Well , he doesn't tell me anything any more . " 
" I'm sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about , " said Sirius steadily . 
" But that's not all , " said Harry , in a voice only a little above a whisper . 
" Sirius , I … I think I'm going mad . 
Back in Dumbledore's office , just before we took the Portkey … for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake , I felt like one - my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore - Sirius , I wanted to attack him ! " 
He could only see a sliver of Siriuss face ; the rest was in darkness . 
" It must have been the aftermath of the vision , that's all , " said Sirius . 
" It wasn't that , " said Harry , shaking his head , " it was like something rose up inside me , like there's a snake inside me . " 
" You need to sleep , " said Sirius firmly . 
" You ' re going to have breakfast , then go upstairs to bed , and after lunch you can go and see Arthur with the others . 
You ' re in shock , Harry ; you ' re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed , and it's lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died . 
He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry , leaving Harry standing alone in the dark . 
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping . 
He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer , but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes , Harry sat fully clothed , hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead , keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable , determined not to fall into a doze , terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron , or else slithered through the house after one of the others … 
When Ron woke up , Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too . 
Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch , so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St Mungo's . 
Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts . 
When Tonks and Mad - Eye turned up to escort them across London , they greeted them gleefully , laughing at the bowler hat Mad - Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him , truthfully , that Tonks , whose hair was short and bright pink again , would attract far less attention on the Underground . 
Tonks was very interested in Harry's vision of the attack on Mr . Weasley , something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing . 
" No , " said Harry , thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted . 
" No , " said Tonks musingly , " no , I suppose it's not really prophecy you ' re doing , is it ? 
I mean , you ' re not seeing the future , you ' re seeing the present … it's odd , isn't it ? 
Harry didn't answer ; fortunately , they got out at the next stop , a station in the very heart of London , and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks , who was leading the way . 
They all followed her up the escalator , Moody clunking along at the back of the group , his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat , clutching his wand . 
Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream , he asked Mad - Eye where St . Mungo's was hidden . 
" Not far from here , " grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store - lined street packed with Christmas shoppers . 
He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind ; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat . 
Theory was , sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd . " 
He seized Harry's shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets . 
" Here we go , " said Moody a moment later . 
They had arrived outside a large , old - fashioned , red - brick department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd . 
" Right , " said Tonks , beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy . 
They nodded , clustering around her . Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass , looking up at the very ugly dummy , her breath steaming up the glass . 
Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass , with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers . 
Then he reminded himself that dummies couldn't hear anyway . 
Next second , his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger , and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs . Weasley by the elbows , stepped right through the glass and vanished . 
Fred , George and Ron stepped after them . 
Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd ; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of Purge & Dowse Ltd ; nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them . 
" C ' mon , " growled Moody , giving Harry yet another poke in the back , and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water , emerging quite warm and dry on the other side . 
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood . 
They were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs , some looking perfectly normal and perusing out - of - date copies of WitchWeekly , others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests . 
The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside , for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises : a sweaty - faced witch in the center of the front row , who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet , kept letting off a high - pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth ; a grubby - looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and , with each clang , his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady . 
Witches and wizards in lime - green robes were walking up and down the rows , asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge's . 
Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests : a wand and bone , crossed . 
" Are they doctors ? " he asked Ron quietly . 
" Doctors ? " said Ron , looking startled . 
" Over here ! " 
called Mrs . Weasley above the renewed c langing of the warlock in the corner , and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked Enquiries . 
There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled : 
Dilys Derwent 
St . Mungo's Healer 1722 - 
Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 1741 - 
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party closely as though counting them ; when Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink , walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished . 
Meanwhile , at the front of the queue , a young wizard was performing an odd on - the - spot jig and trying , in between yelps of pain , to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk . 
" The shoes don't prevent you reading , do they ? " said the blonde witch , irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk . 
Just like it says on the floor guide . 
Next ! " 
As the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way , the Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide : 
Bites , stings , burns , embedded spines , etc . 
A very old , stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now . 
" I'm here to see Broderick Bode ! " he wheezed . 
" Ward forty - nine , but I'm afraid you ' re wasting your time , " said the witch dismissively . 
Next ! " 
A harassed - looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large , feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit . 
" Fourth floor , " said the witch , in a bored voice , without asking , and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk , holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon . 
" Next ! " 
Mrs . Weasley moved forward to the desk . 
" Hello , " she said , " my husband , Arthur Weasley , was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning , could you tell us - ? " 
" Arthur Weasley ? " said the witch , running her finger down a long list in front of her . 
" Thank you , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" Come on , you lot . " 
They followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond , which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling , looking like giant soapsuds . 
More witches and wizards in lime - green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed ; a foul - smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door , and every now and then they heard distant wailing . 
They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature - Induced Injuries corridor , where the second door on the right bore the words : Dangerous ' Dai Llewellyn Ward : Serious Bites . 
Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten : Healer - in - Charge : Hippocrates Smethwyck . 
Trainee Healer : Augustus Pye . 
Mad - Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall , his magical eye spinning in all directions . 
Harry drew back , too , but Mrs . Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door , saying , " Don't be silly , Harry , Arthur wants to thank you . " 
The ward was small and rather dingy , as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door . 
Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling . 
The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious - looking wizard on the wall , captioned : Urquhart Rackharrow , 1612 — 1697 , Inventor of the Entrailexpelling Curse . 
There were only three patients . 
Mr . Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window . 
Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed . 
He looked up as they walked towards him and , seeing who it was , beamed . 
" Bill just left , Molly , had to get back to work , but he says he ' ll drop in on you later . " 
" How are you , Arthur ? " asked Mrs . Weasley , bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face . 
" Why can't they take them off , Dad ? " asked Fred . 
" Well , I start bleeding like mad every time they try , " said Mr . Weasley cheerfully , reaching across for his wand , which lay on his bedside cabinet , and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all . 
They're sure they ' ll find an antidote , though ; they say they ' ve had much worse cases than mine , and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood - Replenishing Potion every hour . 
But that fellow over there , " he said , dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling . 
" A werewolf ? " 
" It's two weeks till full moon , " Mr . Weasley reminded her quietly . 
" They ' ve been talking to him this morning , the Healers , you know , trying to persuade him he ' ll be able to lead an almost normal life . 
I said to him - didn't mention names , of course - but I said I knew a werewolf personally , very nice man , who finds the condition quite easy to manage . " 
" What did he say ? " asked George . 
" And that woman over there , " he indicated the only other occupied bed , which was right beside the door , " won't tell the Healers what bit her , which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally . 
Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg , very nasty smell when they take off the dressings . " 
" So , you going to tell us what happened , Dad ? " asked Fred , pulling his chair closer to the bed . 
" Well , you already know , don't you ? " said Mr . Weasley , with a significant smile at Harry . 
" It's very simple - I'd had a very long day , dozed off , got sneaked up on and bitten . " 
asked Fred , indicating the newspaper Mr . Weasley had cast aside . 
" No , of course not , " said Mr . Weasley , with a slightly bitter smile , " the Ministry wouldn't want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got — " 
Mrs . Weasley warned him . 
" - got - er - me , " Mr . Weasley said hastily , though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say . 
" That's my business , " said Mr . Weasley , though with a small smile . 
He snatched up the Daily Prophe , shook it open again and said , " I was just reading about Willy Widdershins's arrest when you arrived . 
One of his jinxes backfired , the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in - " 
" When you say you were ' on duty ' , " Fred interrupted in a low voice , " what were you doing ? " 
" You heard your father , " whispered Mrs . Weasley , " we are not discussing this here ! 
Go on about Willy Widdershins , Arthur . " 
" Well , don't ask me how , but he actually got off the toilet charge , " said Mr . Weasley grimly . 
" You were guarding it , weren't you ? " said George quietly . 
" The weapon ? 
" George , be quiet ! " 
snapped Mrs . Weasley . 
" Anyway , " said Mr . Weasley , in a raised voice , " this time Willy's been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I don't think he ' ll be able to worm his way out of it because , according to this article , two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St . Mungo's for emergency bone re - growth and memory modification . 
Just think of it , Muggles in St . Mungo's ! 
And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost . 
You saw it the night he returned , didn't you ? " 
" That's enough , " said Mrs . Weasley crossly . 
" Mad - Eye and Tonks are outside , Arthur , they want to come and see you . 
And you lot can wait outside , " she added to her children and Harry . 
Go on . " 
They trooped back into the corridor . 
Mad - Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them . 
Fred raised his eyebrows . 
" Fine , " he said coolly , rummaging in his pockets , " be like that . 
He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other . 
Fred and George handed them around . 
Harry hesitated to take one . 
" Go on , Harry , take it ! 
If anyone's got the right to eavesdrop on him , it's you . " 
Grinning in spite of himself , Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done . 
" Okay , go ! " Fred whispered . 
At first , Harry could hear nothing , then he jumped as he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him . 
" … they searched the whole area but couldn't find the snake anywhere . 
" I reckon he sent it as a lookout , " growled Moody , " cause he's not had any luck so far , has he ? 
No , I reckon he's trying to get a clearer picture of what he's facing and if Arthur hadn't been there the beast would ' ve had a lot more time to look around . 
So , Potter says he saw it all happen ? " 
" Yes , " said Mrs . Weasley . 
" You know , Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this . " 
" Yeah , well , " said Moody , " there's something funny about the Potter kid , we all know that . " 
" Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning , " whispered Mrs Weasley . 
Obviously , Potter doesn't realize what that means , but if You - Know - Who's possessing him — " 
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own , his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face . 
He looked around at the others . 
Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry's eyes ? 
Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own , wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull . 
He felt dirty , contaminated , as though he were carrying some deadly germ , unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent , clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort … he had not merely seen the snake , he hadbeen the snake , he knew it now … 
I'm the weapon , Harry thought , and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins , chilling him , bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel . 
I'm the one Voldemorts trying to use , that's why they ' ve got guards around me everywhere I go , it's not for my protection , it's for other people's , only it's not working , they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts … I did attack Mr . Weasley last night , it was me . 
Are you feeling sick ? " 
They were all watching him . 
He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance . 
" Harry , dear , are you sure you ' re all right ? " said Mrs . Weasley in a worried voice , as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place . 
" You look ever so pale … are you sure you slept this morning ? 
He nodded ; here was a ready - made excuse not to talk to any of the others , which was precisely what he wanted , so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the troll's - leg umbrella stand , up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom . 
Here , he began to pace up and down , past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty picture frame , his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas . 
How had he become a snake ? 
Perhaps he was an Animagus … no , he couldn't be , he would know … perhapsVoldemort was an Animagus … yes , thought Harry , that would fit , he would turn into a snake of course … and when he's possessing me , then we both transform … that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes … but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world , apart from Dumbledore , it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that . 
And then , with a terrible stab of panic , he thought , but this is insane - if Voldemort's possessing me , I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarter s of the Order of the Phoenix right now ! He ' ll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is … and I ' ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have , everything Sirius told me the first night I was here … 
There was only one thing for it : he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway . 
He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others , which would keep them safe over the holidays at least … but no , that wouldn't do , there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure . 
What if it was Seamus , Dean or Neville next time ? 
He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame . 
A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach . 
He had no alternative : he was going to have to return to Privet Drive , cut himself off from other wizards entirely . 
Well , if he had to do it , he thought , there was no point hanging around . 
Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected , he strode over to his trunk , slammed the lid shut and locked it , then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well , her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said , " Running away , are we ? " 
He looked around . 
Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame , watching Harry with an amused expression on his face . 
" Not running away , no , " said Harry shortly , dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room . 
" I thought , " said Phineas Nigellus , stroking his pointed beard , " that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave ! 
We Slytherins are brave , yes , but not stupid . 
For instance , given the choice , we will always choose to save our own necks . " 
" It's not my own neck I'm saving , " said Harry tersely , tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven , moth - eaten carpet right in front of the door . 
" Oh , I see , " said Phineas Nigellus , still stroking his beard , " this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble . " 
Harry ignored him . 
His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily , " I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore . " 
Harry span round . 
" What is it ? " 
" ' Stay where you are . ' " 
" I haven't moved ! " said Harry , his hand still upon the doorknob . 
" So what's the message ? " 
" I have just given it to you , dolt , " said Phineas Ni gellus smoothly . 
" Dumbledore says , ' Stay where you are . ' " 
" Why does he want me to stay ? 
What else did he say ? " 
Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass . 
He was exhausted , he was confused beyond measure , he had experienced terror , relief , then terror again in the last twelve hours , and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him ! 
" So that's it , is it ? " 
he said loudly . 
That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors , too ! 
We won't bother telling you anything , though , because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it ! " 
" You know , " said Phineas Nigellus , even more loudly than Harry " this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher ! 
Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything . 
Has it not occurred to you , my poor puffed - up popinjay , that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you ? Have you never paused , while feeling hard - done - by , to note that following Dumbledores orders has never yet led you into harm ? 
" He is planning something to do with me , then ? " said Harry swiftly . 
" Now , if you will excuse me , I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising … good - day to you . " 
And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight . 
Harry bellowed at the empty frame . 
Fuming , Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed , then threw himself face down on the moth - eaten covers , his eyes shut , his body heavy and aching . 
He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles … it seemed impossible that less than twenty - four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe … he was so tired … he was scared to sleep … yet he did not know how long he could fight it … Dumbledore had told him to stay … that must mean he was allowed to sleep … but he was scared … what if it happened again ? 
He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door , past rough stone walls , torches , and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left … 
He reached the black door but could not open it … he stood gazing at it , desperate for entry … something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond … a prize beyond his dreams … if only his scar would stop prickling … then he would be able to think more clearly … 
" Harry , " said Ron's voice , from far , far away , " Mum says dinner's ready , but she ' ll save you something if you want to stay in bed . " 
Harry opened his eyes , but Ron had already left the room . 
He doesn't want to be on his own with me , Harry thought . 
Not after what he heard Moody say . 
He turned over on to his other side and , after a while , dropped back off to sleep . 
He woke much later , in the early hours of the morning , his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed . 
Squinting around the room , he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him , in case he attacked somebody else . 
He half - wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore … if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on , maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all . 
Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone , watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows , threatening snow , all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him , as they were bound to be doing . 
When he heard Mrs . Weasley calling his name softly u p the stairs around lunchtime , he retreated further upstairs and ignored her . 
Around six o ' clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs . Black started screaming again . 
Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call , Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding , trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff . 
" I know you ' re in there , " said Hermione's voice . 
I want to talk to you . " 
" What are you doing here ? " 
Harry asked her , pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw - strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped . 
There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold . 
I told him it's really good because he kept laughing so much . 
Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed , but I ' ve told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study . 
They want me to do well , they ' ll understand . 
Anyway , " she said briskly , " let's go to your bedroom , Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches . " 
Harry followed her back to the second floor . 
When he entered the bedroom , he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them , sitting on Ron's bed . 
" I came on the Knight Bus , " said Hermione airily , pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak . 
" Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning , but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off . 
Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose , even though Dumbledore told her Mr . Weasley was in St . Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit . 
So … " She sat down next to Ginny , and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry . 
" How ' re you feeling ? " asked Hermione . 
" Fine , " said Harry stiffly . 
" Oh , don't lie , Harry , " she said impatiently . 
" They do , do they ? " said Harry , glaring at Ron and Ginny . 
Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed . 
" Well , you have ! " she said . 
" It's you lot who won't look at me ! " said Harry ang rily . 
" Very funny , " snapped Harry , turning away . 
" Look , the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - " " Yeah ? " growled Harry , his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside . 
Well , I'm getting used to it . " 
" We wanted to talk to you , Harry , " said Ginny , " but as you ' ve been hiding ever since we got back - " 
" I didn't want anyone to talk to me , " said Harry , w ho was feeling more and more nettled . 
" Well , that was a bit stupid of you , " said Ginny angrily , " seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You - Know - Who , and I can tell you how it feels . " 
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him . 
Then he wheeled round . 
" I forgot , " he said . 
" I'm sorry " Harry said , and he meant it . 
" So … so , do you think I'm being possessed , then ? " 
" Well , can you remember everything you ' ve been doing ? " 
Harry racked his brains . 
" No , " he said . 
" When he did it to me , I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time . 
I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there . " 
Harry hardly dared believe her , yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself . 
" That dream I had about your dad and the snake , though — " 
" Harry you ' ve had these dreams before , " Hermione said . 
" This was different , " said Harry , shaking his head . 
It was like I was the snake … what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ? " 
Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory , Harry . " 
" You didn't leave your bed , mate , " said Ron . " I saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up . " 
Harry started pacing up and down the room again , thinking . 
What they were all saying was not only comforting , it made sense … without really thinking , he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth . 
I'm not the weapon after all , thought Harry . 
His heart swelled with happiness and relief , and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeak's room , singing " God Rest Ye , Merry Hippogriffs " at the top of his voice . 
How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas ? 
He was no longer their sullen host of the summer ; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much , if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts , and he worked tirelessly in the run - up to Christmas Day , cleaning and decorating with their help , so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable . 
The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers ; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets ; a great Christmas tree , obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies , blocked Sirius's family tree from view , and even the stuffed elf - heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards . 
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own , rather larger , pile . 
Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermiones handwriting on it . 
She had given him , too , a book that resembled a diary except that it said things like " Do it today or later you ' ll pay ! " every time he opend a page . 
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts , which had superb , moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described . 
Tonks's present was a small , working model of a Firebolt , which Harry watched fly around the room , wishing he still had his full - size version ; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every - Flavour Beans , Mr . and Mrs . Weasley the usual hand - knitted jumper and some mince pies , and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself . 
He had just turned it upsidedown to see whether it looked better that way when , with a loudcrack , Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed . 
" Merry Christmas , " said George . 
" Why not ? " said Ron . 
" Mum's crying again , " said Fred heavily . 
" Percy sent back his Christmas jumper . " 
" We tried to comfort her , " said Fred , moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait . 
" So Lupin took over . 
Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast , I reckon . " 
" It's Harry ! " said George , pointing at the back of the picture , " says so on the back ! " 
Harry threw his new homework diary at him ; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily : " If you ' ve dotted the ' i's and crossed the ' t's then you may do whatever you please ! " 
They got up and dressed . 
They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling " Merry Christmas " to one another . 
On their way downstairs they met Hermione . 
" Thanks for the book , Harry " she said happily . 
And that perfume's really unusual , Ron . " 
" No problem , " said Ron . " Who's that for , anyway ? " he added , nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying . 
" Kreacher , " said Hermione brightly . 
" You know what Sirius said : Kreacher knows too much , we can't set him free ! " 
" It isn't clothes , " said Hermione , " although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag . 
" What bedroom ? " said Harry , dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother . 
" Well , Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom , more a kind of - den , " said Hermione . 
" Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen . " 
Mrs . Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there . 
She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them " Merry Christmas , " and they all averted their eyes . 
" So , is this Kreacher's bedroom ? " said Ron , strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry . 
Harry had never seen it open . 
" Yes , " said Hermione , now sounding a little nervous . 
" Er … I think we'd better knock . " 
Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply . 
" He must be sneaking around upstairs , " he said , and without further ado pulled open the door . 
Harry peered inside . 
Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old - fashioned boiler , but in the foot's space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest . 
A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night . 
In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved , magpie - like , from Sirius's purge of the house , and he had also managed to retrieve the silver - framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer . 
Their glass might be shattered , but still the little black - and - white people inside them peered up at him haughtily , including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark , heavy - lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve : Bellatrix Lestrange . 
By the looks of it , hers was Kreacher's favorite photograph ; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape . 
" I think I ' ll just leave his present here , " said Hermione , laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly . 
" Come to think of it , " said Sirius , emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door , " has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately ? " 
" I haven't seen him since the night we came back here , " said Harry . 
" You know , I think that's the last time I saw him , too … he must be hiding upstairs somewhere . " 
" He couldn't have left , could he ? " said Harry . 
" I mean , when you said ' out ' , maybe he thought you meant get out of the house ? " 
" No , no , house - elves can't leave unless they ' re given clothes . 
They're tied to their family's house , " said Sirius . 
" They can leave the house if they really want to , " Harry contradicted him . 
He had to punish himself afterwards , but he still managed it . " 
Fred , George and Ron laughed ; Hermione , however , looked reproachful . 
Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch , the Weasleys , Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr . Weasley another visit , escorted by Mad - Eye and Lupin . 
Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle , having managed to ' borrow ' a car for the occasion , as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day . 
Mrs . Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of traveling without magic - but , finally , the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed , and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace . 
A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital . 
Harry and the others got out of the car , and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them . 
They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood , then , one by one , stepped through the glass . 
The reception area looked pleasantly festive : the crystal orbs that illuminated St . Mungo's had been colored red and gold to become gigantic , glowing Christmas baubles ; holly hung around every doorway ; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner , each one topped with a gleaming gold star . 
It was less crowded than the last time they had been there , although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril . 
" Family argument , eh ? " smirked the blonde witch behind the desk . 
They found Mr . Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face . 
" Everything all right , Arthur ? " asked Mrs . Weasley , after they had all greeted Mr . Weasley and handed over their presents . 
" Fine , fine , " said Mr . Weasley , a little too heartily . 
" No , " said Mrs . Weasley suspiciously , " why ? " 
" Nothing , nothing , " said Mr . Weasley airily , starting to unwrap his pile of gifts . 
Oh , Harry - this is absolutely wonderful ! " 
Mrs . Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr . Weasley's answer . 
As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand , she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt . 
" Arthur , " she said , with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap , " you ' ve had your bandages changed . 
They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow . " 
" What ? " said Mr . Weasley , looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest . 
" No , no - it's nothing - it's - I - " 
He seemed to deflate under Mrs . Weasley's piercing gaze . 
" Well - now don't get upset , Molly , but Augustus Pye had an idea … he's the Trainee Healer , you know , lovely young chap and very interested in … um … complementary medicine … I mean , some of these old Muggle remedies … well , they ' re called stitches , Molly , and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds - " 
Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf , who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr . Weasley ; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him , grinning . 
" Do you mean to tell me , " said Mrs . Weasley , her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover , " that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies ? " 
" Not messing about , Molly , dear , " said Mr . Weasley imploringly , " it was just - just something Pye and I thought we'd try - only , most unfortunately — well , with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped - " 
" Well … well , I don't know whether you know what - what stitches are ? " 
" It sounds as though you ' ve been trying to sew your skin back together , " said Mrs . Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter , " but even you , Arthur , wouldn't be that stupid — " 
" I fancy a cup of tea , too , " said Harry , jumping to his feet . 
Hermione , Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him . 
" Typical Dad , " said Ginny , shaking her head as they set off up the corridor . 
" Stitches … I ask you … " 
" I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something . 
I wonder where the tearoom is ? " 
" Fifth floor , " said Harry , remembering the sign over the welcome witch's desk . 
They walked along the corridor , through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal - looking Healers . 
Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit . 
" And what's that supposed to be ? " he asked angrily , as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits , shoving the occupants out of the way . 
" - the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad , bind it tight about your throat , stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels ' eyes - " 
" I have not got spattergroit ! " 
" They're freckles ! " said Ron furiously . 
" Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone ! " 
" What floor's this ? " 
" I think it's the fifth , " said Hermione . 
" Nah , it's the fourth , " said Harry , " one more — " 
But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt , staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE . 
A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass . 
He had wavy blond hair , bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth . 
" Blimey ! " said Ron , also staring at the man . 
" Oh , my goodness , " said Hermione suddenly , sounding breathless . 
" Professor Lockhart ! " 
" Well , hello there ! " he said . 
" I expect you'd like my autograph , would you ? " 
" Er — how are you , Professor ? " said Ron , sounding slightly guilty . 
It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St . Mungo's in the first place , though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time , Harrys sympathy was limited . 
" I'm very well indeed , thank you ! " said Lockhart exuberantly , pulling a rather battered peacockfeather quill from his pocket . 
I can do joined - up writing now , you know ! " 
" Er - we don't want any at the moment , thanks , " said Ron , raising his eyebrows at Harry , who asked , " Professor , should you be wandering around the corridors ? 
The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face . 
For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry , then he said , " Haven't we met ? " 
" Er … yeah , we have , " said Harry . 
" You used to teach us at Hogwarts , remember ? " 
" Teach ? " repeated Lockhart , looking faintly unsettled . 
" Me ? 
Did I ? " 
" Taught you everything you know , I expect , did I ? Well , how about those autographs , then ? 
Shall we say a round dozen , you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out ! " 
But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called , 
" Gilderoy , you naughty boy , where have you wandered off to ? " 
A motherly - looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor , smiling warmly at Harry and the others . 
Do you know , he never gets visitors , poor lamb , and I can't think why , he's such a sweetie , aren't you ? " 
I just hope we ' ve got enough photographs ! " 
" He was rather well known a few years ago ; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back . 
He's in a closed ward , you know , he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents , the door's usually kept locked … not that he's dangerous ! 
But , " she lowered her voice to a whisper , " he's a bit of a danger to himself , bless him … doesn't know who he is , you see , wanders off and can't remember how to get back … it is nice of you to have come to see him . " 
But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them , and Ron's feeble mutter of " going to have a cup of tea " trailed away into nothingness . 
They looked at each other helplessly , then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor . 
" Let's not stay long , " Ron said quietly . 
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered , " Alohomora . " 
The door swung open and she led the way inside , keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoys arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed . 
" This is our long - term residents ' ward , " she informed Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny in a low voice . 
" For permanent spell damage , you know . 
Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself ; and we ' ve seen a real improvement in Mr . Bode , he seems to be regaining th e power of speech very well , though he isn't speaking any language we recognize yet . 
Well , I must finish giving out the Christmas presents , I ' ll leave you all to chat . " 
Harry looked around . 
They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr . Weasley's ward ; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard , for instance , was papered with pictures of himself , all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals . 
The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer , Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him , seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly . 
" You can put them in envelopes , " he said to Ginny , throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them . 
" I am not forgotten , you know , no , I still receive a very great deal of fan mail … Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly … I just wish I knew why . " 
A sallow - skinned , mournful - looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling ; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him . 
Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur ; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year , although fortunately the damage , in her case , had not been permanent . 
At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy . 
" Here you are , Agnes , " said the Healer brightly to the furry - faced woman , handing her a small pile of Christmas presents . 
" See , not forgotten , are you ? 
And your son's sent an owl to say he's visiting tonight , so that's nice , isn't it ? " 
" And look , Broderick , you ' ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month ; they ' ll brighten things up , won't they ? " said the Healer , bustling along to the mumbling man , setting a rather ugly plant with long , swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand . 
The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds : a formidable - looking old witch wearing a long green dress , a moth - eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and , trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed - Neville . 
With a sudden rush of understanding , Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be . 
He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned , but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name " Longbottom " , and before Harry could stop him had called out , " Neville ! " 
" Have you seen - ? Lockhart's here ! 
Who ' ve you been visiting ? " 
Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here . 
" Ah , yes , " said his grandmother , looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled , clawlike hand for him to shake . 
" Yes , yes , I know who you are , of course . 
" Er - thanks , " said Harry , shaking hands . 
Neville did not look at him , but surveyed his own feet , the color deepening in his face all the while . 
" And you two are clearly Weasleys , " Mrs . Longbottom continued , proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn . 
Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs . Longbottom knew her name , but shook hands all the same . 
" Yes , Neville's told me all about you . 
And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward , so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly . 
" What ? " said Ron , looking amazed . 
( Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot , but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you ' re wearing jeans rather than robes . ) 
" What's this ? " said Mrs . Longbottom sharply . 
" Haven't you told your friends about your parents , Neville ? " 
Neville took a deep breath , looked up at the ceiling and shook his head . 
Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone , but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation . 
" Well , it's nothing to be ashamed of ! " said Mrs . Longbottom angrily . 
" You should be proud , Neville , proud ! 
They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them , you know ! " 
" I'm not ashamed , " said Neville , very faintly , still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others . 
Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds . 
" My son and his wife , " she said , turning haughtily to Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny , " were tortured into insanity by You - Know - Who's followers . " 
Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths . 
Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified . 
" They were Aurors , you know , and very well respected within the wizarding community " Mrs . Longbottom went on . 
" Highly gifted , the pair of them . 
Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress . 
She no longer had the plump , happy - looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix . 
Her face was thin and worn now , her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair , which had turned white , was wispy and dead - looking . 
She did not seem to want to speak , or perhaps she was not able to , but she made timid motions towards Neville , holding something in her outstretched hand . 
" Very well , Alice dear , very well - Neville , take it , whatever it is . " 
But Neville had already stretched out his hand , into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper . 
" Very nice , dear , " said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice , patting his mother on the shoulder . 
But Neville said quietly , " Thanks , Mum . " 
His mother tottered away , back up the ward , humming to herself . 
Neville looked around at the others , his expression defiant , as though daring them to laugh , but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life . 
" Very nice to have met you all . 
But as they left , Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the candy wrapper into his pocket . 
The door closed behind them . 
" I never knew , " said Hermione , who looked tearful . 
" Nor me , " whispered Ginny . 
They all looked at Harry . 
" I did , " he said glumly . 
" Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone … that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for , using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds . " 
" That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den ? " 
There was a long silence , broken by Lockharts angry voice . 
Kreacher , it transpired , had been lurking in the attic . 
Sirius said he had found him up there , covered in dust , no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard . 
Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story , it made Harry uneasy . 
Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance , his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual , though once or twice Harry caught the house - elf staring at him avidly , but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that Harry had noticed . 
Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius , whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over . 
As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer , he became more and more prone to what Mrs . Weasley call ed ' fits of the sullens ' , in which he would become taciturn and grumpy , often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time . 
His gloom seeped through the house , oozing under doorways like some noxious gas , so that all of them became infected by it . 
Harry didn't want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company ; in fact , for the first time in his life , he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts . 
Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge , who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence ; there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned ; there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer ; and Dumbledore remained as remote as ever . 
In fact , if it hadn't been for the D . A . , Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place . 
Then , on the very last day of the holidays , something happened that made Harry positively dread his return to school . 
" Harry , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley , poking her head in to his and Ron's bedroom , where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione , Ginny and Crookshanks , " could you come down to the kitchen ? 
Harry did not immediately register what she had said ; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Rons and he was egging it on enthusiastically . 
Sorry , Mrs . Weasley , what did you say ? " 
" Professor Snape , dear . 
In the kitchen . 
Harry's mouth fell open in horror . 
He looked around at Ron , Hermione and Ginny , all of whom were gaping back at him . 
Crookshanks , whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour , leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover , squealing at the top of their voices . 
" Snape ? " said Harry blankly . 
" Professor Snape , dear , " said Mrs . Weasley reprovingly . 
" Now come on , quickly , he says he can't stay long . " 
" You haven't done anything , have you ? " 
" No ! " said Harry indignantly , racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place . 
A minute or two later , he pushed open the kitchen door to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table , glaring in opposite directions . 
The silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike . 
A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius . 
" Er , " said Harry , to announce his presence . 
Snape looked around at him , his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair . 
" Sit down , Potter . " 
" You know , " said Sirius loudly , leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling , " I think I'd prefer it if you didn't give orders here , Snape . 
It's my house , you see . " 
Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius , facing Snape across the table . 
" I'm his godfather , " said Sirius , louder than ever . 
" Merely that I am sure you must feel - ah - frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful , " Snape laid a delicate stress on the word , " for the Order . " 
It was Sirius's turn to flush . 
Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry . 
" The Headmaster has sent me to tell you , Potter , that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term . " 
" Study what ? " said Harry blankly . 
Snape's sneer became more pronounced . 
" Occlumency , Potter . 
The magical Defense of the mind against external penetration . 
Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed . 
" Why do I have to study Occlu — thing ? " he blurted out . 
" Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea , " said Snape smoothly . 
" You will receive private lessons once a week , but you will not tell anybody what you are doing , least of all Dolores Umbridge . 
You understand ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
Snape raised an eyebrow . 
" I am , " he said . 
He looked quickly round at Sirius for support . 
" Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry ? " asked Sirius aggressively . 
" Why you ? " 
" I assure you I did not beg for the job . " 
He got to his feet . 
Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them . " 
" Wait a moment , " said Sirius , sitting up straighter in his chair . 
Snape turned back to face them , sneering . 
" I am in rather a hurry , Black . 
Unlike you , I do not have unlimited leisure time . " 
He was rather taller than Snape who , Harry noticed , balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand . 
" If I hear you ' re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time , you ' ll have me to answer to . " 
" How touching , " Snape sneered . 
" But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father ? " 
" Yes , I have , " said Sirius proudly . 
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape , pulling out his wand as he went . 
They were squaring up to each other , Sirius looking livid , Snape calculating , his eyes darting from Sirius's wand - tip to his face . 
" Sirius ! " said Harry loudly , but Sirius appeared not to hear him . 
" Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother's house for six months ? " 
" Tell me , how is Lucius Malfoy these days ? 
I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts , isn't he ? " 
" Speaking of dogs , " said Snape softly , " did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside ? 
Sirius raised his wand . 
" NO ! " Harry yelled , vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them . 
roared Sirius , trying to push Harry out of the way , but Harry would not budge . 
" Why , yes , I suppose I am , " said Snape . 
" Harry - get - out - of - it ! " 
The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family , plus Hermione , came inside , all looking very happy , with Mr . Weasley walking proudly in thei r midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamass covered by a mackintosh . 
He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold , gazing at the scene in front of them , which was also suspended in mid - action , both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between them , a hand stretched out to each , trying to force them apart . 
" Merlin's beard , " said Mr . Weasley , the smile slidin g off his face , " what's going on here ? " 
Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands . 
Harry looked from one to the other . 
Each wore an expression of utmost contempt , yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses . 
Snape pocketed his wand , turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen , passing the Weasleys without comment . 
At the door he looked back . 
And he was gone . 
Sirius glared after him , his wand at his side . 
" What's been going on ? " asked Mr . Weasley again . 
" Nothing , Arthur , " said Sirius , who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance . 
" So … you ' re cured ? 
That's great news , really great . " 
" Yes , isn't it ? " said Mrs . Weasley , leading her husb and forward to a chair . 
" Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end , found an antidote to whatever that snake's got in its fangs , and Arthur's learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine , haven't you , dear ? " she added , rather menacingly . 
" Yes , Molly , dear , " said Mr . Weasley meekly . 
That night's meal should have been a cheerful one , with Mr . Weasley back amongst them . 
Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so , yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food , his face fell back into a moody , brooding expression . 
Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad - Eye , who had dropped in to offer Mr . Weasley their congratulations . 
He wanted to talk to Sirius , to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said , that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place . 
But he had no opportunity to do so , and , eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face , Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance . 
Instead , he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape . 
" Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort , " said Hermione at once . 
" Well , you won't be sorry not to have them any more , will you ? " 
" Extra lessons with Snape ? " said Ron , sounding aghast . 
They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day , escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin , both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry , Ron and Hermione came down next morning . 
The adults seemed to have been mid - way through a whispered conversation as Harry opened the door ; all of them looked round hastily and fell silent . 
After a hurried breakfast , they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey January morning . 
Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest ; he did not want to say goodbye to Sirius . 
He had a bad feeling about this parting ; he didn't know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid - Harry was worried that Snape's accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place . 
Before he could think of what to say , however , Sirius had beckoned him to his side . 
" I want you to take this , " he said quietly , thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry's hands . 
" What is it ? " 
Harry asked . 
" I doubt Molly would approve - but I want you to use it if you need me , all right ? " 
" Okay , " said Harry , stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket , but he knew he would never use whatever it was . 
" Let's go , then , " said Sirius , clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly , and before Harry could say anything else , they were heading upstairs , stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door , surrounded by Weasleys . 
" Goodbye , Harry , take care , " said Mrs . Weasley , hugg ing him . 
" See you , Harry , and keep an eye out for snakes for me ! " said Mr . Weasley genially , shaking his hand . 
" Right - yeah , " said Harry distractedly ; it was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful ; he turned , looked into his godfather's face : and opened his mouth to speak , but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief , one - armed hug , and saying gruffly , " Look after yourself , Harry . " 
Next moment , Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air , with Tonks ( today heavily disguised as a tall , tweedy woman with iron - grey hair ) chivvying him down the steps . 
The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them . 
They followed Lupin down the front steps . 
" Come on , the quicker we get on the bus the better , " said Tonks , and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square . 
Lupin flung out his right arm . 
BANG . 
A violently purple , triple - decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them , narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost , which jumped backwards out of its way . 
A thin , pimply , jug - eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said , " Welcome to the - " 
" On , on , get on - " 
And she shoved Harry forwards towards the steps , past the conductor , who goggled at Harry as he passed . 
Ginny and Hermione forwards . 
" I ' ve always wanted to go on this thing , " said Ron happily , joining Harry on board and looking around . 
Now , in the early morning , it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows . 
Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place ; a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet , grumbling , and somebody's shopping bag had slid the length of the bus : an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn , cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor . 
" Fred , George and Ginny , if you just take those seats at the back … Remus can stay with you . " 
She , Harry , Ron and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck , where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back . 
Stan Shunpike , the conductor , followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back . 
Heads turned as Harry passed and , when he sat down , he saw all the faces flick back to the front again . 
As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each , the bus set off again , swaying ominously . 
It rumbled around Grimmauld Place , weaving on and off the pavement , then , with another tremendous BANG , they were all flung backwards ; Ron's chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon , who had been on his lap , burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to Hermione's shoulder instead . 
Harry , who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket , looked out of the window : they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway . 
" Just outside Birmingham , " said Stan happily , answe ring Harry's unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor . 
I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer , but it weren't never nuffink very nice . 
I said to Ern , I said , ' e didn't seem like a nutter when we met ' im , just goes to show , dunnit ? " 
He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze , enthralled , at Harry . 
Apparently , Stan did not care how nutty somebody was , if they were famous enough to be in the paper . 
Looking towards the front of the bus , Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands , Pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder . 
BANG . 
Chairs slid backwards again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends . 
Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges . 
From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town , then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills , then to a windswept road between high - rise flats , each time with a loud BANG . 
" I ' ve changed my mind , " muttered Ron , picking himse lf up from the floor for the sixth time , " I never want to ride on this thing again . " 
A few minutes later , the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub , which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision . 
They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck . 
BANG . 
They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade . 
Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog's Head down its side street , the severed boar's head sign creaking in the wintry wind . 
Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus . 
At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts . 
Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them , noses flat against the windows . 
" You ' ll be safe once you ' re in the grounds , " said Tonks , casting a careful eye around at the deserted road . 
" And listen … " he lowered his voice while the rest of the m exchanged last - minute goodbyes with Tonks , " Harry , I know you don't like Snape , but he is a superb Occlumens and we all - Sirius included - want you to learn to protect yourself , so work hard , all right ? " 
" See you , then . " 
The six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle , dragging their trunks . 
Harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors ; the Knight Bus had already gone and he half - wished , given what was coming the following evening , that he was still on board . 
Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening . 
" I ' ll let you know in the usual way when the next one is , " Harry said over and over again , " but I can't do it tonight , I ' ve got to go to - er - remedial Potions . " 
I can still get him from here , " he said , raising his wand and taking aim between Smith's shoulder blades . 
" Forget it , " said Harry dismally . 
" It's what everyone's going to think , isn't it ? 
That I'm really stup — " " Hi , Harry , " said a voice behind him . 
He turned round and found Cho standing there . 
" Oh , " said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably . 
" Hi . " 
" We ' ll be in the library , Harry , " said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase . 
" Yeah , not bad , " said Harry . 
" Mine was pretty quiet , " said Cho . 
For some reason , she was looking rather embarrassed . 
" What ? 
" Yes , it's on Valentine's Day … " 
" Right , " said Harry , wondering why she was telling him this . 
" Well , I suppose you want to - ? " 
" Only if you do , " she said eagerly . 
Harry stared . 
He had been about to say , " I suppose you want to know when the next D . A . meetingis ? " 
but her response did not seem to fit . 
" I - er — " he said . 
" Oh , it's okay if you don't , " she said , looking mortified . 
I - I ' ll see you around . " 
She walked away . 
He ran after her , catching her halfway up the marble staircase . 
" Er - d ' you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine's Day ? " 
" Oooh , yes ! " she said , blushing crimson and beaming at him . 
" Right … well … that's settled then , " said Harry , and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all , he headed off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons , walking in a rather bouncy way himself . 
He paused outside the door when he reached it , wishing he were almost anywhere else , then , taking a deep breath , he knocked and entered . 
The shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously colored potions . 
In one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry - not without reason - of robbing . 
Harry's attention was drawn towards the desk , however , where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight . 
Harry recognized it at once - it was 
Dumbledore's Pensieve . 
Wondering what on earth it was doing there , he jumped when Snape's cold voice came out of the shadows . 
" Shut the door behind you , Potter . " 
Harry did as he was told , with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself . 
When he turned back into the room , Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk . 
Harry sat down and so did Snape , his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry , dislike etched in every line of his face . 
" Well , Potter , you know why you are here , " he said . 
" The Headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency . 
I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at Potions . " 
" Right , " said Harry tersely . 
" This may not be an ordinary class , Potter , " said Snape , his eyes narrowed malevolently , " but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me'sir ' or ' professor ' at all times . " 
" Yes … sir , " said Harry . 
Snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment , then said , " Now , Occlumency . 
As I told you back in your dear godfather's kitchen , this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence . " 
" And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it , sir ? " said Harry , looking directly into Snape's eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer . 
Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously , " Surely even you could have worked that out by now , Potter ? 
The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency - " 
" What's that ? 
Sir ? " 
" It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another persons mind - " 
" You do not understand fine distinctions . 
It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion - maker . " 
Snape paused for a moment , apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting Harry , before continuing . 
The mind is not a book , to be opened at will and examined at leisure . 
" It is true , however , that those who have mastered Legilimency are able , under certain conditions , to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly . 
The Dark Lord , for instance , almost always knows when somebody is lying to him . 
Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie , and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection . " 
Whatever Snape said , Legilimency sounded like mind - reading to Harry , and he didn't like the sound of it at all . 
" So he could know what we ' re thinking right now ? Sir ? " 
" The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them , " said Snape . 
" Time and space matter in magic , Potter . 
Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency . " 
" Well then , why do I have to learn Occlumency ? " 
" The usual rules do not seem to apply with you , Potter . 
The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord . 
The Headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue . 
He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord . " 
Harry's heart was pumping fast again . 
" But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it ? " he asked abruptly . 
" I don't like it much , but it's been useful , hasn't it ? 
I mean … I saw that snake attack Mr . Weasley and if I hadn't , Professor Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to save him , would he ? Sir ? " 
Snape stared at Harry for a few moments , still tracing his mouth with his finger . 
When he spoke again , it was slowly and deliberately , as though he weighed every word . 
" It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently . 
" The one with the snake and Mr . Weasley ? " 
" Do not interrupt me , Potter , " said Snape in a dangerous voice . 
" As I was saying , the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord's thoughts - " 
" I saw inside the snake's head , not his ! " 
" I thought I just told you not to interrupt me , Potter ? " 
But Harry did not care if Snape was angry ; at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business ; he had moved forwards in his chair so that , without realizing it , he was perched on the very edge , tense as though poised for flight . 
" How come I saw through the snakes eyes if it's Voldemort's thoughts I'm sharing ? " 
" Do not say the Dark Lord's name ! " spat Snape . 
There was a nasty silence . 
They glared at each other across the Pensieve . 
" Professor Dumbledore says his name , " said Harry quietly . 
" While he may feel secure enough to use the name … the rest of us … " He rubbed his left forearm , apparently unconsciously , on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin . 
" I just wanted to know , " Harry began again , forcing his voice back to politeness , " why - " 
" You seem to have visited the snake's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment , " snarled Snape . 
" He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it , too . " 
" And Vol — he - realized I was there ? " 
" It seems so , " said Snape coolly . 
" How do you know ? " said Harry urgently . 
" I told you , " said Snape , rigid in his chair , his eyes slits , " to call me'sir ' . " 
" Yes , sir , " said Harry impatiently , " but how do you know - ? " 
" It is enough that we know , " said Snape repressively . 
" The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings . 
He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse ; that is to say , he has realized that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return - " 
" And he might try and make me do things ? " 
asked Harry . 
" Sir ? " he added hurriedly . 
Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and Harry tensed in his chair , but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair . 
Twice more , Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin , then , without offering any explanation of his behavior , he picked up the Pensieve carefully , removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready . 
" Stand up and take out your wand , Potter . " 
They faced each other with the desk between them . 
" You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me , or defend yourself in any other way you can think of , " said Snape . 
" And what are you going to do ? " Harry asked , eyeing Snape's wand apprehensively . 
" I am about to attempt to break into your mind , " said Snape softly . 
Legilimens ! " 
Snape had struck before Harry was ready , before he had even begun to summon any force of resistance . 
The office swam in front of his eyes and vanished ; image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings . 
He was five , watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle , and his heart was bursting with jealousy … he was nine , and Ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing below on the lawn … he was sitting under the Sorting Hat , and it was telling him he would do well in Slytherin … Hermione was lying in the hospital wing , her face covered with thick black hair … a hundred Dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake … Cho Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe … 
" No , " said a voice inside Harry's head , as the memory of Cho drew nearer , " you ' re not watching that , you ' re not watching it , it's private – " 
He felt a sharp pain in his knee . 
Snape's office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor ; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape's desk . 
He looked up at Snape , who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist . 
" No , " said Harry bitterly , getting up from the floor . 
You lost control . " 
" Did you see everything I saw ? " 
" My Aunt Marge , " Harry muttered , hating Snape . 
" You managed to stop me eventually , though you wasted time and energy shouting . 
Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand . " 
" I'm trying , " said Harry angrily , " but you ' re not telling me how ! " 
" Manners , Potter , " said Snape dangerously . 
" Now , I want you to close your eyes . " 
Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told . 
" Clear your mind , Potter , " said Snape's cold voice . 
But Harry's anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom . 
Harry tried to empty his mind , tried not to think , or remember , or feel … 
" Let's go again … on the count of three … one - two - three - Legilimens ! " 
A great black dragon was rearing in front of him … his father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror … Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him … 
Harry was on his knees again , his face buried in his hands , his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull . 
" Get up ! " said Snape sharply . 
" Get up ! 
You are not trying , you are making no effort . 
You are allowing me access to memories you fear , handing me weapons ! " 
Harry stood up again , his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard . 
" I told you to empty yourself of emotion ! " 
" Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord ! " said Snape savagely . 
" Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves , who cannot control their emotions , who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easily - weak people , in other words - they stand no chance against his powers ! 
" I am not weak , " said Harry in a low voice , fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment . 
" Then prove it ! 
spat Snape . 
" Control your anger , discipline your mind ! 
Legilimens ! " 
He was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letterbox shut … a hundred Dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds towards him … he was running along a windowless passage with Mr . Weasley … they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor … Harry expected to go through it … but Mr . Weasley led him off to the left , down a flight of stone steps … 
" I KNOW ! 
I KNOW ! " 
He was on all fours again on Snape's office floor , his scar was prickling unpleasantly , but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant . 
He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at him , his wand raised . 
It looked as though , this time , Snape had lifted the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back . 
" What happened then , Potter ? " he asked , eyeing Harry intently . 
" I saw - I remembered , " Harry panted . 
" I ' ve just realized … " 
" Realized what ? " asked Snape sharply . 
Harry did not answer at once ; he was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as he rubbed his forehead … 
He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months , without once realizing that it was a real place . 
Now , seeing the memory again , he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr . Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry ; it was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries and Mr . Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort's snake . 
He looked up at Snape . 
" What's in the Department of Mysteries ? " 
" What did you say ? " Snape asked quietly and Harry saw , with deep satisfaction , that Snape was unnerved . 
" I said , what's in the Department of Mysteries , sir ? " Harry said . 
" Because " said Harry , watching Snape's face closely , " that corridor I ' ve just seen - I ' ve been dreaming about it for months — I ' ve just recognized it - it leads to the Department of Mysteries … and I think Voldemort wants something from — " 
" I have told you not to say the Dark Lord's name ! " 
They glared at each other . 
Harrys scar seared again , but he did not care . 
Snape looked agitated ; but when he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned . 
" I want you back here same time on Wednesday . 
We will continue work then . " 
" Fine , " said Harry . 
He was desperate to get out of Snape's office and find Ron and Hermione . 
" You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep ; empty it , make it blank and calm , you understand ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry , who was barely listening . 
" And be warned , Potter … I shall know if you have not practiced " 
" Right , " Harry mumbled . 
He picked up his schoolbag , swung it over his shoulder and hurried towards the office door . 
As he opened it , he glanced back at Snape , who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head . 
Harry left without another word , closing the door carefully behind him , his scar still throbbing painfully . 
Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library , where they were working on Umbridge's most recent ream of homework . 
The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince's shoes , as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly , breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books . 
Harry felt shivery ; his scar was still aching , he felt almost feverish . 
When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione , he caught sight of himself in the window opposite ; he was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual . 
" How did it go ? " 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " 
" Listen … I ' ve just realized something " 
And he told them what he had just seen and deduced . 
" So … so are you saying … " whispered Ron , as Madam Pince swept past , squeaking slightly , " that the weapon - the thing You - Know - Who's after — is in the Ministry of Magic ? " " In the Department of Mysteries , it's got to be , " H arry whispered . 
" I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it's definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him . " 
" Of course , " she breathed . 
" Of course what ? " said Ron rather impatiently . 
" Ron , think about it … Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic … it must have been that one , it's too much of a coincidence ! " 
" How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he's on our side ? " said Ron . 
" Well , I don't know , " Hermione admitted . 
" That is a bit odd … " 
" So what's in the Department of Mysteries ? " 
Harry asked Ron . 
" I know they call the people who work in there ' Unspeakables ' , " said Ron , frowning . 
" It's not weird at all , it makes perfect sense , " said Hermione . 
For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it . 
" I just feel a bit … I don't like Occlumency much . " 
But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement ; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise . 
" Headless Hats ! " shouted George , as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students . 
Fred swept the hat on to his head , beaming . 
For a second he merely looked rather stupid ; then both hat and head vanished . 
" And off again ! " shouted George , and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder ; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink - feathered hat from it . 
" How do those hats work , then ? " said Hermione , distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely . 
" I mean , obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell , but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object … I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though . " 
Harry did not answer ; he was feeling ill . 
" I'm going to have to do this tomorrow , " he muttered , pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it . 
Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag , withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively . 
Hermione beamed at it . 
" I think I ' ll go to bed , " said Harry , stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got . 
He walked across the common room , dodging George , who tried to put a Headless Hat on him , and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys'dormitories . 
He was feeling sick again , just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake , but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right . 
He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head . 
He did not know where he was , whether he was standing or lying down , he did not even know his own name . 
Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears … he was happier than he had been in a very long time … jubilant , ecstatic , triumphant … a wonderful , wonderful thing had happened … 
" Harry ? 
The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain . 
The happiness was draining out of him , but the laughter continued … 
He opened his eyes and , as he did so , he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth . 
The moment he realized this , it died away ; Harry lay panting on the floor , staring up at the ceiling , the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly . 
Ron was bending over him , looking very worried . 
" What happened ? " he said . 
" I … dunno … " Harry gasped , sitting up again . 
" He's really happy … really happy … " 
" Something good's happened , " mumbled Harry . 
He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr . Weasley and felt very sick . 
The words came , just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room , as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth , yet he knew they were true . 
He took deep breaths , willing himself not to vomit all over Ron . 
He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time . 
" Hermione told me to come and check on you , " said Ron in a low voice , helping Harry to his feet . 
He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him towards his bed . 
He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind's resistance rather than strengthening it , and he wondered , with a feeling of great trepidation , what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years . 
Harry's question was answered the very next morning . 
When Hermione's DailyProphet arrived she smoothed it out , gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her . 
" What ? " said Harry and Ron together . 
For an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten blackand - white photographs that filled the whole of the front page , nine showing wizards ' faces and the tenth , a witch's . 
Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering ; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures , looking insolent . 
Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban . 
Antonin Dolohov , read the legend beneath a wizard with a long , pale , twisted face who was sneering up at Harry , convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett . 
Augustus Rookwood , said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture , looking bored , convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic secrets to He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named . 
But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch . 
Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page . 
She had long , dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture , though he had seen it sleek , thick and shining . 
Like Sirius , she retained vestiges of great good looks , but something - perhaps Azkaban - had taken most of her beauty . 
Bellatrix Lestrange , convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom . 
Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures , which Harry , concentrating on Bellatrix , had not yet read . 
" Black ? " said Harry loudly . 
" Not - ? " 
" Not so loud - just read it ! " 
The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from 
Speaking to reporters in his private office , Cornelius Fudge , Minister for Magic , confirmed that ten high - security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals . 
" We find ourselves , most unfortunately , in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped , " said Fudge last night . 
An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help , and we must remember that Black , as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban , would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps . 
We think it likely that these individuals , who include Black's cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange , have rallied around Black as their leader . 
We are , however , doing all we can to round up the criminals , and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious . 
" There you are , Harry , " said Ron , looking awestruck . 
" That's why he was happy last night . " 
" I don't believe this , " snarled Harry , " Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius ? " 
" What other options does he have ? " said Hermione bitterly . 
I mean , he's spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars , hasn't he ? " 
Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall . 
He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page , but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione . 
There they all were , talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish , when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort's ranks . 
He glanced up at the staff table . 
It was a different story there : Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation , both looking extremely grave . 
Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon . 
Meanwhile , at the far end of the table , Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge . 
She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently . 
" Oh my - " said Hermione wonderingly , still staring at the newspaper . 
" What now ? " said Harry quickly ; he was feeling jumpy . 
" It's … horrible , " said Hermione , looking shaken . 
She fold ed back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to Harry and Ron . 
St . Mungo's Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode , 49 , was discovered dead in his bed , strangled by a potted - plant . 
Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr . Bode , who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death . 
Healer Miriam Strout , who was in charge of Mr . Bodes ward at the time of the incident , has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday , but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement : 
Mungo's deeply regrets the death of Mr . Bode , whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident . 
" We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout , busy over the Christmas period , overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr . Bode's bedside table . 
As his speech and mobility improved , Healer Strout encouraged Mr . Bode to look after the plant himself , unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom , but a cutting of Devil's Snare which , when touched by the convalescent Mr . Bode , throttled him instantly . 
Mungo's is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward . " 
" Bode … " said Ron . " Bode . 
It rings a bell … " 
" We saw him , " Hermione whispered . 
" In St . Mungo's , remember ? 
He was in the bed opposite Lockhart's , just lying there , staring at the ceiling . 
And we saw the Devil's Snare arrive . 
She - the Healer - said it was a Christmas present . " 
Harry looked back at the story . 
A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat . 
We ' ve seen it before … we could ' ve stopped this from happening . " 
" Who expects Devils Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant ? " said Ron sharply . 
" It's not our fault , whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame ! 
They must be a real prat , why didn't they check what they were buying ? " 
" Oh , come on , Ron ! " said Hermione shakily . 
" I don't think anyone could put Devils Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it ? 
This - this was murder … a clever murder , as well … if the plant was sent anonymously , how's anyone ever going to find out who did it ? " 
Harry was not thinking about Devil's Snare . 
He was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing and the sallow - faced man who had got in on the . 
" I met Bode , " he said slowly . 
" I saw him at the Ministry with your dad . " 
" I ' ve heard Dad talk about him at home ! 
He was an Unspeakable - he worked in the Department of Mysteries ! " 
They looked at each other for a moment , then Hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her , closed it , glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front , then leapt to her feet . 
" Where are you going ? " said Ron , startled . 
" It … well , I don't know whether … but it's worth trying … and I'm the only one who can . " 
" I hate it when she does that , " grumbled Ron , as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own , slower way out of the Great Hall . 
" Would it kill her to tell us what she's up to for once ? 
It'd take her about ten more seconds - hey , Hagrid ! " 
Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the Entrance Hall , waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass . 
He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose . 
" All righ ' , you two ? " he said , trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace . 
" Are you okay , Hagrid ? " asked Harry , following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws . 
" Fine , fine , " said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness ; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened - looking Professor Vector , who was passing . 
" You ' re on probation ? " said Ron very loudly , so that many of the passing students looked around curiously . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid . 
See yeh , Harry … Ron … " 
He trudged away , out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds . 
Harry watched him go , wondering how much more bad news he could stand . 
The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days , but to Harry's indignation , hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it ; indeed , some people , Draco Malfoy prominent among them , seemed positively gleeful . 
As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St . Mungo's , Harry , Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared . 
There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now : the ten escaped Death Eaters , whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers . 
Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade , that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts , just as Sirius Black had once done . 
Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts ; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary . 
There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students , who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors : Susan Bones , whose uncle , aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten , said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry . 
It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days , yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers ' voices . 
They sounded curious rather than hostile now , and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophets version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress . 
In their confusion and fear , these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them : the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year . 
It was not only the students ' mood that had changed . 
" They obviously can't talk freely in the staff room any more , " said Hermione in a low voice , as she , Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall , Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day . 
" Not with Umbridge there . " 
" Reckon they know anything new ? " said Ron , gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers . 
" If they do , we ' re not going to hear about it , are we ? " said Harry angrily . 
" Not after Decree … 
what number are we on now ? " 
For new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout : 
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOROF HOGWARTS 
Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach . 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty - six . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , High Inquisitor 
This latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students . 
Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class . 
" Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts , Professor ! 
That's not information relating to your subject ! " 
When Harry next saw Lee , the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly . 
Harry had thought the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little , that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved Fudge . 
It seemed , however , to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control . 
She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long , and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first . 
Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard . 
She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room , interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology , insisting that she predicted students ' answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball , the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn . 
Several times he passed her in the corridors - in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room - muttering wildly to herself , wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder , and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry . 
If he had not been so worried about Hagrid , he would have felt sorry for her - but if one of them was to be ousted from their job , there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain . 
Unfortunately , Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney . 
Though he seemed to be following Hermione's advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a Crup — a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail - since before Christmas , he too seemed to have lost his nerve . 
He was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons , losing the thread of what he was saying to the class , answering questions wrongly , and all the time glancing anxiously at Umbridge . 
He was also more distant with Harry , Ron and Hermione than he had ever been before , and had expressly forbidden them to visit him after dark . 
" If she catches yeh , it ' ll be all of our necks on the line , " he told them flatly , and with no desire to do anything that might jeoparize his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings . 
It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living : visits to Hagrid's house , letters from Sirius , his Firebolt and Quidditch . 
Harry was pleased to see that all of them , even Zacharias Smith , had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose , but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville . 
The news of his parents ' attackers ' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him . 
He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry , Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St . Mungo's and , taking their lead from him , they had kept quiet about it too . 
Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers ' escape . 
In fact , Neville barely spoke during the D . A . meetings any more , but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter - curse Harry taught them , his plump face screwed up in concentration , apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room . 
He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm - a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker - only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville . 
On the contrary Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson . 
He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemorts mood , and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape . 
What was more , he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night , dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door . 
" Maybe it's a bit like an illness , " said Hermione , looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron . 
It has to get worse before it gets better . " 
" I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night . " 
He rubbed his forehead angrily . 
" I just wish the door would open , I'm sick of standing staring at it - " 
" That's not funny , " said Hermione sharply . 
" Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all , or he wouldn't have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency . 
You ' re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons . " 
" I am working ! " said Harry nettled . 
" You try it some time - Snape trying to get inside your head - it's not a bundle of laughs , you know ! " 
" Maybe … " said Ron slowly . 
" Maybe what ? " said Hermione , rather snappishly . 
" Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind , " said Ron darkly . 
" What do you mean ? " said Hermione . 
" Well , maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry … " 
Harry and Hermione stared at him . 
Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other . 
" Maybe , " he said again , in a lower voice , " he's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider … make it easier for You - Know — " 
" Shut up , Ron , " said Hermione angrily . 
" How many times have you suspected Snape , and when have you ever been right ? 
Dumbledore trusts him , he works for the Order , that ought to be enough . " 
" And if we can't trust Dumbledore , we can't trust anyone . " 
With so much to worry about and so much to do - startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth - years working until past midnight , secret D . A . sessions and regular classes with Snape - January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast . 
Before Harry knew it , February had arrived , bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year . 
Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together , but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in her company . 
On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully . 
He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls . 
Hedwig was not there - not that Harry had expected her - but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down . 
If it hadn't come today … " she said , eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment . 
Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face . 
" Listen , Harry , " she said , looking up at him , " this is really important . 
Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday ? " 
" Well … I dunno , " said Harry uncertainly . 
We never said what we were going to do . " 
" Well , bring her along if you must , " said Hermione urgently . 
" But will you come ? " 
" I haven't got time to tell you now , I ' ve got to answer this quickly . " 
And she hurried out of the Great Hall , the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other . 
" Are you coming ? " 
Harry asked Ron , but he shook his head , looking glum . 
" I can't come into Hogsmeade at all ; Angelina wants a full day's training . 
Like it's going to help ; we ' re the worst team I ' ve ever seen . 
You should see Sloper and Kirke , they ' re pathetic , even worse than I am . " 
" It's because you ' re good when you ' re on form , that's why , " said Harry irritably . 
He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron's plight , when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff . 
Ron seemed to have noticed Harrys tone , because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast , and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards . 
Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry , after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon , proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho , feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about . 
She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors , looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long pony - tail . 
Harry's feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides . 
" Hi , " said Harry . 
They stared at each other for a moment , then Harry said , " Well - er — shall we go , then ? " 
" Oh - yes … " 
They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch , occasionally catching each other's eye and grinning shiftily , but not talking to each other . 
Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air , finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward . 
It was a fresh , breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them . 
" You really miss it , don't you ? " said Cho . 
He looked round and saw her watching him . 
" Yeah , " sighed Harry . 
" I do . " 
" Remember the first time we played against each other , in the third year ? " she asked him . 
" Yeah , " said Harry , grinning . 
" You kept blocking me . " 
" And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to , " said Cho , smiling reminiscently . 
" Nah , it was Puddlemere United ; I saw him at the World Cup last year . " 
" Oh , I saw you there , too , remember ? 
We were on the same campsite . 
The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates . 
Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her - no more difficult , in fact , than talking to Ron and Hermione - and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them , including Pansy Parkinson . 
" Urgh , Chang , I don't think much of your taste … at least Diggory was good - looking ! " 
The girls sped up , talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho , leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake . 
Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch , and Cho , slightly flushed , was watching her feet . 
" So … where d ' you want to go ? " Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade . 
The High Street was full of students ambling up and down , peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements . 
They wandered towards Dervish and Banges . 
A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it . 
They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters . 
The poster , By Order of the Ministry of Magic , offered a thousand - Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured . 
" It's funny , isn't it , " said Cho in a low voice , gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters , " remember when that Sirius Black escaped , and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him ? 
And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere … " 
" Yeah , that is weird . " 
They had not only let the Death Eaters escape , they weren't bothering to look for them … it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now . 
The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed . 
It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft's ; cold , heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck . 
" Um … d ' you want to get a coffee ? " said Cho tentatively , as the rain began to fall more heavily . 
" Yeah , all right , " said Harry , looking around . 
" Oh , there's a really nice place just up here ; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's ? " she said brightly , leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before . 
It was a cramped , steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows . 
Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge's office . 
" Er … yeah , " said Harry untruthfully . 
" Look , she's decorated it for Valentine's Day ! " said Cho , indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small , circular tables , occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants . 
" Aaah … " 
They sat down at the last remaining table , which was over by the steamy window . 
Roger Davies , the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl . 
They were holding hands . 
The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable , particularly when , looking around the teashop , he saw that it was full of nothing but couples , all of them holding hands . 
Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand . 
" What can I get you , m'dears ? " said Madam Puddifoot , a very stout woman with a shiny black bun , squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty . 
" Two coffees , please , " said Cho . 
In the time it took for their coffees to arrive , Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl . 
Harry wished they wouldn't ; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete . 
He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window , but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside . 
To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho , he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub . 
After a few more painful minutes , Cho mentioned Umbridge . 
Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her , but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D . A . meetings it did not last very long . 
Silence fell again . 
Harry wasvery conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around forsomething else to say . 
" Er … listen , d ' you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime ? 
I'm meeting Hermione Granger there . " 
Cho raised her eyebrows . 
Today ? " 
Well , she asked me to , so I thought I would . 
D ' you want to come with me ? 
She said it wouldn't matter if you did . " 
On the contrary , her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding . 
A few more minutes passed in total silence , Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup . 
Beside them , Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the lips . 
Cho's hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it . 
Just do it , he told himself , as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest , just reach out and grab it . 
Amazing , how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair … But just as he moved his hand forwards , Cho took hers off the table . 
She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression . 
" He asked me out , you know , " she said in a quiet voice . 
Roger . 
Harry , who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table , could not think why she was telling him this . 
If she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by Roger Davies , why had she agreed to come out with him ? 
He said nothing . 
Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them ; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink . 
" I came in here with Cedric last year , " said Cho . 
He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now , while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads . 
Cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again . 
" I ' ve been meaning to ask you for ages … did Cedric - did he - m - m - mention me at all before he died ? " 
" Well - no - " he said quietly . 
" There - there wasn't time for him to say anything . 
You support the Tornados , right ? " 
His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery . 
To his horror , he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again , just as they had been after the last D . A . meeting before Christmas . 
" Look , " he said desperately , leaning in so that nob ody else could overhear , " let's not talk about Cedric right now … let's talk about something else . " 
" I thought , " she said , tears spattering down on to the table , " I thought you'd u - u - understand ! 
I need to talk about it ! 
Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too ! 
I mean , you saw it happen , d - didn't you ? " 
" Well - I have talked about it , " Harry said in a whisper , " to Ron and Hermione , but - " 
" Oh , you ' ll talk to Hermione Granger ! " she said shrilly , her face now shining with tears . 
" But you won't talk to me ! P - perhaps it would be best if we just … just p - paid and you went and met up with Hermione G - Granger , like you obviously want to ! " 
Harry stared at her , utterly bewildered , as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it . 
" Cho ? " he said weakly , wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho . 
" I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you ' re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me … how many are you meeting after Hermione ? " 
" It's not like that ! " said Harry , and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed , which he realized a split second too late was also a mistake . 
Cho sprang to her feet . 
The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now . 
" I ' ll see you around , Harry " she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door , wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain . 
" Cho ! " Harry called after her , but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle . 
There was total silence within the teashop . 
He threw a Galleon down on to the table , shook pink confetti out of his hair , and followed Cho out of the door . 
It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen . 
He simply did not understand what had happened ; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine . 
" Women ! " he muttered angrily , sloshing down the rain - washed street with his hands in his pockets . 
Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe ? " 
He turned right and broke into a splashy run , and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks . 
He knew he was too early to meet Hermione , but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time . 
He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around . 
Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner , looking morose . 
" Hi , Hagrid ! " he said , when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him . 
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognized him . 
Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises . 
" Oh , it's yeh , Harry , " said Hagrid . 
" Yeh all right ? " 
" Yeah , I'm fine , " lied Harry ; but , next to this battered and mournful - looking Hagrid , he felt he didn't really have much to complain about . 
" Er - are you okay ? " 
" Me ? " said Hagrid . 
He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard , which was the size of a large bucket , and sighed . 
Harry didn't know what to say to him . 
They sat side by side in silence for a moment . 
" Er - " said Harry . 
He took a great swig from his tankard . 
" Makes a diff ' rence , havin ' a decent family , " he said . 
" Yeah … I s ' pose , " said Harry cautiously . 
Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood . 
And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye . 
" Hagrid , " said Harry , unable to stop himself , " where are you getting all these injuries ? " 
" All those ! " said Harry , pointing at Hagrid's face . 
He drained his tankard , set it back on the table and got to his feet . 
And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched , and disappeared into the torrential rain . 
Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something , but he seemed determined not to accept help . 
What was going on ? 
But before Harry could think about it any further , he heard a voice calling his name . 
" Harry ! Harry , over here ! " 
Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room . 
He got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub . 
He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone . 
She was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined : Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter , ex - journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione's least favorite people in the world . 
" You ' re early ! " said Hermione , moving along to give him room to sit down . 
" I thought you were with Cho , I wasn't expecting you for another hour at least ! " 
" Cho ? " said Rita at once , twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at Harry . 
She snatched up her crocodile - skin handbag and groped within it . 
" So you can put that away right now . " 
Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap , she snapped her bag shut again . 
" What are you up to ? " 
Harry asked , sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione . 
" Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived , " said Rita , taking a large slurp of her drink . 
" I suppose I'm allowed to talk to him , am I ? " she shot at Hermione . 
" Yes , I suppose you are , " said Hermione coldly . 
The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face . 
The scarlet paint on her two - inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses . 
She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth , " Pretty girl , is she , Harry ? " 
" One more word about Harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise , " said Hermione irritably . 
" What deal ? " said Rita , wiping her mouth on the back of her hand . 
Oh , one of these days … " She took a deep shuddering breath . 
" Yes , yes , one of these days you ' ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me , " said Hermione indifferently . 
" They ' ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help , " said Rita , shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper , " How has that made you feel , Harry ? 
" He feels angry , of course , " said Hermione in a hard , clear voice . 
" Because he's told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him . " 
" So you actually stick to it , do you , that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back ? " said Rita , lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag . 
" There were a dozen - odd Death Eaters there as well . 
Want their names ? " 
" I'd love them , " breathed Rita , now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen . 
And then , beneath a nice big photograph of you , ' Disturbed teenage survivor of You - Know - Who'sattack , Harry Potter , 15 , caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters … ' " 
The Quick - Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died . 
" But of course , " she said , lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione , " Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there , would she ? " 
" As a matter of fact , " said Hermione sweetly , " that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want . " 
Rita stared at her . 
So did Harry . 
Luna , on the other hand , sang Weasley is our King dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick . 
" You want me to report what he says about He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? " Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice . 
" Yes , I do , " said Hermione . 
" The true story . 
All the facts . 
He ' ll give you all the details , he ' ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there , he ' ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now - oh , get a grip on yourself , " she added contemptuously , throwing a napkin across the table , for , at the sound of Voldemort's name , Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself . 
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat , still staring at Hermione . 
Then she said baldly , " The Prophet wouldn't print it . 
Now , if you let me write the story from that angle - " 
" We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles ! " said Hermione angrily . 
I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth ! " 
" There's no market for a story like that , " said Rita coldly . 
" You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them , " said Hermione irritably . 
Rita gave Hermione a long , hard look . 
Then , leaning forwards across the table towards her , she said in a businesslike tone , " All right , Fudge is leaning on the Prophet , but it comes to the same thing . 
They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light . 
Nobody wants to read it . 
It's against the public mood . 
People just don't want to believe You - Know - Whos back . " 
" So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear , does it ? " said Hermione scathingly . 
Rita sat up straight again , her eyebrows raised , and drained her glass of Firewhisky . 
" The Prophet exists to sell itself , you silly girl , " she said coldly . 
He doesn't care about making money . " 
Rita looked disparagingly at Luna . 
" Probably , Twenty - Five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale ? " 
" No , " said Luna , dipping her onion back into her Gillywater , " he's the editor of The Quibbler . " 
" I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag . " 
" Well , this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit , isn't it ? " said Hermione pleasantly . 
" Luna says her father's quite happy to take Harry's interview . 
Rita stared at them both for a moment , then let out a great whoop of laughter . 
" The Quibbler ! " she said , cackling . 
" But the Daily Prophet's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it . 
I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn't a better explanation of what happened , and if there's an alternative story available , even if it is published in a - " she glanced sideways at Luna , " in a - well , an unusual magazine - I think they might be rather keen to read it . " 
" They do it because it's an honor and , of course , to see their names in print . " 
Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione . 
" I'm supposed to do this for free ? " 
" Well , yes , " said Hermione calmly , taking a sip of her drink . 
" Otherwise , as you very well know , I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus . 
Of course , the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban . " 
" I don't suppose I ' ve got any choice , have I ? " said Rita , her voice shaking slightly . 
She opened her crocodile bag once more , withdrew a piece of parchment , and raised her Quick - Quotes Quill . 
" Daddy will be pleased , " said Luna brightly . 
A muscle twitched in Rita's jaw . 
" Okay , Harry ? " said Hermione , turning to him . 
" Ready to tell the public the truth ? " 
" I suppose , " said Harry , watching Rita balancing the Quick - Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them . 
" Fire away , then , Rita , " said Hermione serenely , fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass . 
Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler , that her father was expecting a " ' lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple - Horned Snorkacks , ' " - " and of course , that ' ll be a very important story , so Harrys might have to wait for the following issue , " said Luna . 
Rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember , knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth . 
He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane , not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple - Horned Snorkacks . 
But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to dosomething , whether or not it worked … 
Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on Dean's other side , but Harry knew he was listening . 
" It's the right thing to do , Harry , " said Neville , who was sitting opposite him . 
He was rather pale , but went on in a low voice , " It must have been … tough … talking about it … was it ? " 
Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato . 
Seamus looked up , but when he caught Harrys eye he looked quickly back at his plate again . 
After a while , Dean , Seamus and Neville departed for the common room , leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron , who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice . 
Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her friend Marietta . 
Harry's stomach gave an unpleasant lurch , but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table , and sat down with her back to him . 
" Oh , I forgot to ask you , " said Hermione brightly , glancing over at the Ravenclaw table , " what happened on your date with Cho ? How come you were back so early ? " 
" Er … well , it was … " said Harry , pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds , " a complete fiasco , now you mention it . " 
And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot's teashop . 
He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione . 
" I mean , what was all that about ? 
What was going on ? " 
Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho's head and sighed . 
" Oh , Harry " she said sadly . 
" Well , I'm sorry , but you were a bit tactless . " 
" Me , tactless ? " said Harry , outraged . 
" One minute we were getting on fine , next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid teashop - how was I supposed to feel about that ? " 
" Well , you see , " said Hermione , with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an over - emotional toddler , " you shouldn't have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date . " 
" But , but , " spluttered Harry , " but - you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along , how was I supposed to do that without telling her ? " " You should have told her differently , " said Hermione , still with that maddeningly patient air . 
" You should have said it was really annoying , but I'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks , and you really didn't want to go , you'd much rather spend the whole day with her , but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please , please come along with you and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly . 
" But I don't think you ' re ugly , " said Harry , bemused . 
Hermione laughed . 
" Harry you ' re worse than Ron … well , no , you ' re not , " she sighed , as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy . 
" Look - you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me , so she tried to make you jealous . 
" Is that what she was doing ? " said Harry , as Ron dropped on to the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him . 
" Well , wouldn't it have been easier if she'd just asked me whether I liked her better than you ? " 
" Girls don't often ask questions like that , " said Hermione . 
" Well , they should ! " said Harry forcefully . 
" I'm not saying what she did was sensible , " said Hermione , as Ginny joined them , just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled . 
" I'm just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time . " 
" You should write a book , " Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes , " translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry fervently , looking over at the Ravenclaw table . 
Cho had just got up , and , still not looking at him , she left the Great Hall . 
Feeling rather depressed , he looked back at Ron and Ginny . 
" It was a nightmare , " said Ron in a surly voice . 
" Oh come on , " said Hermione , looking at Ginny , " I'm sure it wasn't that - " 
" Yes , it was , " said Ginny . 
" It was appalling . 
Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it . " 
Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner ; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework . 
Harry had been struggling with a new star - chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up . 
" Ron and Ginny not here ? " 
asked Fred , looking around as he pulled up a chair , and when Harry shook his head , he said , " Good . 
They're complete rubbish without us . " 
" Come on , Ginny's not bad , " said George fairly , sitting down next to Fred . 
" Actually , I dunno how she got so good , seeing how we never let her play with us . " 
" She's been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren't looking , " said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books . 
" Oh , " said George , looking mildly impressed . 
" Has Ron saved a goal yet ? " asked Hermione , peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms . 
" So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday . " 
He got up again and moved restlessly to the window , staring out across the dark grounds . 
" You know , Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for . " 
Hermione cast him a stern look . 
" Told you already , we ' re not fussed about NEWTs , " said Fred . " The Snackboxes are ready to roll , we found out how to get rid of those boils , just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts them , Lee put us on to it . " 
George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky . 
" I dunno if I even want to watch this match . 
If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself . " 
" Kill him , more like , " said Fred firmly . 
" That's the trouble with Quidditch , " said Hermione absent - mindedly , once again bent over her Runes translation , " it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses . " 
She looked up to find her copy of Spellman's Syllabary , and caught Fred , George and Harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces . 
" Well , it does ! " 
she said impatiently . 
" It's only a game , isn't it ? " 
" Hermione , " said Harry , shaking his head , " you ' re good on feelings and stuff , but you just don't understand about Quidditch . " 
" Maybe not , " she said darkly , returning to her translation , " but at least my happiness doesn't depend on Ron's goalkeeping ability . " 
And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her , by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either . 
The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short ; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty - two minutes of agony . 
It was hard to say what the worst thing was : Harry thought it was a close - run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save , Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat , and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle . 
The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points : Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose , so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty . 
" Good catch , " Harry told Ginny back in the common room , where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral . 
" I was lucky , " she shrugged . 
" It wasn't a very fast Snitch and Summerby's got a cold , he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment . 
Anyway , once you ' re back on the team - " 
" You ' re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school , " Ginny corrected him . 
" There's a difference . 
Anyway , once you ' re back , I think I ' ll try out for Chaser . 
Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal - scoring to Seeking anyway . " 
Harry looked over at Ron , who was hunched in a corner , staring at his knees , a bottle of Butterbeer clutched in his hand . 
" Angelina still won't let him resign , " Ginny said , as though reading Harry's mind . 
Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron , but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team . 
Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of Weasley is our King sung with great gusto by the Slytherins , who were now favorites to win the Quidditch Cup . 
Fred and George wandered over . 
" I haven't even got the heart to take the mickey out of him , " said Fred , looking over at Ron's crumpled figure . 
" - well , I ' ll save it for parties , eh ? " 
Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this . 
Out of respect for his feelings , Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself , so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to . 
Harry got into bed , thinking about the match . 
He was quite impressed by Ginny's performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner … there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke's ankle ; if Ginny hadn't hesitated , she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor . 
Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione . 
The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark . 
After a few minutes , however , he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept , as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson . 
He tried for a moment or two , but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them . 
Slowly , Ron's snores died away , to be replaced by the sound of deep , slow breathing . 
It took Harry much longer to get to sleep ; his body was tired , but it took his brain a long time to close down . 
He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes . 
He watched them happily for a while , then decided to go and find the other members of the D . A .. 
But when he left the room he found himself facing , not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy , but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall . 
He turned his head slowly to the left . 
There , at the far end of the windowless passage , was a plain , black door . 
He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last , and find the way to open it … he was feet from it , and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right - hand side … the door was ajar … he stretched out his hand to push it wide and - 
Ron gave a loud , rasping , genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness , to open a door that was hundreds of miles away . 
He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt . 
He knew he should not have seen the door , but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron … if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute . 
They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning . 
Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet : nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters , who , despite many reported sightings , had still not been caught . 
She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice ; as he had only received one note during the entire year , he was sure , when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him , that it had made a mistake . 
" Who ' re you after ? " he asked it , languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the recipient's name and address : 
Harry Potter , Great Hall , Hogwarts School 
Frowning , he made to take the letter from the owl , but before he could do so , three , four , five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position , treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first . 
" What's going on ? " Ron asked in amazement , as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones , screeching , hooting and flapping their wings . 
" Harry ! " said Hermione breathlessly , plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long , cylindrical package . 
" I think I know what this means - open this one first ! " 
Harry ripped off the brown packaging . 
Out rolled a tightly furled copy of the March edition of The Quibbler . 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover . 
In large red letters across this picture were the words : 
" It's good , isn't it ? " said Luna , who had drifted o ver to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between Fred and Ron . 
" It came out yesterday , I asked Dad to send you a free copy . 
I expect all these , " she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry , " are letters from readers . " 
" That's what I thought , " said Hermione eagerly . 
" Harry , d ' you mind if we - ? " 
" Help yourself , " said Harry , feeling slightly bemused . 
Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes . 
" This one's from a bloke who thinks you ' re off your rocker , " said Ron , glancing down his letter . 
" Ah well … " 
" This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St . Mungo's , " said Hermione , looking disappointed and crumpling up a second . 
" This one looks okay , though , " said Harry slowly , scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley . 
" Hey , she says she believes me ! " 
" Here's another one you ' ve convinced , Harry ! " said Hermione excitedly . 
" Having read your side of the story , I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly … little though I want to think that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has returned , I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth … Oh , this is wonderful ! " 
" Another one who thinks you ' re barking , " said Ron , throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder " … but this one says you ' ve got her converted and she now thinks you ' re a real hero - she's put in a photograph , too - wow ! " 
" What is going on here ? " said a falsely sweet , girlish voice . 
Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes . 
Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna , her bulging toad's eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry . 
Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly . 
" Why have you got all these letters , Mr . Potter ? " 
she asked slowly . 
" Is that a crime now ? " said Fred loudly . 
" Be careful , Mr . Weasley , or I shall have to put you in detention , " said Umbridge . 
Harry hesitated , but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet ; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridges attention . 
" People have written to me because I gave an interview , " said Harry . 
" About what happened to me last June . " 
For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this . 
Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before , but when he looked towards the Headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick . 
repeated Umbridge , her voice thinner and higher than ever . 
" What do you mean ? " 
" I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them , " said Harry . 
And he threw the copy of The Quibbler to her . 
She caught it and stared down at the cover . 
Her pale , doughy face turned an ugly , patchy violet . 
" When did you do this ? " she asked , her voice trembling slightly . 
" Last Hogsmeade weekend , " said Harry . 
She looked up at him , incandescent with rage , the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers . 
" There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you , Mr . Potter , " she whispered . 
" How you dare … how you could … " She took a deep breath . 
" I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies . 
The message , apparently , has still not sunk in . 
She stalked away , clutching The Quibbler to her chest , the eyes of many students following her . 
By mid - morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school , not just on house noticeboards , but in the corridors and classrooms too . 
BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS 
Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quibbler will be expelled . 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty - seven . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , High Inquisitor 
For some reason , every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure . 
" What exactly are you so happy about ? " 
Harry asked her . 
" Oh , Harry , don't you see ? " Hermione breathed . 
" If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview , it was banning it ! " 
And it seemed that Hermione was quite right . 
By the end of the day , though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school , the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other . 
Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes , discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons , while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls ' toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes . 
" Then they spotted me , and obviously they know I know you , so they bombarded me with questions , " Hermione told Harry , her eyes shining , " and Harry , I think they believe you , I really do , I think you ' ve finally got them convinced ! " 
Meanwhile , Professor Umbridge was stalking the school , stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets : Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler , but the students were several steps ahead of her . 
Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it . 
The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty - six , but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same . 
Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can ; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of Charms , said , " Shh ! " and hurried away ; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class , and a very disapproving Umbridge , that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all , but would live to a ripe old age , become Minister for Magic and have twelve children . 
But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day . 
Before he knew what had happened , her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear , " I'm really , really sorry . 
He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it , but very glad they were on speaking terms again , and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again . 
" I just wanted to say , " he mumbled , squinting at Harry's left knee , " I believe you . 
And I ' ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam . " 
If anything more was needed to complete Harry's happiness , it was the reaction he got from Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library ; they were with a weedy - looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott . 
They looked round at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment : Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe . 
Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this : he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters . 
" And the best bit , " whispered Hermione gleefully , as they left the library , " is they can't contradict you , because they can't admit they ' ve read the article ! " 
Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night . 
Daringly , Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall , so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings , occasionally saying things like ' THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS ' and ' EAT DUNG , UMBRIDGE ' in a booming voice . 
Hermione did not find this very amusing ; she said it interfered with her concentration , and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation . 
Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two , especially when the talking spell had started to wear off , so that it merely shouted disconnected words like ' DUNG ' and ' UMBRIDGE ' at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice . 
In fact , it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again . 
To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him , asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time , he announced that he too needed an early night . 
The dormitory was empty when he reached it . 
He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed ; it felt soothing against his scar . 
He rolled over on to his side , closed his eyes , and fell asleep almost at once … 
He was standing in a dark , curtained room lit by a single branch of candles . 
His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him . 
They were long - fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large , pale spiders against the dark velvet of the chair . 
Beyond the chair , in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles , knelt a man in black robes . 
" I have been badly advised , it seems , " said Harry , in a high , cold voice that pulsed with anger . 
" Master , I crave your pardon , " croaked the man kneeling on the floor . 
The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight . 
He seemed to be trembling . 
" I do not blame you , Rookwood , " said Harry in that cold , cruel voice . 
He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it , closer to the man cowering on the floor , until he stood directly over him in the darkness , looking down from a far greater height than usual . 
asked Harry . 
" Yes , My Lord , yes … I used to work in the Department after - after all … " 
" Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it . " 
" Bode could never have taken it , Master … Bode would have known he could not … undoubtedly , that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse … " 
" Stand up , Rookwood , " whispered Harry . 
His face was pockmarked ; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight . 
" You have done well to tell me this , " said Harry . 
" Very well … I have wasted months on fruitless schemes , it seems … but no matter … we begin again , from now . 
You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude , Rookwood … " 
" I shall need your help . 
I shall need all the information you can give me . " 
" Of course , My Lord , of course … anything … " 
" Very well … you may go . 
Rookwood scurried backwards , bowing , and disappeared through a door . 
Left alone in the dark room , Harry turned towards the wall . 
A cracked , age - spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows . 
Harry moved towards it . 
His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness … a face whiter than a skull … red eyes with slits for pupils … 
Harry flailed around madly , became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed . 
For a few seconds he did not know where he was ; he was convinced he was about to see the white , skulllike face looming at him out of the dark again , then very near to him Ron's voice spoke . 
" Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here ! " 
Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight , flat on his back , his scar searing with pain . 
Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed ; one arm was out of his robes . 
" Has someone been attacked again ? " asked Ron , pulling Harry roughly to his feet . 
Is it that snake ? " 
" No - everyone's fine - " gasped Harry , whose forehead felt as though it were on fire . 
" Well … Avery isn't … he's in trouble … he gave him the wrong information … Voldemort's really angry " 
Harry groaned and sank , shaking , on to his bed , rubbing his scar . 
" What are you talking about ? " said Ron , sounding scared . 
" D ' you mean … did you just see You - Know - Who ? " 
" I was You - Know - Who , " said Harry , and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face , to check that they were no longer deathly white and long - fingered . 
" He was with Rookwood , he's one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban , remember ? 
Rookwood's just told him Bode couldn't have done it . " 
" Done what ? " 
" Remove something … he said Bode would have known he couldn't have done it … Bode was under the Imperius Curse … I think he said Malfoy's dad put it on him . " 
Ron said . 
" But - Harry , that's got to be - " 
" The weapon , " Harry finished the sentence for him . 
" I know " 
The dormitory door opened ; Dean and Seamus came in . 
Harry swung his legs back into bed . 
He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened , seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter . 
" Did you say , " murmured Ron , putting his head close to Harry's on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table , " that you were You - Know - Who ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry quietly . 
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water ; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest . 
" Harry , " he said , as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily , pulling off their robes and talking , " you ' ve got to tell - " 
" I wouldn't have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency . 
I'm supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out . 
That's what they want . " 
He got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron's mattress creak as he , too , lay back down . 
Somewhere , he knew , Avery was being punished . 
Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened ; they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard . 
Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard , Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember . 
When he had finished , she said nothing at all for a few moments , but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George , who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard . 
" So that's why they killed him , " she said quietly , withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last . 
" When Bode tried to steal this weapon , something funny happened to him . 
I think there must be defensive spells on it , or around it , to stop people touching it . 
But remember what the Healer told us ? 
He was recovering . 
I mean , the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift . 
Once he'd got his voice back , he'd explain what he'd been doing , wouldn't he ? 
They would have known he'd been sent to steal the weapon . 
Of course , it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him . 
" In the - hang on … " he said slowly . 
" He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day ! 
Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing , but what if - " 
" Sturgis ! " gasped Hermione , looking thunderstruck . 
" Sorry ? " said Ron , looking bewildered . 
" Sturgis Podmore - " said Hermione breathlessly , " arrested for trying to get through a door ! 
Lucius Malfoy must have got him too ! 
I bet he did it the day you saw him there , Harry . 
Sturgis had Moody's Invisibility Cloak , right ? 
So , what if he was standing guard by the door , invisible , and Malfoy heard him move - or guessed someone was there - or just did the Imperius Curse on the off - chance there'd be a guard there ? 
So , when Sturgis next had an opportunity - probably when it was his turn on guard duty again - he tried to get into the Department to steal the weapon for Voldemort - Ron , be quiet - but he got caught and sent to Azkaban … " 
She gazed at Harry . 
" And now Rookwood's told Voldemort how to get the weapon ? " 
" I didn't hear all the conversation , but that's what it sounded like , " said Harry . 
" Rookwood used to work there … maybe Voldemort ' ll send Rookwood to do it ? " 
Hermione nodded , apparently still lost in thought . 
Then , quite abruptly , she said , " But you shouldn't have seen this at all , Harry . " 
" What ? " he said , taken aback . 
" You ' re supposed to be learning how to close your m ind to this sort of thing , " said Hermione , suddenly stern . 
" I know I am , " said Harry . 
" But - " 
" Well , I think we should just try and forget what you saw , " said Hermione firmly . 
Harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day , which proved to be another bad one . 
When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors , they were laughing at Gryffindor's abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff ; the Slytherins were singing Weasley is our King so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation . 
The week did not improve as it progressed . 
Harry received two more D's in Potions ; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack ; and he couldn't stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort - though he didn't bring it up with Ron and Hermione again ; he didn't want another telling - off from Hermione . 
He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it , but that was out of the question , so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind . 
Unfortunately , the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been . 
" Get up , Potter . " 
A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood , Harry was to be found , yet again , kneeling on the floor of Snape's office , trying to clear his head . 
" That last memory , " said Snape . 
" What was it ? " 
" I don't know , " said Harry , getting wearily to his feet . 
He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth . 
" You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet ? " 
" No , " said Snape softly . 
" I mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room … " 
" It's … nothing , " said Harry . 
Snape's dark eyes bored into Harry's . 
Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency , Harry blinked and looked away . 
" How do that man and that room come to be inside your head , Potter ? " said Snape . 
" It - " said Harry , looking everywhere but at Snape , " it was - just a dream I had . " 
" A dream ? " repeated Snape . 
There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid . 
" You do know why we are here , don't you , Potter ? " said Snape , in a low , dangerous voice . 
" Yes , " said Harry stiffly . 
" Remind me why we are here , Potter . " 
" So I can learn Occlumency , " said Harry , now glaring at a dead eel . 
" Correct , Potter . 
And dim though you may be - " Harry looked back at Snape , hating him " - I would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress . 
How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had ? " 
" Just that one , " lied Harry . 
Maybe they make you feel special - important ? " 
" No , they don't , " said Harry , his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand . 
" That is just as well , Potter , " said Snape coldly , " because you are neither special nor important , and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters . " 
" No - that's your job , isn't it ? " 
Harry shot at him . 
For a long moment they stared at each other , Harry convinced he had gone too far . 
" Yes , Potter , " he said , his eyes glinting . 
" That is my job . 
Now , if you are ready , we will start again . " 
He raised his wand : " One — two - three - Legilimens ! " 
A hundred Dementors were swooping towards Harry across the lake in the grounds … he screwed up his face in concentration … they were coming closer … he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods … yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him , his eyes fixed on Harry's face , muttering under his breath … and somehow , Snape was growing clearer , and the Dementors were growing fainter … 
Harry raised his own wand . 
" Protego ! " 
Snape staggered - his wand flew upwards , away from Harry - and suddenly Harry's mind was teeming with memories that were not his : a hook - nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman , while a small dark - haired boy cried in a corner … a greasy - haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom , pointing his wand at the ceiling , shooting down flies … a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick - 
Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest ; he staggered several steps backwards , hit some of the shelves covering Snape's walls and heard something crack . 
Snape was shaking slightly , and was very white in the face . 
The back of Harry's robes was damp . 
One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it ; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion . 
" Reparo , " hissed Snape , and the jar sealed itself at once . 
" Well , Potter … that was certainly an improvement … " Panting slightly , Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson , almost as though he was checking they were still there . 
" I don't remember telling you to use a Shield Charm … but there is no doubt that it was effective … " 
Harry did not speak ; he felt that to say anything might be dangerous . 
He was sure he had just broken into Snape's memories , that he had just seen scenes from Snape's childhood . 
It was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes . 
" Let's try again , shall we ? " said Snape . 
Harry felt a thrill of dread ; he was about to pay for what had just happened , he was sure of it . 
They moved back into position with the desk between them , Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time . 
" On the count of three , then , " said Snape , raising his wand once more . 
" One - two - " Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before Snape cried , " Legilimens ! " 
He was hurtling along the corridor towards the Department of Mysteries , past the blank stone walls , past the torches - the plain black door was growing ever larger ; he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it , he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light - The door had flown open ! 
He was through it at last , inside a black - walled , black - floored circular room lit with blue - flamed candles , and there were more doors all around him - he needed to go on - but which door ought he to take - ? 
" POTTER ! " 
Harry opened his eyes . 
He was flat on his back again with no memory of having gotten there ; he was also panting as though he really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor , really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room . 
" Explain yourself ! " said Snape , who was standing over him , looking furious . 
" I … dunno what happened , " said Harry truthfully , st anding up . 
There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish . 
" I ' ve never seen that before . 
I mean , I told you , I ' ve dreamed about the door … but it's never opened before " 
" You are not working hard enough ! " 
For some reason , Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before , when Harry had seen into his teacher's memories . 
" You are lazy and sloppy , Potter , it is small wonder that the Dark Lord - " 
" Can you tell me something , sir ? " said Harry , firing up again . 
" Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord ? 
I ' ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that . " 
Snape opened his mouth in a snarl - and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room . 
Snapes head jerked upwards ; he was gazing at the ceiling . 
" What the - ? " he muttered . 
Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the Entrance Hall . 
Snape looked round at him , frowning . 
" Did you see anything unusual on your way down here , Potter ? " 
Harry shook his head . 
Somewhere above them , the woman screamed again . 
Snape strode to his office door , his wand still held at the ready , and swept out of sight . 
Harry hesitated for a moment , then followed . 
The screams were indeed coming from the Entrance Hall ; they grew louder as Harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons . 
When he reached the top he found the Entrance Hall packed ; students had come flooding out of the Great Hall , where dinner was still in progress , to see what was going on ; others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase . 
Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring , some of them looking shocked , others even frightened . 
Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the Hall ; she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick . 
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Entrance Hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other , looking utterly mad . 
Her hair was sticking up on end , her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other ; her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders , giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams . 
Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her , one of them upsidedown ; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her . 
Professor Trelawney was staring , apparently terrified , at something Harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs . 
" NO ! 
" Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow's weather , you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections , and lack of any improvement , would make it inevitable that you would be sacked ? " 
" You c - can't ! " howled Professor Trelawney , tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses , " you c - can't sack me ! 
I ' ve b - been here sixteen years ! 
H - Hogwarts is in - my h - home ! " 
" It was your home , " said Professor Umbridge , and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink , sobbing uncontrollably , on to one of her trunks , " until an hour ago , when the Minister of Magic countersigned your Order of Dismissal . 
You are embarrassing us . " 
But she stood and watched , with an expression of gloating enjoyment , as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned , rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief . 
Harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around . 
Lavender and Parvati were both crying quietly , their arms round each other . 
Then he heard footsteps . 
Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators , marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes . 
" There , there , Sibyll … calm down … blow your nose on this … it's not as bad as you think , now … you are not going to have to leave Hogwarts … " 
" Oh really , Professor McGonagall ? " said Umbridge in a deadly voice , taking a few steps forward . 
Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance . 
What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine , but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night . 
Leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney , tear - stained and trembling , on her trunk , Professor McGonagall alongside her . 
" Yours , Professor Dumbledore ? " said Umbridge , with a singularly unpleasant little laugh . 
" I'm afraid you do not understand the position . 
I have here - " she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes " - an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic . 
Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty - three , the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect , place upon probation and sack any teacher she - that is to say , I - feel is not performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic . 
I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch . 
I have dismissed her . " 
To Harry's very great surprise , Dumbledore continued to smile . 
He looked down at Professor Trelawney , who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk , and said , " You are quite right , of course , Professor Umbridge . 
As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers . 
You do not , however , have the authority to send them away from the castle . 
I am afraid , " he went on , with a courteous little bow , " that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster , and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts . " 
I sh - shall - leave Hogwarts and s - seek my fortune elsewhere - " 
" No , " said Dumbledore sharply . 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
" Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs , Professor McGonagall ? " 
" Of course , " said McGonagall . " Up you get , Sibyll … " 
Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney's other arm . 
Together , they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs . 
Professor Trelawney's luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her , Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear . 
Professor Umbridge was standing stock still , staring at Dumbledore , who continued to smile benignly . 
" The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if - and only if - the Headmaster is unable to find one , " said Dumbledore . " And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded . 
May I introduce you ? " 
Harry heard hooves . 
There was a shocked murmur around the Hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards , some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer . 
Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark , dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest : white - blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes ; the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse . 
" I think you ' ll find him suitable . " 
" I ' ll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now , don't you , Hermione ? " 
It was breakfast time , two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney , and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon . 
She turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns . 
" He's not a horse , he's a centaur ! " said Lavender , sounding shocked . 
" How is she ? " asked Harry . 
You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . " 
After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class as Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the Entrance Hall , heading for Divination . 
" Aren't we going up to North Tower ? " asked Ron , looking puzzled , as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase . 
Parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder . 
" How d ' you expect Firenze to climb that ladder ? 
Classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the Entrance Hall from the opposite side to the Great Hall . 
Harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never used regularly , and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom . 
When he entered it right behind Ron , and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing , he was therefore momentarily stunned . 
" What the - ? " 
The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it ; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows , so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft , dappled , green light . 
The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders , arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests , and all looking rather nervous . 
In the middle of the clearing , where there were no trees , stood Firenze . 
" Harry Potter , " he said , holding out a hand when Harry entered . 
" Er - good to see you . " 
As he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground , he saw they were all looking at him in awe , apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze , whom they seemed to find intimidating . 
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket , Firenze gestured around the room . 
" It is not a question of your bravery , " said Firenze , " but of my position . 
I cannot return to the 
" Herd ? " said Lavender in a confused voice , and Harry knew she was thinking of cows . 
Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean , who seemed to realize at once that he had said something very offensive . 
" I didn't - I meant - sorry " he finished in a hushed voice . 
" Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore , " said Firenze . 
Harry remembered how , nearly four years ago , the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety on his back ; he had called him a ' common mule ' . 
He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest . 
He swished his long palomino tail , raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead , then lowered it slowly , and as he did so , the light in the room dimmed , so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight , and stars appeared on the ceiling . 
There were oohs and gasps and Ron said audibly , " Blimey ! " 
" Lie back on the floor , " said Firenze in his calm voice , " and observe the heavens . 
Here is written , for those who can see , the fortune of our races . " 
Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling . 
" I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy , " said Firenze's calm voice , " and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens . 
Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries . 
" These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe , and are unaffected by planetary movements . " 
" - is a human , " said Firenze simply . 
Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati . 
" Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen , I do not know , " continued Firenze , and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them , " but she wastes her time , in the main , on the self - flattering nonsense humans call fortune - telling . 
I , however , am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs , which is impersonal and impartial . 
We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there . 
Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry . 
" In the past decade , the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars . 
How soon , centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves , by the observation of fume and flame … " 
It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended . 
They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor , and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes , but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described , telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this , that it took centaurs years and years to become competent , and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things , anyway , because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly . 
He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had . 
His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew , but rather to impress upon them that nothing , not even centaurs ' knowledge , was foolproof . 
" He's not very definite on anything , is he ? " said Ron in a low voice , as they put out their mallowsweet fire . 
" I mean , I could do with a few more details about this war we ' re about to have , couldn't you ? " 
The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped ; Harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle , and quite convinced that he was really in the Forest . 
Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called , " Harry Potter , a word , please . " 
Harry turned . 
Ron hesitated . 
" Harry Potter , you are a friend of Hagrid's , are you not ? " said the centaur . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
He would do better to abandon it . " 
Harry repeated blankly . 
" I would warn Hagrid myself , but I am banished - it would be unwise for me to go too near the Forest now - Hagrid has troubles enough , without a centaurs ' battle . " 
" But - what's Hagrid attempting to do ? " said Harry nervously . 
Firenze surveyed Harry impassively . 
" Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service , " said Firenze , " and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures . 
I shall not betray his secret . 
The attempt is not working . 
Tell him , Harry Potter . 
Good - day to you . " 
The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated . 
As a dull March blurred into a squally April , his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again . 
At last , Harry had managed it by pretending he'd lost his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , and doubling back after class one day . 
When he'd repeated Firenzes words , Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy , blackened eyes , apparently taken aback . 
" Nice bloke , Firenze , " he said gruffly , " but he don ' know what he's talkin ' abou ' on this . 
The attemp's comin ' on fine . " 
" Because you ' ve got to be careful , Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and , if you ask me , she's on a roll . 
If you ' re doing anything you shouldn't be , you ' ll be - " 
" There's things more importan'than keepin ' a job , " said Hagrid , though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of Knarl droppings crashed to the floor . 
Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor , but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle . 
Meanwhile , as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them , the OWLs were drawing ever nearer . 
All the fifth - years were suffering from stress to some degree , but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now . 
If it had not been for the D . A . lessons , Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy . 
He sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement , working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time , swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow D . A . members and saw how far they had come . 
Indeed , Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the D . A . received ' Outstanding ' in their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWLs . 
" They're not supposed to be pretty , they ' re supposed to protect you , " said Harry patiently . 
" What we really need is a Boggart or something ; that's how I learned , I had to conjure a Patronus while the Boggart was pretending to be a Dementor - " 
" And I still - can't - do it ! " 
" Harry , I think I'm doing it " ' yelled Seamus , who had been brought along to his first ever D . A . meeting by Dean . 
" Look - ah - it's gone … but it was definitely something hairy , Harry ! " 
The door of the Room of Requirement opened , and closed . 
Harry looked round to see who had entered , but there did not seem to be anybody there . 
It was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent . 
Next thing he knew , something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee . 
He looked down and saw , to his very great astonishment , Dobby the house - elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats . 
" What are you - What's wrong ? " 
The members of the D . A . closest to Harry had fallen silent ; everybody in the room was watching Dobby . 
" Harry Potter , sir … " squeaked the elf , trembling from head to foot , " Harry Potter , sir … Dobby has come to warn you … but the house - elves have been warned not to tell … " 
Harry , who had some experience of Dobbys habits of self punishment , made to seize him , but Dobby merely bounced off the stone , cushioned by his eight hats . 
Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy . 
" What's happened , Dobby ? " 
Harry asked , grabbing the elf's tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself . 
" Harry Potter … she … she … " 
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist . 
Harry seized that , too . 
" Umbridge ? " asked Harry , horrified . 
Dobby nodded , then tried to bang his head on Harry's knees . 
Harry held him at arm's length . 
" What about her ? Dobby - she hasn't found out about this - about us - about the D . A . ? " 
He read the answer in the elf's stricken face . 
His hands held fast by Harry , the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor . 
" Is she coming ? " 
Harry asked quietly . 
" Yes , Harry Potter , yes ! " 
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless , terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf . 
Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories . 
It was only ten to nine ; if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery , which were both nearer - 
" Harry , come on ! " shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out . 
He scooped up Dobby , who was still attempting to do himself serious injury , and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue . 
" Dobby - this is an order - get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and , if she asks you whether you warned me , lie and say no ! " said Harry . 
" And I forbid you to hurt yourself ! " he added , dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him . 
Harry glanced left and right , the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished ; he started to run right ; there was a boys ' bathroom up ahead , he could pretend he'd been in there all the time if he could just reach it - 
Someone behind him was laughing . 
He rolled over on to his back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon - shaped vase . 
" Hey Professor - PROFESSOR ! 
I ' ve got one ! " 
" It's him ! " she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor . 
I ' ll take him from here … stand up , Potter ! " 
Harry got to his feet , glaring at the pair of them . 
" Tell the others to look in the library - anybody out of breath - check the bathrooms , Miss Parkinson can do the girls ' ones - off you go - and you , " she added in her softest , most dangerous voice , as Malfoy walked away , " you can come with me to the Headmasters office , Potter . " 
Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught . 
He thought of Ron - Mrs . Weasley would kill him - and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her OWLs . 
" Fizzing Whizzbee , " sang Umbridge ; the stone gargoyle jumped aside , the wall behind split open , and they ascended the moving stone staircase . 
They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker , but Umbridge did not bother to knock , she strode straight inside , still holding tight to Harry . 
The office was full of people . 
Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk , his expression serene , the tips of his long fingers together . 
Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him , her face extremely tense . 
Cornelius Fudge , Minister for Magic , was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire , apparently immensely pleased with the situation ; Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough - looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognize , were positioned on either side of the door like guards , and the freckled , bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall , a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands , apparently poised to take notes . 
All of them were alert and serious , watching what was happening below them . 
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them . 
Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face . 
" Well , " he said . 
Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster . 
" He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower , " said Umbridge . 
There was an indecent excitement in her voice , the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the Entrance Hall . 
" Did he , did he ? " said Fudge appreciatively . 
Well , Potter … I expect you know why you are here ? " 
Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant ' yes ' : his mouth had opened and the word was half - formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore's face . 
Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry - his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder - but as Harry stared at him , he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side . 
" Ye — no . " 
" I beg your pardon ? " said Fudge . 
" No , " said Harry , firmly . 
" No , I don't , " said Harry . 
Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge . 
Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore , who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink . 
" So you have no idea , " said Fudge , in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm , " why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office ? 
You are not aware that you have broken any school rules ? " 
" School rules ? " said Harry . 
" No . " 
" Not that I'm aware of , " said Harry blandly . 
His heart was still hammering very fast . 
It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudges blood pressure rising , but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them ; if somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the D . A . then he , the leader , might as well be packing his trunk right now . 
" Yes , it is , " said Harry , hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face . 
" Yes , yes , do , " said Fudge , nodding , and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room . 
There was a wait of several minutes , in which nobody looked at each other , then Harry heard the door open behind him . 
Umbridge moved past him into the room , gripping by the shoulder Cho's curly - haired friend , Marietta , who was hiding her face in her hands . 
" Don't be scared , dear , don't be frightened , " said Professor Umbridge softly , patting her on the back , " it's quite all right , now . 
You have done the right thing . 
The Minister is very pleased with you . 
" Marietta's mother , Minister , " she added , looking up at Fudge , " is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation , Floo Network office - she's been helping us police the Hogwarts fires , you know . " 
" Jolly good , jolly good ! " said Fudge heartily . 
As Marietta raised her head , Fudge leapt backwards in shock , nearly landing himself in the fire . 
He cursed , and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke . 
Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes , but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close - set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word SNEAK . 
She hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said , " Well , Minister , Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me . 
She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor , sometimes known as the Room of Requirement , I would find out something to my advantage . 
I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there . 
Unfortunately , at that point this hex , " she waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face , " came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more . " 
You did exactly the right thing . 
Now , will you tell me what happened at this meeting ? 
What was its purpose ? 
Who was there ? " 
But Marietta would not speak ; she merely shook her head again , her eyes wide and fearful . 
" You will remember , Minister , that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade - " 
" I have testimony from Willy Widdershins , Minerva , who happened to be in the bar at the time . 
" He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - " 
" Blatant corruption ! " roared the portrait of the corpulent , red - nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk . 
" The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day , no sir , they did not ! " 
" The purpose of Potter's meeting with these students , " continued Professor Umbridge , " was to persuade them to join an illegal society , whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school - age - " 
Harry stared at him . 
He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one ; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it . 
" Oho ! " said Fudge , bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again . 
Or was it Potters identical twin in the Hog's Head that day ? 
Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time , a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors ? " 
" Oh , very good , Minister , very good ! " 
Then he saw , to his astonishment , that Dumbledore was smiling gently , too . 
" Cornelius , I do not deny - and nor , I am sure , does Harry - that he was in the Hog's Head that day , nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group . 
I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was , at that time , illegal . 
If you remember , the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harrys Hogsmeade meeting , so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head . " 
Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy . 
" That's all very fine , Headmaster , " she said , smiling sweetly , " but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty - four . 
" Well , " said Dumbledore , surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers , " they certainly would be , if they had continued after the Decree came into effect . 
Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued ? " 
As Dumbledore spoke , Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something . 
Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here ? " 
" Oh , can she tell us about six months ' worth of meetings ? " said Dumbledore , raising his eyebrows . 
" I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight . " 
" Miss Edgecombe , " said Umbridge at once , " tell us how long these meetings have been going on , dear . 
You can simply nod or shake your head , I'm sure that won't make the spots worse . 
" Just nod or shake your head , dear , " Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta , " come on , now , that won't re - activate the jinx . " 
Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta's face . 
Only her eyes were visible between the pulled - up robes and her curly fringe . 
Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight , but her eyes looked oddly blank . 
And then - to Harry's utter amazement - Marietta shook her head . 
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge , then back at Marietta . 
" I don't think you understood the question , did you , dear ? 
I'm asking whether you ' ve been going to these meetings for the past six months ? 
Again , Marietta shook her head . 
" I would have thought her meaning was quite clear , " said Professor McGonagall harshly , " there have been no secret meetings for the past six months . 
" But there was a meeting tonight ! " said Umbridge furiously . 
" There was a meeting , Miss Edgecombe , you told me about it , in the Room of Requirement ! 
And Potter was the leader , was he not , Potter organized it , Potter - why are you shaking your head , girl ? " 
" Well , usually when a person shakes their head , " said McGonagall coldly , " they mean ' no ' . 
Professor Umbridge seized Marietta , pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard . 
A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet , his wand raised ; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta , waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned . 
" I cannot allow you to manhandle my students , Dolores , " said Dumbledore and , for the first time , he looked angry . 
" You want to calm yourself , Madam Umbridge , " said Kingsley , in his deep , slow voice . 
" I mean , yes - you ' re right , Shacklebolt - I - I forgot myself . " 
She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge's sudden attack , nor relieved by her release ; she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her . 
A sudden suspicion , connected to Kingsley's whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him , sprang into Harry's mind . 
" Dolores , " said Fudge , with the air of trying to settle something once and for all , " the meeting tonight - the one we know definitely happened - " 
" Yes , " said Umbridge , pulling herself together , " yes … well , Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor , accompanied by certain trustworthy students , so as to catch those in the meeting red - handed . 
It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival , however , because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction . 
It does not matter , however . 
I have all their names here , Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind . 
And to Harry's horror , she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement's wall and handed it to Fudge . 
" The moment I saw Potter's name on the list , I knew what we were dealing with , " she said softly . 
He looked up at Dumbledore , who was still standing beside Marietta , his wand held loosely in his hand . 
" Dumbledore's Army . " 
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge . 
He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak . 
Then he looked up , smiling . 
" Well , the game is up , " he said simply . 
" Would you like a written confession from me , Cornelius - or will a statement before these witnesses suffice ? " 
Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other . 
There was fear in both faces . 
He did not understand what was going on , and nor , apparently , did Fudge . 
" Statement ? " said Fudge slowly . 
" What - I don't - ? " 
" Dumbledore's Army , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore , still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge's face . 
Dumbledore's Army . " 
" But - but - " 
He took a horrified step backwards , yelped , and jumped out of the fire again . 
" That's right , " said Dumbledore pleasantly . 
" You organized this ? " 
" I did , " said Dumbledore . 
I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe , of course . " 
Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore , his chest swelling . 
" That's right , " said Dumbledore cheerfully . 
" NO ! " shouted Harry . 
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him , McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly , but it had suddenly dawned on Harry what Dumbledore was about to do , and he could not let it happen . 
" No — Professor Dumbledore - ! " 
" Be quiet , Harry , or I am afraid you will have to leave my office , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
" It's like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon , isn't it ? " 
Percy dashed from the room , slamming the door behind him , and Fudge turned back to Dumbledore . 
" You will now be escorted back to the Ministry , where you will be formally charged , then sent to Azkaban to await trial ! " 
" I see no snag , Dumbledore ! " 
" Well , " said Dumbledore apologetically , " I'm afraid I do . " 
" Well - it's just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to - what is the phrase ? 
I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all , Cornelius . 
I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban . 
I could break out , of course - but what a waste of time , and frankly , I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing . " 
Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face , as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened . 
He made a small choking noise , then looked round at Kingsley and the man with short grey hair , who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far . 
The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little , away from the wall . 
Harry saw his hand drift , almost casually , towards his pocket . 
" I'm sure you are an excellent Auror - I seem to remember that you achieved ' Outstanding ' in all your NEWT s — but if you attempt to — er — bring me in by force , I will have to hurt you . " 
He looked towards Fudge again , but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next . 
" Merlin's beard , no , " said Dumbledore , smiling , " not unless you are foolish enough to force me to . " 
Shacklebolt ! 
Take him ! " 
A streak of silver light flashed around the room ; there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled ; a hand grabbed the scruff of Harry's neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off ; several of the portraits yelled , Fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air . 
Coughing in the dust , Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him ; there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried , " No ! " ; then there was the sound of breaking glass , frantically scuffling footsteps , a groan … and silence . 
Harry struggled around to see who was half - strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him ; she had forced both him and Marietta out of harm's way . 
Dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them . 
" Are you all right ? " 
" Yes ! " said Professor McGonagall , getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her . 
The dust was clearing . 
The wreckage of the office loomed into view : Dumbledore's desk had been overturned , all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor , their silver instruments in pieces . 
Fudge , Umbridge , Kingsley and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor . 
" Now , they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate - you must act as though no time has passed , as though they were merely knocked to the ground , they will not remember - " 
" Where will you go , Dumbledore ? " whispered Professor McGonagall . 
" Oh no , " said Dumbledore , with a grim smile , " I am not leaving to go into hiding . 
Fudge will soon wish he'd never dislodged me from Hogwarts , I promise you . " 
" Professor Dumbledore … " Harry began . 
He did not know what to say first : how sorry he was that he had started the D . A . in the first place and caused all this trouble , or how terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion ? 
But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word . 
" Listen to me , Harry , " he said urgently . 
" You must study Occlumency as hard as you can , do you understand me ? 
Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams - you will understand why soon enough , but you must promise me - " 
Dumbledore seized Harry's wrist . 
But as Dumbledore's fingers closed over Harrys skin , a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible , snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore , to bite him , to hurt him - 
" - you will understand , " whispered Dumbledore . 
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him . 
Dumbledore released Harry , raised his hand and grasped the phoenix's long golden tail . 
There was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone . 
" Where is he ? " 
" The stairs ! " cried Dawlish , and he flung himself upon the door , wrenched it open and disappeared , followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge . 
There was a long and painful silence . 
" Well , Minerva , " said Fudge nastily , straightening his torn shirtsleeve , " I'm afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore . " 
" You think so , do you ? " said Professor McGonagall scornfully . 
Fudge seemed not to hear her . 
He was looking around at the wrecked office . 
" You'd better get those two off to bed , " said Fudge , looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod towards Harry and Marietta . 
Professor McGonagall said nothing , but marched Harry and Marietta to the door . 
BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 
Dolores Jane Umbridge ( High Inquisitor ) has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty - eight . 
Signed : Cornelius Oswald Fudge , Minister for Magic 
The notices had gone up all around the school overnight , but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors , the High Inquisitor , the Minister for Magic and his Junior Assistant to escape . 
No matter where Harry went within the castle , the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore's flight , and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling ( Harry overheard one second - year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St . Mungo's with a pumpkin for a head ) it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was . 
Everybody knew , for instance , that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore's office and , as Marietta was now in the hospital wing , Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a first - hand account . 
" Dumbledore will be back before long , " said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology , after listening intently to Harry's story . 
The Fat Friar told me - " he dropped his voice conspiratorially , so that Harry , Ron and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear " - that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they'd searched the castle and grounds for him . 
" Oh , I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Heads office , " said Hermione viciously , as they walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall . 
" Now , do you really want to finish that sentence , Granger ? " 
Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door , closely followed by Crabbe and Goyle . 
His pale , pointed face was alight with malice . 
" Afraid I'm going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff , " he drawled . 
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered . 
" But members of the Inquisitorial Squad - " 
" The what ! " said Hermione sharply . 
" A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic , hand - picked by Professor Umbridge . 
Anyway , members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points … so , Granger , I ' ll have five from you for being rude about our new Headmistress . 
Macmillan , five for contradicting me . 
Five because I don't like you , Potter . 
Weasley , your shirts untucked , so I ' ll have another five for that . 
Oh yeah , I forgot , you ' re a Mudblood , Granger , so ten off for that . " 
Ron pulled out his wand , but Hermione pushed it away , whispering , " Don't ! " 
" New Head , new times … be good now , Potty … Weasel King … " 
Laughing heartily , he strode away with Crabbe and Goyle . 
But Harry , Ron and Hermione had turned automatically towards the giant hour - glasses set in niches along the wall behind them , which recorded the house - points . 
Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning . 
Even as they watched , stones flew upwards , reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs . 
In fact , the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald - filled one of Slytherin . 
" Noticed , have you ? " said Fred's voice . 
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ernie in front of the hour - glasses . 
" Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points , " said Harry furiously , as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour - glass . 
" Yeah , Montague tried to do us during break , " said George . 
" What do you mean , ' tried ' ? " said Ron quickly . 
" He never managed to get all the words out , " said Fred , " due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor . " 
Hermione looked very shocked . 
" But you ' ll get into terrible trouble ! " 
" Have you ever ? " asked Hermione . 
" Course we have , " said George . 
" We ' ve always known where to draw the line , " said Fred . 
" We might have put a toe across it occasionally , " said George . 
" But we ' ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem , " said Fred . 
" But now ? " said Ron tentatively . 
" Well , now - " said George . 
" - what with Dumbledore gone - " said Fred . 
" — is exactly what our dear new Head deserves , " said Fred . 
" You really mustn't ! 
We'd walk out right now if we weren't determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first . 
So , anyway , " he checked his watch , " phase one is about to begin . 
I'd get in the Great Hall for lunch , if I were you , that way the teachers will see you can't have had anything to do with it . " 
" Anything to do with what ? " said Hermione anxiously . 
" You ' ll see , " said George . 
Fred and George turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch . 
" I think we should get out of here , you know , " said Hermione nervously . 
" Yeah , all right , " said Ron , and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall , but Harry had barely glimpsed the day's ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and , turning , he found himself almost nose - to - nose with Filch the caretaker . 
" I didn't do it , " said Harry stupidly , thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning . 
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione , who were both looking worried . 
He shrugged , and followed Filch back into the Entrance Hall , against the tide of hungry students . 
As they reached the first landing he said , " Things are changing around here , Potter . " 
" I ' ve noticed , " said Harry coldly . 
" Yerse … I ' ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he's too soft with you all , " said Filch , chuckling nastily . 
Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could ' ve strung you up by the ankles in my office , would they ? 
But when Educational Decree Number Twenty - nine comes in , Potter , I ' ll be allowed to do them things … and she's asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves … oh , things are going to be very different around here with her in charge . " 
Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side , Harry thought , and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon ; his knowledge of the school's secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the Weasley twins . 
" Here we are , " he said , leering down at Harry as he rapped three times on Professor Umbridge's door and pushed it open . 
" The Potter boy to see you , Ma ' am . " 
Umbridge's office , so very familiar to Harry from his many detentions , was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word : HEADMISTRESS . 
Also , his Firebolt and Fred and George's Cleansweeps , which he saw with a pang , were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk . 
Umbridge was sitting behind the desk , busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment , but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance . 
" Thank you , Argus , " she said sweetly . 
" Sit , " said Umbridge curtly , pointing towards a chair . 
Harry sat . 
He watched some of the foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head , wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him . 
" Well , now , " she said finally , setting down her quill and surveying him complacently , like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly . 
" What would you like to drink ? " 
" What ? " said Harry , quite sure he had misheard her . 
" To drink , Mr . Potter , " she said , smiling still more widely . 
" Tea ? 
Coffee ? 
Pumpkin juice ? " 
As she named each drink , she gave her short wand a wave , and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk . 
" Nothing , thank you , " said Harry . 
" I wish you to have a drink with me , " she said , her voice becoming dangerously sweet . 
" Fine … tea then , " said Harry , shrugging . 
She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him . 
" There , " she said , handing it to him . 
" Drink it before it gets cold , won't you ? 
Well , now , Mr . Potter … I thought we ought to have a little chat , after the distressing events of last night . " 
He said nothing . 
She settled herself back into her seat and waited . 
He raised the cup to his lips and then , just as suddenly , lowered it . 
One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad - Eye Moody's magical one and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad - Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy . 
" What's the matter ? " said Umbridge , who was still watching him closely . 
" Do you want sugar ? " 
" No , " said Harry . 
He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip , though keeping his mouth tightly closed . 
Umbridge's smile widened . 
" Good , " she whispered . 
" Very good . 
Now then … " She leaned forwards a little . 
" Where is Albus 
Dumbledore ? " 
" No idea , " said Harry promptly . 
" Drink up , drink up , " she said , still smiling . 
" Now , Mr . Potter , let us not play childish games . 
I know that you know where he has gone . 
You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning . 
Consider your position , Mr . Potter … " 
" I don't know where he is , " Harry repeated . 
She was watching him very closely . 
" Very well , " she said , though she looked displeased . 
" In that case , you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black . " 
He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together , so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes . 
" I don't know , " he said , a little too quickly . 
Potter , " said Umbridge , " let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October . 
I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today , I promise you . 
I repeat , Mr . Potter … where is Sirius Black ? " 
" No idea , " said Harry loudly . 
They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering . 
Then Umbridge stood up . 
" Very well , Potter , I will take your word for it this time , but be warned : the might of the Ministry stands behind me . 
All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored . 
And Mr . Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle . 
If I find a shred of evidence … " 
BOOM ! 
The very floor of the office shook . 
" What was - ? " 
She was gazing towards the door . 
Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost - full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers . 
He could hear people running and screaming several floors below . 
" Back to lunch you go , Potter ! " cried Umbridge , raising her wand and dashing out of the office . 
Harry gave her a few seconds'start , then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was . 
It was not difficult to find . 
Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors , emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went ; shocking - pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers ; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls ; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord ; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked , and instead of burning themselves out , fading from sight or fizzling to a halt , these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched . 
Filch and Umbridge were standing , apparently transfixed in horror , halfway down the stairs . 
As Harry watched , one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver ; it whirled towards Umbridge and Filch with a sinister ' wheeeeeeeeee ' . 
They both yelled with fright and ducked , and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds . 
Meanwhile , several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor . 
" Hurry , Filch , hurry ! " shrieked Umbridge , " they ' ll be all over the school unless we do something - Stupefy " 
A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets . 
Instead of freezing in midair , it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy - looking witch in the middle of a meadow ; she ran for it just in time , reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting , where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her . 
He dashed to a nearby cupboard , pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair ; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze . 
Harry had seen enough ; laughing , he ducked down low , ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it , listening to Umbridge and Filch's yells and quaking with suppressed mirth . 
" Impressive , " Harry said quietly , grinning . 
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon . 
Though they caused plenty of disruption , particularly the firecrackers , the other teachers didn't seem to mind them very much . 
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as Headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers , none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her . 
When the final bell rang and they were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags , Harry saw , with immense satisfaction , a disheveled and soot - blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty - faced from Professor Flitwick's classroom . 
" Thank you so much , Professor ! " said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice . 
" I could have got rid of the sparklers myself , of course , but I wasn't sure whether or not I had the authority . " 
Beaming , he closed his classroom door in her snarling face . 
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room . 
Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them . 
Only thing is , we used our whole stock ; we ' re going to have to start again from scratch now . " 
" If you want to add your name to the waiting list , Hermione , it's five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe … " 
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself . 
" Oh , why don't we have a night off ? " said Hermione brightly , as a silver - tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window . 
" Are you feeling all right ? " 
Ron asked , staring at her in disbelief . 
" Now you mention it , " said Hermione happily , " d ' you know … I think I'm feeling a bit … rebellious . " 
Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour later ; and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower , still resolutely spelling out the word TOO . 
With his glasses off , the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred , looking like sparkling clouds , beautiful and mysterious against the black sky . 
He turned on to his side , wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledore's job , and how Fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption . 
Smiling to himself , Harry closed his eyes … 
He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries . 
He was speeding towards the plain black door … let it open … let it open … 
It did . 
He was inside the circular room lined with doors … he crossed it , placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards … 
Now he was in a long , rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking . 
There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate … he had to go on … 
There was a door at the far end … it , too , opened at his touch … 
And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church , full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves , each laden with small , dusty , spun - glass spheres … now Harrys heart was beating fast with excitement … he knew where to go … he ran forwards , but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous , deserted room … 
There was something in this room he wanted very , very much … 
His scar was hurting … 
BANG ! 
Harry awoke instantly , confused and angry . 
The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter . 
Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look . 
Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower . 
Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them . 
His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening . 
Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream . 
With a surge of guilt he realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson : there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left ; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried . 
He attempted a little last - minute practice during classes that day , but it was no good . 
Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and , after all , the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class . 
Resigned to the worst , he set off for Snape's office after dinner . 
" Over here , " said Harry , glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape , and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour - glasses stood . 
Gryffindor's was now almost empty . 
" Are you okay ? 
" Oh , no , " said Cho hurriedly . 
" No , it was only … well , I just wanted to say … Harry , I never dreamed Marietta would tell … " 
" Yeah , well , " said Harry moodily . 
He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully ; it was small consolation that the last he had heard , Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples . 
" She's a lovely person really , " said Cho . " She just made a mistake - " 
Harry looked at her incredulously . 
" A lovely person who made a mistake ? 
She sold us all out , including you ! " 
" You know , her mum works for the Ministry , it's really difficult for her - " 
Harry said furiously . 
" That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's , " said Cho fiercely . 
" I think it was a brilliant idea , " said Harry coldly . 
Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter . 
" Oh yes , I forgot - of course , if it was darling Hermione's idea - " 
Fuming , Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon and , though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful , he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door . 
" You ' re late , Potter , " said Snape coldly , as Harry closed the door behind him . 
Snape was standing with his back to Harry , removing , as usual , certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledores Pensieve . 
He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry . 
" So , " he said . 
" Have you been practicing ? " 
" Yes , " Harry lied , looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape's desk . 
" Well , we ' ll soon find out , won't we ? " said Snape smoothly . 
" Wand out , Potter . " 
Harry moved into his usual position , facing Snape with the desk between them . 
His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind . 
" One - two - " 
Snape's office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in . 
" Professor Snape , sir - oh - sorry - " 
Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise . 
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid . 
" I didn't know , " he said , leering at Harry , who knew his face was burning . 
He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy - or , even better , to hit him with a good curse . 
" Well , Draco , what is it ? " 
asked Snape . 
" It's Professor Umbridge , sir - she needs your help , " said Malfoy . 
" They ' ve found Montague , sir , he's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor . " 
" How did he get in there ? " demanded Snape . 
Potter , " said Snape , " we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening . " 
He turned and swept from his office . 
Malfoy mouthed , " Remedial Potions ? " at Harry behind Snape's back before following him . 
Seething , Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room . 
At least he had twenty - four more hours in which to practice ; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape , though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial Potions . 
He was at the office door when he saw it : a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe . 
He stopped , and stood looking at it , reminded of something … then he remembered : it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night , the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries . 
He turned around . 
The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk . 
Snape's thoughts … things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's Defenses accidentally … 
Harry gazed at the Pensieve , curiosity welling inside him … what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry ? 
The silvery lights shivered on the wall … Harry took two steps towards the desk , thinking hard . 
Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him ? 
Harry looked over his shoulder , his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever . 
How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet ? 
Would he come straight back to his office afterwards , or accompany Montague to the hospital wing ? 
Surely the latter … Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team , Snape would want to make sure he was all right . 
Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it , gazing into its depths . 
The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent . 
He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand . 
Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent . 
He was , once again , looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling … in fact , unless he was much mistaken , he was looking down into the Great Hall . 
His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts … his brain seemed to be in limbo … it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do … he was trembling … Snape could be back at any moment … but Harry thought of Cho's anger , of Malfoy's jeering face , and a reckless daring seized him . 
He took a great gulp of breath , and plunged his face into the surface of Snape's thoughts . 
At once , the floor of the office lurched , tipping Harry head - first into the Pensieve … 
He was falling through cold blackness , spinning furiously as he went , and then - 
He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall , but the four house tables were gone . 
Instead , there were more than a hundred smaller tables , all facing the same way , at each of which sat a student , head bent low , scribbling on a roll of parchment . 
The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment . 
Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads , which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light . 
Harry looked around carefully . 
Snape had to be here somewhere … this was his memory … 
And there he was , at a table right behind Harry . 
Harry stared . 
Snape - the - teenager had a stringy , pallid look about him , like a plant kept in the dark . 
His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table , his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled . 
Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper : DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS - ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL . 
His hand was flying across the parchment ; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbors , and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped . 
" Five more minutes ! " 
The voice made Harry jump . 
Turning , he saw the top of Professor Flitwick's head moving between the desks a short distance away . 
Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair … very untidy black hair … 
The back of the black - haired boy's head drew nearer and … he was straightening up now , putting down his quill , pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written … 
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen - year - old father . 
Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach : it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes . 
James's eyes were hazel , his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead , but they had the same thin face , same mouth , same eyebrows ; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did , his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that , when James stood up , they would be within an inch of each other in height . 
Then , with a glance towards Professor Flitwick , he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him . 
Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease , tilting it back on two legs . 
He was very good - looking ; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved , and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully , though he didn't seem to have noticed . 
And two seats along from this girl - Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm - was Remus Lupin . 
He looked rather pale and peaky ( was the full moon approaching ? ) and was absorbed in the exam : as he reread his answers , he scratched his chin with the end of his quill , frowning slightly . 
Wormtail looked anxious ; he was chewing his fingernails , staring down at his paper , scuffing the ground with his toes . 
Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment , then back at James , who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment . 
He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L . E . 
" Quills down , please ! " squeaked Professor Flitwick . 
Accio ! " 
Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick's outstretched arms , knocking him backwards off his feet . 
A couple of students at the front desks got up , took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet . 
" Thank you … thank you , " panted Professor Flitwick . 
Harry looked down at his father , who had hastily crossed out the L . E . he had been embellishing , jumped to his feet , stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag , which he slung over his back , and stood waiting for Sirius to join him . 
Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away , moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall , still absorbed in his own exam paper . 
Round - shouldered yet angular , he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider , and his oily hair was jumping about his face . 
A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James , Sirius and Lupin , and by planting himself in their midst , Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends . 
" Did you like question ten , Moony ? " asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall . 
" Give five signs that identify the werewolf . 
" D ' you think you managed to get all the signs ? " said James in tones of mock concern . 
" Think I did , " said Lupin seriously , as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds . 
" I got the snout shape , the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail , ' he said anxiously , " but I couldn't think what else - " 
" How thick are you , Wormtail ? " said James impatiently . 
" You run round with a werewolf once a month - " 
Harry looked anxiously behind him again . 
Snape remained close by , still buried in his exam questions - but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds , he , Harry , would not be able to follow James any further . 
To his intense relief , however , when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake , Snape followed , still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going . 
By keeping a little ahead of him , Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others . 
" Well , I thought that paper was a piece of cake , " he heard Sirius say . 
" I ' ll be surprised if I don't get ' Outstanding ' on it at least . " 
" Me too , " said James . 
He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch . 
He started playing with the Snitch , allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again ; his reflexes were excellent . 
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry , Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework , and threw themselves down on the grass . 
Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw , to his delight , that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes . 
He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever , which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree . 
The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake , on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting , with their shoes and socks off , cooling their feet in the water . 
Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass , looking rather haughty and bored , but very handsomely so . 
James was still playing with the Snitch , letting it zoom further and further away , almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second . 
Every time James made a particularly difficult catch , Wormtail gasped and applauded . 
Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy , and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water's edge . 
" If it bothers you , " he said , stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket . 
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off . 
" I'm bored , " said Sirius . 
" We ' ve still got Transfiguration , if you ' re bored you could test me . 
But Sirius snorted . 
" I don't need to look at that rubbish , I know it all . " 
" This ' ll liven you up , Padfoot , " said James quietly . 
" Look who it is … " 
Sirius's head turned . 
He became very still , like a dog that has scented a rabbit . 
" Excellent , " he said softly . 
Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at . 
Snape was on his feet again , and was stowing the OWL paper in his bag . 
As he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass , Sirius and James stood up . 
Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting : Lupin was still staring down at his book , though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows ; Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face . 
" All right , Snivellus ? " said James loudly . 
Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack : dropping his bag , he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted , " Expelliarmus ! " 
Snape's wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him . 
" Impedimenta ! " he said , pointing his wand at Snape , who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand . 
Students all around had turned to watch . 
Snape lay panting on the ground . 
James and Sirius advanced on him , wands raised , James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water's edge as he went . 
" How'd the exam go , Snivelly ? " said James . 
" I was watching him , his nose was touching the parchment , " said Sirius viciously . 
" There ' ll be great grease marks all over it , they won't be able to read a word . " 
Snape was trying to get up , but the jinx was still operating on him ; he was struggling , as though bound by invisible ropes . 
" You - wait , " he panted , staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing , " you - wait ! " 
" What ' re you going to do , Snivelly , wipe your nose on us ? " 
Snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes , but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened . 
" Wash out your mouth , " said James coldly . 
" Scourgify ! " 
Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape's mouth at once ; the froth was covering his lips , making him gag , choking him - 
" Leave him ALONE ! " 
James and Sirius looked round . 
James's free hand immediately jumped to his hair . 
It was one of the girls from the lake edge . 
She had thick , dark red hair that fell to her shoulders , and startlingly green almond - shaped eyes - Harry's eyes . 
Harry's mother . 
" All right , Evans ? " said James , and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant , deeper , more mature . 
" Leave him alone , " Lily repeated . 
" What's he done to you ? " 
" Well , " said James , appearing to deliberate the point , " it's more the fact that he exists , if you know what I mean … " 
" You think you ' re funny , " she said coldly . 
Leave him alone . " 
" I will if you go out with me , Evans , " said James quickly . 
" Go on … go out with me and I ' ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again . " 
" I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid , " said Lily . 
" Bad luck , Prongs , " said Sirius briskly , and turned back to Snape . 
But too late ; Snape had directed his wand straight at James ; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face , spattering his robes with blood . 
James whirled about : a second flash of light later , Snape was hanging upside - down in the air , his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny , pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants . 
Many people in the small crowd cheered ; Sirius , James and Wormtail roared with laughter . 
Lily , whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile , said , " Let him down ! " 
" Certainly , " said James and he jerked his wand upwards ; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground . 
Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet , wand up , but Sirius said , " Locomotor mortis ! " and Snape keeled over again at once , rigid as a board . 
She had her own wand out now . 
James and Sirius eyed it warily . 
" Ah , Evans , don't make me hex you , " said James earnestly . 
" Take the curse off him , then ! " 
James sighed deeply , then turned to Snape and muttered the counter - curse . 
" You ' re lucky Evans was here , Snivellus — " 
" I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her ! " 
Lily blinked . 
" Fine , " she said coolly . 
And I'd wash your pants if I were you , Snivellus . " 
" Apologize to Evans ! " James roared at Snape , his wand pointed threateningly at him . 
" I don't want you to make him apologize , " Lily shouted , rounding on James . 
" You ' re as bad as he is . " 
" What ? " yelped James . 
" I'd NEVER call you a - you - know - what ! " 
" Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you ' ve just got off your broomstick , showing off with that stupid Snitch , walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can - I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it . 
You make me SICK . " 
She turned on her heel and hurried away . 
" Hey , EVANS ! " 
But she didn't look back . 
" What is it with her ? " said James , trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him . 
" Right , " said James , who looked furious now , " right - " 
There was another flash of light , and Snape was once again hanging upside - down in the air . 
" Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants ? " 
But whether James really did take off Snapes pants , Harry never found out . 
Wincing , Harry looked round to see who had hold of him , and saw , with a thrill of horror , a fully grown , adult - sized Snape standing right beside him , white with rage . 
Harry felt himself rising into the air ; the summer's day evaporated around him ; he was floating upwards through icy blackness , Snape's hand still tight upon his upper arm . 
Then , with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head - over - heels in midair , his feet hit the stone floor of Snape's dungeon and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape's desk in the shadowy , present - day Potion masters study . 
" So , " said Snape , gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb . 
" N - no , " said Harry , trying to free his arm . 
It was scary : Snape's lips were shaking , his face was white , his teeth were bared . 
" Amusing man , your father , wasn't he ? " said Snape , shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose . 
Snape threw Harry from him with all his might . 
Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor . 
" You will not repeat what you saw to anybody ! " Snape bellowed . 
" No , of course I w — " 
" Get out , get out , I don't want to see you in this office ever again ! " 
And as Harry hurtled towards the door , a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head . 
He wrenched the door open and flew along the corridor , stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and Snape . 
There he leaned against the wall , panting , and rubbing his bruised arm . 
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early , nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen . 
What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him ; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers , knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him , and that judging from what he had just seen , his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him . 
" I ' ve told you , " Harry muttered . 
" Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I ' ve got the basics . " 
" Pretty much , " said Harry , not looking at her . 
" Well , I don't think Snape should stop until you ' re absolutely sure you can control them ! " said Hermione indignantly . 
" Harry , I think you should go back to him and ask - " 
" No , " said Harry forcefully . 
It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione , as was her custom , had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedule for the three of them . 
Harry and Ron had let her do it ; it was easier than arguing with her and , in any case , they might come in useful . 
" Well , there you are , " she said , handing him his timetable , " if you follow that you should do fine . " 
Ron looked down it gloomily , but then brightened . 
" That's for Quidditch practice , " said Hermione . 
The smile faded from Ron's face . 
" What's the point ? " he said dully . 
" We ' ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic . " 
Hermione said nothing ; she was looking at Harry , who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand , trying to get his ears scratched . 
" What's wrong , Harry ? " 
" What ? " he said quickly . 
" Nothing . " 
" I saw Cho earlier , " said Hermione tentatively . 
" Wha — oh , yeah , we have , " said Harry , seizing gratefully on the excuse . 
" What about ? " 
" That sneak friend of hers , Marietta , " said Harry . 
Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe , which Harry found helpful ; all he had to do was look angry , nod and say " Yeah " and " That's right " whenever Ron drew breath , leaving his mind free to dwell , ever more miserably , on what he had seen in the Pensieve . 
He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside . 
He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character . 
( Yeah , well , look what Sirius was like himself , said a nagging voice inside Harry's head … he was as bad , wasn't he ? ) Yes , he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school , but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins , and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside - down for the fun of it … not unless they really loathed them … perhaps Malfoy , or somebody who really deserved it … 
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands : but hadn't Lily asked , " What's he done to you ? " 
Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius … but in the Pensieve , he had sat there and let it all happen … 
Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it … 
For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort , of inspiration . 
And now … now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him . 
The weather grew breezier , brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed , but Harry , along with the rest of the fifth - and seventh - years , was trapped inside , traipsing back and forth to the library . 
Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams , and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves , his excuse went unchallenged . 
" Harry , I'm talking to you , can you hear me ? " 
" Huh ? " 
He looked round . 
It was late on Sunday evening : Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes , and Ron had Quidditch practice . 
" Oh , hi , " said Harry , pulling his books towards him . 
" It's over , " said Ginny . 
" Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing . " 
" Why ? " 
" Anyway … a package just arrived , it's only just got through Umbridge's new screening process . " 
She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table ; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re - wrapped . 
There was a scribbled note across it in red ink , reading : Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor . 
" It's Easter eggs from Mum , " said Ginny . 
" There's one for you … there you go . " 
She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small , iced Snitches and , according to the packaging , containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees . 
Harry looked at it for a moment , then , to his horror , felt a lump rise in his throat . 
" Are you okay , Harry ? " Ginny asked quietly . 
" Yeah , I'm fine , " said Harry gruffly . 
" You know , I'm sure if you just talked to Cho … " 
" It's not Cho I want to talk to , " said Harry brusquely . 
" I … " 
He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening . 
Madam Pince was several shelves away , stamping out a pile of books for a frantic - looking Hannah Abbott . 
" I wish I could talk to Sirius , " he muttered . 
" But I know I can't . " 
" Well , " said Ginny slowly , helping herself to a bit of egg , too , " if you really want to talk to Sirius , I expect we could think of a way to do it . " 
" Come on , " said Harry dully . 
" The thing about growing up with Fred and George , " said Ginny thoughtfully , " is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you ' ve got enough nerve . " 
Harry looked at her . 
Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate - Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with Dementors - or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week , but he felt a bit more hopeful . 
" WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING ? " 
" Chocolate in the library ! " she screamed . 
" Out - out - OUT ! " And whipping out her wand , she caused Harry's books , bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library , whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran . 
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations , a batch of pamphlets , leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays , along with yet another notice on the board , which read : 
All fifth - years are required to attend a short meeting with their Head of House during the first week of the summer term to discuss their future careers . 
Times of individual appointments are listed below . 
Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half past two on Monday , which would mean missing most of Divination . 
He and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal . 
" Well , I don't fancy Healing , " said Ron on the last evening of the holidays . 
He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone - and - wand emblem of St . Mungo's on its front . 
" Well , it's a very responsible job , isn't it ? " said Hermione absently . 
" You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles ; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies : ' Much more important is your enthusiasm , patience and a good sense of fun ! ' " 
" Listen to this : Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel , adventure and substantial , danger - related treasure bonuses ? 
Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank , who are currently recruiting Curse - Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad … They want Arithmancy , though ; you could do it , Hermione ! " 
" Hey , " said a voice in Harry's ear . 
" Ginnys had a word with us about you , " said Fred , stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor . 
" She says you need to talk to Sirius ? " 
" Yeah … " said Harry , trying to sound casual , " yeah , I thought I'd like - " 
" Don't be so ridiculous , " said Hermione , straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes . 
" With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls ? " 
" Well , we think we can find a way around that , " said George , stretching and smiling . 
" It's a simple matter of causing a diversion . 
And of course , we'd have messed up people's studying , too , which would be the very last thing we'd want to do . " 
He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod . 
" And if we ' re going to be causing a bit of uproar , why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius ? " 
" Umbridge's office , " said Harry quietly . 
Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own . 
" Are - you - insane ? " said Hermione in a hushed voice . 
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily . 
" I don't think so , " said Harry , shrugging . 
" And how are you going to get in there in the first place ? " 
" Sirius's knife , " he said . 
" So even if she's bewitched the door so Alohomora won't work , which I bet she has - " 
" What do you think about this ? " Hermione demanded of Ron , and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs . Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place . 
" If Harry wants to do it , it's up to him , isn't it ? " 
" Spoken like a true friend and Weasley , " said Fred , clapping Ron hard on the back . 
" Right , then . 
We're thinking of doing it tomorrow , just after lessons , because it should cause maximum impact if everybody's in the corridors - Harry , we ' ll set it off in the east wing somewhere , draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we should be able to guarantee you , what , twenty minutes ? " he said , looking at George . 
" Easy , " said George . 
" What sort of diversion is it ? " 
asked Ron . 
Harry awoke very early the next day , feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic . 
It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous , though that was certainly bad enough ; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office . 
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead , Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed , and stared out on a truly glorious morning . 
The sky was a clear , misty , opalescent blue . 
Directly ahead of him , Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape . 
He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve , but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened , to know of any mitigating factors there might have been , any excuse at all for his father's behavior … 
Something caught Harry's attention : movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees . 
He seemed to be limping . 
As Harry watched , Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it . 
Hagrid did not emerge again , but smoke furled from the chimney , so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire . 
Harry turned away from the window , headed back to his trunk and started to dress . 
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead , Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one , but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o ' clock . 
For the first time ever , she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were , keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore . 
" … and if she does catch you there , apart from being expelled , she ' ll be able to guess you ' ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she ' ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions … " 
" Hermione , " said Ron in a low and indignant voice , " are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns , or am I going to have to take my own notes ? " 
By the time they reached the dungeons , neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione . 
Snape , meanwhile , seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible . 
Harry was , of course , well - used to this tactic , as it was one of Uncle Vernon's favorites , and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse . 
In fact , compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks , he found the new approach something of an improvement , and was pleased to find that when left well alone , he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily . 
At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask , corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking , feeling that he might at last have scraped an E . 
He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise . 
Harry whipped around . 
His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure . 
" Whoops , " he said softly . 
He strode back to his cauldron , intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it , but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished . 
" I'm sorry ! " said Hermione , with her hands over her mouth . 
" I'm really sorry , Harry . 
I thought you'd finished , so I cleared up ! " 
Harry could not bring himself to answer . 
When the bell rang , he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance , and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office . 
He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath , only a few minutes late . 
" Sorry , Professor , " he panted , as he closed the door . 
" I forgot . " 
" No matter , Potter , " she said briskly , but as she spoke , somebody else sniffed from the corner . 
Harry looked round . 
Professor Umbridge was sitting there , a clipboard on her knee , a fussy little pie - frill around her neck and a small , horribly smug smile on her face . 
" Sit down , Potter , " said Professor McGonagall tersely . 
Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk . 
Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard . 
" Well , Potter , this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have , and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts ? " 
" Er - " said Harry . 
" Yes ? " Professor McGonagall prompted Harry . 
" You'd need top grades for that , " said Professor McGonagall , extracting a small , dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it . 
Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office . 
In fact , I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years . " 
At this moment , Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough , as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it . 
Professor McGonagall ignored her . 
" You ' ll want to know which subjects you ought to take , I suppose ? " she went on , talking a little louder than before . 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" Naturally , " said Professor McGonagall crisply . 
" I would also advise - " 
Professor Umbridge gave another cough , a little more audible this time . 
Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment , opened them again , and continued as though nothing had happened . 
I'd say you ' re averaging ' Acceptable ' at the moment , so you ' ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing . 
Yes , Potter , Potions , " she added , with the merest flicker of a smile . 
" May I offer you a cough drop , Dolores ? " Professor McGonagall asked curtly , without looking at Professor Umbridge . 
" Oh , no , thank you very much , " said Umbridge , with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much . 
" I daresay you ' ll find you can , " said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth . 
" I was just wondering whether Mr . Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror ? " said Professor Umbridge sweetly . 
" Were you ? " said Professor McGonagall haughtily . 
I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ' Acceptable ' and ' Exceeds Expectations ' for the last two years , so your Charmwork seems satisfactory . 
" I was just concerned that you might not have Harrys most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you . 
I'm quite sure I slipped in a note . " 
" What , this thing ? " said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion , as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder . 
She glanced down it , her eyebrows slightly raised , then placed it back into the folder without comment . 
" Of course I understood it , " said Professor McGonagall , her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled . 
" Well , then , I am confused … I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr . Potter false hope that - " 
" False hope ? " repeated Professor McGonagall , still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge . 
" I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you , Minerva , but as you will see from my note , Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - " 
" I should have made my meaning plainer , " said Professor McGonagall , turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes . 
Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing . 
She sat back in her chair , turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed , her bulging eyes rolling from side to side . 
Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry , her thin nostrils flared , her eyes burning . 
" Any questions , Potter ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry . 
" What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you , if you get enough NEWTs ? " 
" Well , you ' ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth , " said Professor McGonagall , " perseverance and dedication , because Auror training takes a further three years , not to mention very high skills in practical Defense . 
It will mean a lot more study even after you ' ve left school , so unless you ' re prepared to - " 
" I think you ' ll also find , " said Umbridge , her voice very cold now , " that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors . 
" - unless you ' re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts , you should really look at another - " 
" Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school . " 
" A very good chance , then , " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Potter has a criminal record , " said Umbridge loudly . 
Professor Umbridge stood up . 
She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference , but her fussy , simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad , flabby face look oddly sinister . 
Professor McGonagall got to her feet , too , and in her case this was a much more impressive move ; she towered over Professor Umbridge . 
" Potter , " she said in ringing tones , " I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do ! 
If I have to coach you nightly , I will make sure you achieve the required results ! " 
" The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter ! " said Umbridge , her voice rising furiously . 
" Yes ! 
Yes , yes , yes ! 
Of course ! 
That's what you want , isn't it , Minerva McGonagall ? 
You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore ! 
You think you ' ll be where I am , don't you : Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot ! " 
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room , not daring to look at Professor Umbridge . 
He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor . 
Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon . 
" I hope you ' ve thought better of what you were planning to do , Harry , " Hermione whispered , the moment they had opened their books to ' Chapter Thirty - four , Non - Retaliation and Negotiation ' . 
Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry , who kept his head down , staring at Defensive Magical Theory , his eyes unfocused , thinking … 
He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him … there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve … nothing , except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach … and then there was the matter of Fred and George , whose diversion was already planned , not to mention the knife Sirius had given him , which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak . 
But the fact remained that if he was caught … 
He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago … 
And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room … 
But did he want to be like his father any more ? 
Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class . 
He did not answer ; he did not know what to do . 
Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice ; he would not look at Harry , though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more , he said in a low voice , " Give it a rest , okay ? 
He can make up his own mind . " 
Harrys heart beat very fast as he left the classroom . 
He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance . 
There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them ; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - 
Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her . 
Pulling out her wand , she hurried off in the opposite direction : it was now or never . 
" Harry - please ! " Hermione pleaded weakly . 
But he had made up his mind ; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder , he set off at a run , weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing . 
Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted . 
Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him , he pulled open his bag , seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak . 
He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door . 
He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down , then withdrew it . 
There was a tiny click , and the door swung open . 
He ducked inside the office , closed the door quickly behind him and looked around . 
Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks . 
Harry pulled off his Cloak and , striding over to the fireplace , found what he was looking for within seconds : a small box containing glittering Floo powder . 
He crouched down in front of the empty grate , his hands shaking . 
He had never done this before , though he thought he knew how it must work . 
Sticking his head into the fireplace , he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him . 
Harry said loudly and clearly . 
It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced . 
He had traveled by Floo powder before , of course , but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country . 
This time , his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge's office , and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire … 
And then , as abruptly as it had begun , the spinning stopped . 
Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head , Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long , wooden table , where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment . 
" Sirius ? " 
The man jumped and looked around . 
It was not Sirius , but Lupin . 
" Harry ! " he said , looking thoroughly shocked . 
" What are you - what's happened , is everything all right ? " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" I just wondered — I mean , I just fancied a - a chat with Sirius . " 
" I ' ll call him , " said Lupin , getting to his feet , still looking perplexed , " he went upstairs to look for Kreacher , he seems to be hiding in the attic again … " 
And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen . 
Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs . 
Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later . 
" What is it ? " said Sirius urgently , sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire , so that he and Harry were on a level . 
" Are you all right ? 
Do you need help ? " 
" No , " said Harry , " it's nothing like that … I just wanted to talk … about my dad . " 
They exchanged a look of great surprise , but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed ; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion ; George had only guaranteed him twenty . 
He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve . 
When he had finished , neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment . 
Then Lupin said quietly , " I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there , Harry . 
" I'm fifteen ! " said Harry heatedly . 
" Look , Harry " said Sirius placatingly , " James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other , it was just one of those things , you can understand that , can't you ? 
And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts , and James - whatever else he may have appeared to you , Harry - always hated the Dark Arts . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry , " but he just attacked Snape for no good reason , just because - well , just because you said you were bored , " he finished , with a slightly apologetic note in his voice . 
" I'm not proud of it , " said Sirius quickly . 
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius , then said , " Look , Harry , what you ' ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - " 
" If we were sometimes arrogant little berks , you mean , " said Sirius . 
Lupin smiled . 
" He kept messing up his hair , " said Harry in a pained voice . 
Sirius and Lupin laughed . 
" I'd forgotten he used to do that , " said Sirius affectionately . 
" Well … I thought he was a bit of an idiot . " 
" Of course he was a bit of an idiot ! " said Sirius bracingly , " we were all idiots ! 
Well - not Moony so much , " he said fairly , looking at Lupin . 
" Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape ? " he said . 
" Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order ? " 
" Yeah , well , " said Sirius , " you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes … that was something … " 
" And , " said Harry doggedly , determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here , " he kept looking over at the girls by the lake , hoping they were watching him ! " 
Harry asked miserably . 
" She started going out with him in seventh year , " said Lupin . 
" Once James had deflated his head a bit , " said Sirius . 
" And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it , " said Lupin . 
" Even Snape ? " said Harry . 
" Well , " said Lupin slowly , " Snape was a special case I mean , he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down , could you ? " 
Sirius frowned at Harry , who was still looking unconvinced . 
" Look , " he said , " your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person . 
A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen . 
He grew out of it . " 
" Yeah , okay , " said Harry heavily . 
" I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape . " 
" Are you serious , Harry ? " said Lupin quickly . 
" But it's okay , I don't care , it's a bit of a relief to tell you the - " 
" If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me ! " he said firmly . 
" But Harry , first of all , you ' re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears - " 
" Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency ! " said Lupin sternly . 
" Do you understand me ? 
Nothing ! " 
" I ' ll … I ' ll try and say something to him … but it won't be - " 
He fell silent . 
He could hear distant footsteps . 
" No , " said Sirius , glancing behind him . 
" It must be somebody your end . " 
" I'd better go ! " he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire . 
For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders , then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die . 
" Quickly , quickly ! " he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door . 
" Ah , she's left it open - " 
Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office . 
He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room , pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it . 
He pulled out a piece of parchment , kissed it , then shuffled rapidly back out of the door , clutching it to his chest . 
Harry leapt to his feet and , making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him , he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch , who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go . 
One landing down from Umbridge's office , Harry thought it was safe to become visible again . 
He pulled off the Cloak , shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards . 
There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall . 
He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there . 
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked . 
Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring ( some of them , Harry noticed , covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap ) ; teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd . 
Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad , who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves , and Peeves , who was bobbing overhead , gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered . 
" So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp , do you ? " 
" Pretty amusing , yeah , " said Fred , looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear . 
" I ' ve got the form , Headmistress , " he said hoarsely , waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk . 
" I ' ve got the form and I ' ve got the whips waiting … oh , let me do it now … " 
" Very good , Argus , " she said . 
" You two , " she went on , gazing down at Fred and George , " are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school . " 
" You know what ? " said Fred . " I don't think we are . " 
He turned to his twin . 
" George , " said Fred , " I think we ' ve outgrown full - time education . " 
" Time to test our talents in the real world , d ' you reckon ? " asked Fred . 
" Definitely , " said George . 
And before Umbridge could say a word , they raised their wands and said together : 
" Accio brooms ! " 
Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance . 
Looking to his left , he ducked just in time . 
Fred and George's broomsticks , one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall , were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners ; 
they turned left , streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins , the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor . 
Fred looked around at the assembled students , at the silent , watchful crowd . 
" If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp , as demonstrated upstairs , come to number ninetythree , Diagon Alley - Weasleys ' Wizarding Wheezes , " he said in a loud voice . 
" Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they ' re going to use our products to get rid of this old bat , " added George , pointing at Professor Umbridge . 
" STOP THEM ! " shrieked Umbridge , but it was too late . 
As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in , Fred and George kicked off from the floor , shooting fifteen feet into the air , the iron peg swinging dangerously below . 
Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd . 
" Give her hell from us , Peeves . " 
And Peeves , who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before , swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset . 
The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend : within a week , even those who had been eye - witnesses were half - convinced they had seen the twins dive - bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors . 
In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them . 
Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon . 
For one thing , they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing . 
Eventually the area was roped off and Filch , gnashing his teeth furiously , was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms . 
Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but , just as in the case of Fred and Georges Wildfire Whiz - bangs , they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle . 
Then there were the two large broom - shaped holes in Umbridge's office door , through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters . 
Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where , it was rumored , Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it . 
However , her troubles were far from over . 
Inspired by Fred and George's example , a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers - in - Chief . 
In spite of the new door , somebody managed to slip a hairy - snouted Niffler into Umbridge's office , which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects , leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers . 
Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble - Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons , which ensured them a supply of fresh air , even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside - down goldfish bowls on their heads . 
Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands , desperate to catch miscreants , but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn . 
Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes ; Pansy Parkinson , to Hermiones delight , missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers . 
Meanwhile , it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts . 
Shrieking with rage and frustration , she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source , but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from ' Umbridge - itis ' . 
After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret , she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding , swooning , sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves . 
But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos , Peeves , who seemed to have taken Fred's parting words deeply to heart . 
Cackling madly , he soared through the school , upending tables , bursting out of blackboards , toppling statues and vases ; twice he shut Mrs . Norris inside a suit of armor , from which she was rescued , yowling loudly , by the furious caretaker . 
Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles , juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students , caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows ; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms , dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and , whenever he fancied a break , spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke . 
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her . 
Indeed , a week after Fred and George's departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves , who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier , and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth , " It unscrews the other way . " 
To cap matters , Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet ; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive , looking extremely angry . 
" Should we say something ? " said Hermione in a worried voice , pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr . and Mrs . Montague marching inside . 
In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him ? " 
" Anyway , more trouble for Umbridge , isn't it ? " said Harry in a satisfied voice . 
Harry's spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair . 
Ron's grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty , trembled for a few seconds , then folded , causing the cup to crack into two . 
" Who cares ? " said Ron irritably , while his teacup stood up drunkenly again , trembling violently at the knees . 
If you want to worry about anyone , Hermione , worry about me ! " 
" You ? " she said , catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow - patterned legs , and replacing it in front of her . 
" When Mum's next letter finally gets through Umbridge's screening process , " said Ron bitterly , now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight , " I'm going to be in deep trouble . 
" But - " 
" It ' ll be my fault Fred and George left , you wait , " said Ron darkly . 
But I'm sure she won't , I mean , if it's really true they ' ve got premises in Diagon Alley , they must have been planning this for ages . " 
" It's a bit dodgy isn't it ? 
She ' ll want to know what they ' ve been up to , to get their hands on that sort of gold . " 
" Well , yes , that occurred to me , too , " said Hermione , allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's , whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop , " I ' ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . " 
" He hasn't , " said Harry curtly . 
" How do you know ? " said Ron and Hermione together . 
" Because - " Harry hesitated , but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come . 
I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June . " 
There was a shocked silence , then Hermione's teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor . 
" Oh , Harry , you didn't ! " she said . 
" Yes , I did , " said Harry mutinously . 
" And I don't regret it , either . 
" But this is excellent ! " said Ron , looking thrilled . 
" Yeah , I suppose you'd better , " said Harry dully , " specially if she thinks they ' re receiving stolen cauldrons or something . " 
Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson , but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self - restraint was bound to crack before long . 
Sure enough , once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine , she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air . 
Harry interrupted her before she had even started . 
" It's no good nagging me , it's done , " he said firmly . 
" Fred and George have got the gold - spent a good bit of it , too , by the sounds of it - and I can't get it back from them and I don't want to . 
" I wasn't going to say anything about Fred and George ! " she said in an injured voice . 
Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look . 
" No , I wasn't ! " she said angrily . 
" As a matter of fact , I was going to ask Harry when he's going to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons ! " 
Harry's heart sank . 
Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George's dramatic departure , which admittedly had taken many hours , Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius . 
As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place , it had been hard to think of what to tell them ; he had ended up saying , truthfully , that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons . 
He had been regretting this ever since ; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it . 
" You can't tell me you ' ve stopped having funny dreams , " Hermione said now , " because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night . " 
Harry threw Ron a furious look . 
Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself . 
" I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch , " Harry lied brutally . 
" I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle . " 
Ron's ears went red . 
Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure ; he had not , of course , dreamed anything of the sort . 
Last night , he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor . 
He had passed through the circular room , then the room full of clicking and dancing light , until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres . 
He had hurried straight towards row number ninety - seven , turned left , and ran along it … it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud … just a bit further … for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake … and before he had reached the end of the row , he had found himself lying in bed again , gazing up at the canopy of his four - poster . 
" You are trying to block your mind , aren't you ? " said Hermione , looking beadily at Harry . 
The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs , that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue . 
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision , his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all ; and when he did , his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams . 
He also suspected that part of his mind - the part that often spoke in Hermione's voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door , and sought to wake him before he could reach the journeys end . 
" You know , " said Ron , whose ears were still flaming red , " if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff , we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup . " 
" Yeah , I s ' pose so , " said Harry , glad of a change of subject . 
" I mean , we ' ve won one , lost one - if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday - " 
" Yeah , that's right , " said Harry , losing track of what he was agreeing to . 
Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard , determinedly not looking at him . 
The final match of the Quidditch season , Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw , was to take place on the last weekend of May . 
Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match , Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory , due mainly ( though of course nobody said it to him ) to Ron's abysmal goal - keeping record . 
" I mean , I can't get any worse , can I ? " he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match . 
" You know , " said Hermione , as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd , " I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around . 
Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head . 
" Oh , gosh , I forgot ! " said Hermione , watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins . 
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands . 
It was a fine , clear day ; Ron could not wish for better , and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of ' Weasley is our King ' . 
As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto . 
" … Bradley … Davies … Chang , " he said , and Harry felt his stomach perform , less of a back flip , more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on to the pitch , her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze . 
He was not sure what he wanted to happen any more , except that he could not stand any more rows . 
Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy . 
" And they ' re off ! " said Lee . " And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately , Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle , he dodges Johnson , he dodges Bell , he dodges Spinnet as well … he's going straight for goal ! 
He's going to shoot - and - and - " Lee swore very loudly . 
" And he's scored . " 
Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors . 
Predictably , horribly , the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing : " Weasley cannot save a thing He cannot block a single ring … " 
" Harry " said a hoarse voice in Harrys ear . 
" Hermione … " 
Harry looked round and saw Hagrid's enormous bearded face sticking between the seats . 
For some reason , Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen , though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else . 
" Listen , " he whispered , " can yeh come with me ? 
Now ? 
While ev ' ryone's watchin'the match ? " 
" Till the match is over ? " 
" No , " said Hagrid . 
Hagrid's nose was gently dripping blood . 
Harry had not seen him this close - up since his return to the school ; he looked utterly woebegone . 
He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats , causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them . 
The people in Hagrid's row were not complaining , merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible . 
" I ' ppreciate this , you two , I really do , " said Hag rid as they reached the stairs . 
" You mean Umbridge ? " said Harry . 
She must be expecting trouble at the match . " 
" Yeah , well , a bit o ' trouble wouldn ' hurt , " said Hagrid , pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted . 
" What is it , Hagrid ? " said Hermione , looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the Forest . 
" Yeh - yeh ' ll see in a mo ' , " said Hagrid , looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them . 
" It ' ll be Ravenclaw , " said Harry heavily . 
" Good … good … " said Hagrid distractedly . 
" Tha's good … " 
When they reached his cabin , Hermione turned automatically left towards the front door . 
Hagrid , however , walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the Forest , where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree . 
When he realized they were no longer with him , he turned . 
" Into the Forest ? " said Hermione , perplexed . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid , who was already striding away from them into the green gloom , his crossbow over his arm . 
Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him . 
" Hagrid , why are you armed ? " said Harry . 
" Jus ' a precaution , " said Hagrid , shrugging his massive shoulders . 
" You didn't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals , " said Hermione timidly . 
He sighed deeply . 
" Firenze said they ' re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore , " Harry said , tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid's profile . 
" Yeah , " said Hagrid heavily . 
If I hadn'stepped in , I reckon they'd ' ve kicked Firenze ter death - " 
" They attacked him ? " said Hermione , sounding shocked . 
" He had half the herd on to him . " 
" And you stopped it ? " said Harry , amazed and impressed . 
" Lucky I was passin ' , really … an ' I'd ' ve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha ' before he started sendin ' me stupid warnin's ! " he added hotly and unexpectedly . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , startled , but Hagrid , scowling , did not elaborate . 
" Anyway , " he said , breathing a little more heavily than - usual , " since then the other centaurs ' ve bin livid with me , an'the trouble is they ' ve got a lot of influence in the Forest … cleverest creatures in here . " 
" Is that why we ' re here , Hagrid ? " asked Hermione . 
" The centaurs ? " 
" Ah , no , " said Hagrid , shaking his head dismissively , " no , it's not them . 
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk . 
They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals , but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the Forest . 
" Hagrid ! " said Harry , fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles , over which Hagrid had stepped with ease , and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the Forest path . 
" Where are we going ? " 
It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid , what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs , but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes , frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves . 
Harry's arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches . 
They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him . 
Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence . 
The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement , even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow , caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit . 
It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some kind of creature ; their absence struck him as rather ominous . 
He stopped suddenly and turned around ; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards . 
" Good ! " said Hermione , as Harry set her back on her feet . 
Hagrid's face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad . 
" Righ ' , " said Hagrid . 
" Well … see … the thing is … " 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , then back at him . 
" But you ' ve lasted this long - " Hermione said tentatively . 
" What makes you think - " 
" And was it ? " said Harry , before he could stop himself . 
I don ' wan'ter go , o ' course , but if it wasn ' fer … well … the special circumstances I'm abou ' ter explain to yeh , I'd leave righ ' now , before she's go ' the chance ter do it in front o ' the whole school , like she did with Trelawney . " 
Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest , but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands . 
" It's not the end o ' the world , I ' ll be able ter help Dumbledore once I'm outta here , I can be useful ter the Order . 
His voice trembled and broke . 
He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it . 
See , if I go … well , I can ' leave withou ' … withou ' tellin'someone … because I ' ll - I ' ll need yeh two ter help me . 
An ' Ron , if he's willin ' . " 
" Of course we ' ll help you , " said Harry at once . 
" What do you want us to do ? " 
Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force Harry was knocked sideways into a tree . 
They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes ; Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop . 
They crept forwards and Harry saw that they were facing a large , smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought , with a jolt of dread , was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal . 
Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound , so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade , behind which Harry , Hermione and Hagrid now stood . 
" Sleepin ' , " breathed Hagrid . 
Sure enough , Harry could hear a distant , rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work . 
He glanced sideways at Hermione , who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open . 
She looked utterly terrified . 
" Hagrid , " she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature , " who is he ? " 
Harry found this an odd question … " What is it ? " 
was the one he had been planning on asking . 
" Hagrid , you told us - " said Hermione , her wand now shaking in her hand , " you told us none of them wanted to come ! " 
Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then , as realization hit him , he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror . 
The great mound of earth , on which he , Hermione and Hagrid could easily have stood , was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep , grunting breathing . 
It was not a mound at all . 
It was the curved back of what was clearly — 
" Why - what - oh , Hagrid ! " 
" He's been hurting you all this time , hasn't he ? 
" So , this is why it took you two months to get home ! " said Hermione distractedly . 
" Oh , Hagrid , why did you bring him back if he didn't want to come ? 
" Small ? " said Hermione . 
" Hermione , I couldn ' leave him , " said Hagrid , tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard . 
Hermione simply stared at him , her mouth open . 
" Hagrid , when you say ' brother ' , " said Harry slowly , " d o you mean — ? " 
" Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad , an'she went an ' had Grawp here - " 
" Grawp ? " said Harry . 
" Yeah … well , tha's what it sounds like when he says his name , " said Hagrid anxiously . 
" Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back ? " asked Harry . 
" Bu ' - bu'she got a bit tired o ' him after a while , I must admit … so we split up on the journey home … she promised not ter tell anyone , though … " 
" How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing ? " said Harry . 
" Oh , Hagrid , why on earth didn't you let him ! " said Hermione , flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands . 
" What do you think you ' re going to do with a violent giant who doesn't even want to be here ! " 
" Well , now - ' violent ' - tha's a bit harsh , " said Hagrid , still twisting his hands agitatedly . 
Harry asked . 
He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them . 
" You have to keep him tied up ? " said Hermione faintly . 
Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the Forest . 
" So , what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do ? " Hermione asked apprehensively . 
" After I'm gone . " 
Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks , Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked . 
" Not food or anythin ' ! " said Hagrid eagerly . 
" He can get his own food , no problem . 
Harry said nothing , but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them . 
What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognized as Grawp's head . 
It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head , and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling , closegrowing hair the color of bracken . 
The rim of a single large , fleshy ear was visible on top of the head , which seemed to sit , rather like Uncle Vernon's , directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between . 
The back , under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together , was very broad ; and as Grawp slept , it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins . 
The legs were curled up under the body . 
Harry could see the soles of enormous , filthy , bare feet , large as sledges , resting one on top of the other on the earthy Forest floor . 
" You want us to teach him , " Harry said in a hollow voice . 
He now understood what Firenze's warning had meant . 
His attempt is not working . 
He would do better to abandon it . 
Of course , the other creatures who lived in the Forest would have heard Hagrids fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English . 
Harry looked at Hermione , who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face . 
" We ' ll … " said Harry , already bound by his promise . 
" We ' ll try , Hagrid . " 
" Wha — no ! " said Hermione , jumping up . 
But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp . 
When he was about ten feet away , he lifted a long , broken bough from the ground , smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione , then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough . 
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest ; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away . 
In front of Harry and Hermione , meanwhile , the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground , which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees . 
He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him . 
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights . 
Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted . 
They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing . 
The nose was stubby and shapeless , the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half - bricks ; the eyes , small by giant standards , were a muddy greenish - brown and just now were half - gummed together with sleep . 
Grawp raised dirty knuckles , each as big as a cricket ball , to his eyes , rubbed vigorously , then , without warning , pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility . 
" Oh my ! " Harry heard Hermione squeal , terrified , beside him . 
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously . 
He was , as Hagrid had said , at least sixteen feet tall . 
Gazing blearily around , Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella , seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside - down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it ; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself . 
" Anyway , Grawpy , " shouted Hagrid , looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs , " I ' ve brought some friends ter meet yeh . 
Remember , I told yeh I might ? 
Remember , when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an ' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit ? 
Remember that , Grawpy ? " 
But Grawp merely gave another low roar ; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech . 
He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him , evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go . 
" Now , Grawpy , don'do that ! " 
shouted Hagrid . 
" Tha's how you ended up pullin ' up the others - " 
And sure enough , Harry could see the earth around the tree's roots beginning to crack . 
" Oh , Hagrid , don't , " moaned Hermione , but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp's knee a sharp poke . 
The giant let go of the top of the tree , which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of pine needles , and looked down . 
" This , " said Hagrid , hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood , " is Harry , Grawp ! 
Harry Potter ! 
The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there . 
They watched , in great trepidation , as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them . 
" An'this is Hermione , see ? Her — " Hagrid hesitated . 
Turning to Hermione , he said , " Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy , Hermione ? 
" No , not at all , " squeaked Hermione . 
" This is Hermy , Grawp ! 
Eh ? Two friends fer yeh ter - GRAWPY , NO ! " 
Grawp's hand had shot out of nowhere towards Hermione ; Harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree , so that Grawp's fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air . 
" BAD BOY , GRAWPY ! " they heard Hagrid yelling , as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree , shaking and whimpering . 
Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back , his hand over his nose . 
" Righ ' , " said Hagrid thickly , getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow , " well … there yeh are … yeh ' ve met him an ' - an ' now he ' ll know yeh when yeh come back . 
Yeah … well … " 
He looked up at Grawp , who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face ; the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground . 
Harry and Hermione nodded . 
Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and , still pinching his nose , led the way back into the trees . 
Nobody spoke for a while , not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last . 
Hermione's face was pale and set . 
Harry could not think of a single thing to say . 
What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest ? 
And he had promised that he , Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrid's totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant . 
How could Hagrid , even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless , fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans ? 
" Hold it , " said Hagrid abruptly , just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him . 
He pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow . 
Harry and Hermione raised their wands ; now that they had stopped walking , they , too , could hear movement close by . 
" Oh , blimey " said Hagrid quietly . 
" I thought we told you , Hagrid , " said a deep male voice , " that you are no longer welcome here ? " 
This centaur had a proud , high - cheekboned face and long black hair . 
Like Hagrid , he was armed ; a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders . 
" How are yeh , Magorian ? " said Hagrid warily . 
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him . 
Harry recognized the black - bodied and bearded Bane , whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze . 
" We agreed , I think , what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the Forest again ? " 
" ' This human ' now , am I ? " said Hagrid testily . 
Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us . " 
" Firenze has entered into servitude to humans , " said a grey centaur with a hard , deeply lined face . 
" Servitude ! " said Hagrid scathingly . 
" He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans , " said Magorian quietly . 
" If yeh say so , " said Hagrid , shrugging , " but personally I think yeh ' re makin ' a big mistake - " 
" As are you , human , " said Bane , " coming back into our Forest when we warned you - " 
" I ' ll have less of the ' our ' Forest , if it's all the same ter yeh . 
" No more is it up to you , Hagrid , " said Magorian smoothly . 
" I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young — " 
" They're not his ! " interrupted Bane contemptuously . 
" Nevertheless , " said Magorian calmly , " the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime - we do not touch the innocent . 
Henceforth , stay away from this place . 
You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us . " 
" Hagrid , " said Hermione in a high - pitched and terrified voice , as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground , " let's go , please let's go ! " 
Hagrid moved forwards , but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian . 
" We know what you are keeping in the Forest , Hagrid ! " Magorian called after them , as the centaurs slipped out of sight . 
Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian . 
" Yeh ' ll tolerate ' im as long as he's here , it's as much his Forest as yours ! " he yelled , as Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid's moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards . 
Still scowling , he looked down ; his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him ; he seemed not to have felt it . 
" Hagrid , " said Hermione breathlessly , skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there , " if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest , it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able - " 
At last they rejoined the path and , after another ten minutes , the trees began to thin ; they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and , in the distance , the definite sounds of cheering and shouting . 
" Was that another goal ? " asked Hagrid , pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view . 
" Or d ' yeh reckon the match is over ? " 
" I don't know , " said Hermione miserably . 
Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear ; her hair was full of twigs and leaves , her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms . 
" Good idea , " said Harry . 
" I don't believe him , " said Hermione in a very unsteady voice , the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid . 
" I don't believe him . 
I really don't believe him . " 
" Calm down , " said Harry . 
" Calm down ! " she said feverishly . 
" A giant ! 
A giant in the Forest ! 
And we ' re supposed to give him English lessons ! 
Always assuming , of course , we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out ! 
I - don't - believe - him ! " 
Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice , as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle . 
" He's not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen . " 
" Oh , come off it , Harry ! " said Hermione angrily , stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her . 
" Of course he's going to be chucked out and , to be perfectly honest , after what we ' ve just seen , who can blame Umbridge ? " 
There was a pause in which Harry glared at her , and her eyes filled slowly with tears . 
" You didn't mean that , " said Harry quietly . 
" But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself - for us ? ' 
" I dunno - " 
" Weasley is our King , Weasley is our King , He didn't let the Quaffle in , Weasley is our King … " 
" And I wish they'd stop singing that stupid song , " said Hermione miserably , " haven't they gloated enough ? " 
A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch . 
" Oh , let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins , " said Hermione . 
" Weasley can save anything , He never leaves a single ring , That's why Gryffindors all sing , Weasley is our King . " 
" Hermione … " said Harry slowly . 
The song was growing louder , but it was issuing not from a crowd of green - and - silver - clad Slytherins , but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle , bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders . 
" Weasley is our King , Weasley is our King , He didn't let the Quaffle in , Weasley is our King … " 
" No ? " said Hermione in a hushed voice . 
" YES ! " said Harry loudly . 
" HARRY ! HERMIONE ! " yelled Ron , waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself . 
They beamed up at him as he passed . 
There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel , but nobody seemed to want to put him down . 
Still singing , the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight . 
Harry and Hermione watched them go , beaming , until the last echoing strains of ' Weasley is our King'died away . 
Then they turned to each other , their smiles fading . 
" Yes , all right , " said Hermione wearily . 
" I'm not in any hurry . " 
They climbed the steps together . 
At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination , but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance , almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots . 
All he wanted to do was talk over the match , so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp . 
Not that either of them tried very hard ; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion . 
As it was another fine , warm day , they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake , where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room . 
Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair , not to mention the occasional outbursts of ' Weasley is our King ' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good . 
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time . 
" Well , I mean , I'd already let in that one of Davies's , so I wasn't feeling all that confident , but I dunno , when Bradley came towards me , just out of nowhere , I thought - you can do this ! 
And I had about a second to decide which way to fly , you know , because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right , obviously , his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting , and so I took the chance and flew left - his right , I mean - and - well - you saw what happened , " he concluded modestly , sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them — a bunch of gossiping third - year Hufflepuffs — had heard him . 
" Why are you grinning ? " 
" I'm not , " said Harry quickly , and looked down at his Transfiguration notes , attempting to straighten his face . 
The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree . 
" I'm just glad we won , that's all . " 
" Yeah , " said Ron slowly , savoring the words , " we won . 
Did you see the look on Changs face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose ? " 
" I suppose she cried , did she ? " said Harry bitterly . 
" Er - " said Harry . 
" Well , actually … no , Ron , " said Hermione with a heavy sigh , putting down her book and looking at him apologetically . 
" As a matter of fact , the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal . " 
" You didn't watch ? " he said faintly , looking from one to the other . 
" But Ron , we didn't want to leave — we had to ! " 
" It was Hagrid , " said Harry . 
" He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants . 
He wanted us to go into the Forest with him , we had no choice , you know how he gets . 
Anyway … " 
The story was told in five minutes , by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity . 
" He brought one back and hid it in the Forest ? " 
" Yep , " said Harry grimly . 
" Well , he has , " said Hermione firmly . 
" And Hagrid wants us to … ? " 
" Teach him English , yeah , " said Harry . 
" Yes , " said Hermione irritably , turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses . 
" Yes , I'm starting to think he has . 
But , unfortunately , he made Harry and me promise . " 
" Well , you ' re just going to have to break your promise , that's all , " said Ron firmly . 
And anyway … remember Norbert ? 
" I know , it's just that - we promised , " said Hermione in a small voice . 
Ron smoothed his hair flat again , looking preoccupied . 
" Well , " he sighed , " Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet , has he ? 
The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted ; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake ; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze . 
If he had , then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry . 
This suited Harry very well ; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape , and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency ; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself , and had not laid out any elf clothes for days . 
She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer . 
Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their study habits . 
" How many hours d ' you think you ' re doing a day ? " he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology , a manic gleam in his eyes . 
" I dunno , " said Ron . " A few . " 
" More or less than eight ? " 
" Less , I s ' pose , " said Ron , looking slightly alarmed . 
" I'm doing eight , " said Ernie , puffing out his chest . 
I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day . 
I can do ten on a good weekend day . 
I did nine and a half on Monday . 
Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter . 
Then on Wednesday - " 
Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point , forcing Ernie to abandon his recital . 
Meanwhile , Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic . 
" Of course , it's not what you know , " he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start , " it's who you know . 
Now , Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda 
" Do you think that's true ? " Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron . 
" Nothing we can do about it if it is , " said Ron gloomily . 
" I don't think it's true , " said Neville quietly from behind them . 
" Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's , and she's never mentioned the Malfoys . " 
" What's she like , Neville ? " asked Hermione at once . 
" Is she strict ? " 
" Bit like Gran , really , " said Neville in a subdued voice . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione glanced at each other , but didn't know what to say . 
It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital . 
Meanwhile , a flourishing black - market trade in aids to concentration , mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth - and seventh - years . 
Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth - year Eddie Carmichael , who swore it was solely responsible for the nine ' Outstanding ' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons . 
Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job , but before they could close the deal , Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet . 
" Hermione , we wanted to buy that ! " shouted Ron . 
" Not any more , " said Hermione . 
None of these things actually work , you know . " 
" This stuff can , " said Hermione grimly . 
" I ' ve had a look at it , and it's actually dried Doxy droppings . " 
This information took the edge off Harry and Rons desire for brain stimulants . 
" As you can see , " Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard , " your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks . 
You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons . 
" Now , I must warn you that the most stringent anti - cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers . 
Our new - Headmistress — " Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt " - has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because , of course , your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - " 
" - however , that is no reason not to do your very best . 
You have your own futures to think about . " 
" Please , Professor , " said Hermione , her hand in the air , " when will we find out our results ? " 
" An owl will be sent to you some time in July " said Professor McGonagall . 
" Excellent , " said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper , " so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays . " 
Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks ' time , waiting for his OWL results . 
Well , he thought dully , at least he would be sure of one bit of post next summer . 
Their first examination , Theory of Charms , was scheduled for Monday morning . 
Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday , but regretted it almost at once ; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right , finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming . 
Meanwhile , Ron was reading two years ' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears , his lips moving soundlessly ; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor , reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 5 ; and Parvati and Lavender , who were practicing basic Locomotion Charms , were making their pencil - cases race each other around the edge of the table . 
Dinner was a subdued affair that night . 
Harry and Ron did not talk much , but ate with gusto , having studied hard all day . 
Hermione , on the other hand , kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag , from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure . 
Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night , when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate . 
" Oh , my goodness , " she said faintly , staring into the Entrance Hall . 
" Is that them ? 
Is that the examiners ? " 
Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench . 
Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient - looking witches and wizards . 
Umbridge , Harry was pleased to see , looked rather nervous . 
Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall , slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners . 
Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny , stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs ; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially . 
Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf ; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart . 
she said impatiently . 
" No idea where he is , I suppose ? " 
" None at all , " said Umbridge , shooting a malevolent look at Harry , Ron and Hermione , who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace . 
" But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough . " 
" I doubt it , " shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks , " not if Dumbledore doesn't want to be found ! 
I should know … examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs … did things with a wand I'd never seen before . " 
" Yes … well … " said Professor Umbridge as Harry , Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared , " let me show you to the staff room . 
Everyone was trying to do some last - minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far . 
Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours . 
He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did . 
He knew he was not the only one lying awake , but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally , one by one , they fell asleep . 
None of the fifth - years talked very much at breakfast next day , either : Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched ; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred ; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade . 
Once breakfast was over , the fifth - and seventh - years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons ; then , at half past nine , they were called forwards class by class to re - enter the Great Hall , which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father , Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs ; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one , all facing the staff - table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them . 
When they were all seated and quiet , she said , " You may begin , " and turned over an enormous hour - glass on the desk beside her , on which there were also spare quills , ink bottles and rolls of parchment . 
Harry turned over his paper , his heart thumping hard - three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling - and lowered his eyes to the first question : a ) Give the incantation and b ) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly . 
Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll … smiling slightly , he bent over the paper and began to write . 
" Well , it wasn't too bad , was it ? " 
asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later , still clutching the exam paper . 
" I'm not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms , I just ran out of time . 
I wasn't , sure whether I ought to , it felt like too much - and on question twenty - three - " 
" Hermione , " said Ron sternly , " we ' ve been through this before … we ' re not going through every exam afterwards , it's bad enough doing them once . " 
The fifth - years ate lunch with the rest of the school ( the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour ) , then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall , where they were to wait until called for their practical examination . 
As small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order , those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand movements , occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake . 
Hermione's name was called . 
Trembling , she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein , Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass . 
Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards , so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done . 
" She ' ll be fine , remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests ? " said Ron . 
Ten minutes later , Professor Flitwick called , " Parkinson , Pansy - Patil , Padma - Patil , Parvati - Potter , Harry . " 
" Good luck , " said Ron quietly . 
Harry walked into the Great Hall , clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook . 
" Professor Tofty is free , Potter , " squeaked Professor Flitwick , who was standing just inside the door . 
He pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner , a short distance from Professor Marchbanks , who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy . 
" The famous Potter ? " 
Out of the corner of his eye , Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him ; the wine - glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed . 
Harry could not suppress a grin ; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly . 
" That's it , " he said in his quavery old voice , " no need to be nervous . 
Now , if I could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me . " 
His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy's had been , though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color Change and Growth Charms , so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake . 
He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards . 
He could tell Ron , though ; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened . 
There was no time to relax that night ; they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day ; Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories . 
At least he managed to Vanish the whole of his iguana , whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos , causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall . 
They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday ( other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium , Harry felt he had done reasonably well ) ; and then , on Thursday , Defense Against the Dark Arts . 
Here , for the first time , Harry felt sure he had passed . 
He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure , during the practical examination , in performing all the counter - jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge , who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall . 
" Oh , bravo ! " cried Professor Tofty , who was examining Harry again , when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell . 
" Very good indeed ! 
Well , I think that's all , Potter … unless … " 
He leaned forwards a little . 
" I heard , from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden , that you can produce a Patronus ? 
For a bonus point … ? " 
Harry raised his wand , looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked . 
" Expecto patronum ! " 
His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall . 
All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically . 
" Excellent ! " he said . 
" Very well , Potter , you may go ! " 
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door , their eyes met . 
There was a nasty smile playing around her wide , slack mouth , but he did not care . 
Unless he was very much mistaken ( and he was not planning on telling anybody , in case he was ) , he had just achieved an ' Outstanding ' OWL . 
On Friday , Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam , and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision . 
They stretched and yawned beside the open window , through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess . 
Harry could see Hagrid in the distance , teaching a class on the edge of the Forest . 
He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining - he thought it must be unicorns , because the boys seemed to be standing back a little - when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in , looking thoroughly bad - tempered . 
" How were the Runes ? " said Ron , yawning and stretching . 
" I mistranslated ehwaz , " said Hermione furiously . 
" Ah well , " said Ron lazily , " that's only one mistake , isn't it , you ' ll still get - " 
" Oh , shut up ! " said Hermione angrily . 
" It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail . 
And what's more , someone's put another Niffler in Umbridge's office . 
I don't know how they got it through that new door , but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off - by the sound of it , it tried to take a chunk out of her leg - " 
" Good , " said Harry and Ron together . 
" She thinks it's Hagrid doing it , remember ? 
And we do not want Hagrid chucked out ! " 
" He's teaching at the moment ; she can't blame him , " said Harry , gesturing out of the window . 
" Oh , you ' re so naive sometimes , Harry . You really think Umbridge will wait for proof ? " said Hermione , who seemed determined to be in a towering temper , and she swept off towards the girls'dormitories , banging the door behind her . 
" Such a lovely , sweet - tempered girl , " said Ron , very quietly , prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights . 
Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend , though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday , the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least - and which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror . 
Sure enough , he found the written paper difficult , though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion ; he could describe its effects accurately , having taken it illegally in his second year . 
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be . 
With Snape absent from the proceedings , he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions . 
Neville , who was sitting very near Harry , also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class . 
" Only four exams left , " said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room . 
" Only ! " said Hermione snappishly . 
Nobody was foolish enough to snap back , so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first - years for giggling too loudly in the common room . 
Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesdays Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down . 
The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest , where students were required to correctly identify the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs ( the trick was to offer them all milk in turn : Knarls , highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties , generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them ) ; then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle ; feed and clean out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns ; and choose , from a wide selection of food , the diet they would give a sick unicorn . 
Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window . 
When Harry's examiner , a plump little witch this time , smiled at him and told him he could leave , Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs - up before heading back to the castle . 
Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all Jupiter's moons right , but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice . 
They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy ; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination . 
He might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball ; he lost his head completely during tea - leaf reading , saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round , dark , soggy stranger , and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday . 
He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball , only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiner's reflection . 
" We shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place , " said Harry . 
" Still , at least we can give it up now . " 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" And from now on , I don't care if my tea - leaves spell die , Ron , die - I'm just chucking them in the bin where they belong . " 
Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them . 
" Well , I think I ' ve done all right in Arithmancy " she said , and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief . 
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o ' clock , they found a perfect night for stargazing , cloudless and still . 
The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air . 
Each of them set up his or her telescope and , when Professor Marchbanks gave the word , proceeded to fill in the blank star - chart they had been given . 
Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them , watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing . 
All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment , the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand , and the scribbling of many quills . 
Half an hour passed , then an hour ; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished . 
As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart , however , the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing , so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn . 
Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more . 
Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it , now examining Venus . 
He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there , but something distracted him ; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment , he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn . 
If they had not been moving , and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads , they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked . 
Even at this distance , Harry had a funny feeling he recognized the walk of the squattest of them , who seemed to be leading the group . 
He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight , much less accompanied by five others . 
Then somebody coughed behind him , and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam . 
Jamming his eye to his telescope , he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when , alert for any odd sound , he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds , followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog . 
He looked up , his heart hammering . 
There were lights on in Hagrid's windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them . 
The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold . 
The door closed again and there was silence . 
Harry felt very uneasy . 
He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had , but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and , not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work , Harry hastily bent over his starchart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin . 
Figures were now moving across the cabin windows , temporarily blocking the light . 
He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope , staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago , but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower . 
Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin . 
" Try and concentrate , now , boys and girls , " he said softly . 
Harry looked to his left . 
Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin . 
" Ahem - twenty minutes to go , " said Professor Tofty . 
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star - chart ; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as Mars . 
He bent to correct it . 
There was a loud BANG from the grounds . 
Several people cried ' Ouch ! ' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below . 
Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists , surrounded by six people , all of whom , judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction , seemed to be attempting to Stun him . 
" No ! " cried Hermione . 
" My dear ! " said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice . 
" This is an examination ! " 
But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star - charts any more . 
Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid's cabin , yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him ; he was still upright and still , as far as Harry could see , fighting . 
Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang , attempting to defend Hagrid , leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground . 
Hagrid gave a howl of fury , lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him ; the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again . 
Hermione gasped , both hands over her mouth ; Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he , too , was looking scared . 
None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before . 
" Look ! " squealed Parvati , who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again ; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn . 
" Now , really ! " said Professor Tofty anxiously . 
But nobody paid him the slightest attention : they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside Hagrid's cabin . 
" How dare you ! " the figure shouted as she ran . 
" How dare you ! " 
" It's McGonagall ! " whispered Hermione . 
Hermione , Parvati and Lavender all screamed . 
shouted Professor Tofty , who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely . 
" COWARDS ! " bellowed Hagrid , his voice carring clearly to the top of the tower , and several lights flickered back on inside the castle . 
" Oh my — " gasped Hermione . 
Harry saw Hagrid double over , and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell . 
But , on the contrary , next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back - then Harry realized that Fang's limp body was draped around his shoulders . 
" Get him , get him ! " 
screamed Umbridge , but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid's fists ; indeed , he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over . 
Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck . 
Then Professor Tofty's voice said feebly , " Um … five minutes to go , everybody . " 
Though he had only filled in two - thirds of his chart , Harry was desperate for the exam to end . 
When it came at last he , Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase . 
None of the students were going to bed ; they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed . 
" Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night ! " 
" She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's , " said Ernie Macmillan sagely , squeezing over to join them . 
" Its very hard to Stun a giant , they ' re like trolls , really tough … but poor Professor McGonagall … four Stunners straight in the chest and she's not exactly young , is she ? " 
People around them were drifting away , still talking excitedly about what they had just seen . 
" At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban , " said Ron . " I'spect he's gone to join Dumbledore , hasn't he ? " 
" I suppose so , " said Hermione , who looked tearful . 
" Oh , this is awful , I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long , but now we ' ve lost Hagrid too . " 
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full . 
Seamus and Dean , who had arrived ahead of Harry , Ron and Hermione , were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower . 
" But why sack Hagrid now ? " asked Angelina Johnson , shaking her head . 
" And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office , " piped up Katie Bell . 
Fred and George left me a couple ; I ' ve been levitating them in through her window . " 
" She'd have sacked him anyway " said Dean . " He was too close to Dumbledore . " 
" That's true , " said Harry , sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's . 
" I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right , " said Lavender tearfully . 
" They carried her back up to the castle , we watched through the dormitory window , " said Colin Creevey " She didn't look very well . " 
" Madam Pomfrey will sort her out , " said Alicia Spinnet firmly . 
" She's never failed yet . " 
It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared . 
Harry felt wide awake ; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him ; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her , though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast - Ended Skrewts had its merits . 
Their final exam , History of Magic , was not to take place until that afternoon . 
Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast , but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last - minute revision , so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common - room window , trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the notes stacked three - and - ahalf feet high that Hermione had lent him . 
The fifth - years entered the Great Hall at two o ' clock and took their places in front of their facedown examination papers . 
Harry felt exhausted . 
He just wanted this to be over , so that he could go and sleep ; then tomorrow , he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch - he was going to have a fly on Rons broom - and savor their freedom from revision . 
" Turn over your papers , " said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall , flicking over the giant hour - glass . 
" You may begin . " 
Harry stared fixedly at the first question . 
It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it ; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows . 
Slowly , tortuously , he at last began to write an answer . 
He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates . 
He simply skipped question four ( In your opinion , did wand legislation contribute to , or lead to better control of , goblin riots of the eighteenth century ? ) , thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end . 
He had a stab at question five ( How wasthe Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence ? ) but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points ; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere . 
He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten : Describe the circumstances that led to the form ation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join . 
I know this , Harry thought , though his brain felt torpid and slack . 
He began to write , looking up now and again to check the large hour - glass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks . 
He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil , whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair . 
Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly , and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it . 
… the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord , but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein , because - 
The sun was very hot on the back of his head . 
What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein ? 
Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls … he gazed blankly at the back of Parvati's head again . 
If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein … 
Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands , so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool . 
Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll - hunting and give the trolls rights … but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls … that was it . 
He opened his eyes ; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment . 
He closed his eyes again , trying to see them , trying to remember … the Confederation had met for the first time in France , yes , he had written that already … 
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come … 
Think , he told himself , his face in his hands , while all around him quills scratched out neverending answers and the sand trickled through the hour - glass at the front … 
He was walking along the cool , dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again , walking with a firm and purposeful tread , breaking occasionally into a run , determined to reach his destination at last … the black door swung open for him as usual , and here he was in the circular room with its many doors … 
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door … patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking , but no time to explore , he must hurry … 
He jogged the last few feet to the third door , which swung open just like the others … 
Once again he was in the cathedral - sized room full of shelves and glass spheres … his heart was beating very fast now … he was going to get there this time … when he reached number ninetyseven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows … 
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end , a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal … Harry's stomach contracted with fear … with excitement … 
A voice issued from his own mouth , a high , cold voice empty of any human kindness … 
" Take it for me … lift it down , now … I cannot touch it … but you can " 
The black shape on the floor shifted a little . 
Harry saw a long - fingered white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm … heard the high , cold voice say " Crucio ! " 
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain , attempted to stand but fell back , writhing . 
Harry was laughing . 
He raised his wand , the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless . 
" Lord Voldemort is waiting " 
Very slowly , his arms trembling , the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head . 
" You ' ll have to kill me , " whispered Sirius . 
" Undoubtedly I shall in the end , " said the cold voice . 
" But you will fetch it for me first , Black … you think you have felt pain thus far ? 
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again ; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor ; Harry awoke as he hit the ground , still yelling , his scar on fire , as the Great Hall erupted all around him . 
CHAPTER THIRTY - TWO : Out of the Fire 
" I'm not going … I don't need the hospital wing … I don't want " 
He was gibbering as he tried to pull away from Professor Tofty , who was looking at Harry with much concern after helping him out into the Entrance Hall with the students all around them staring . 
" I'm - I'm fine , sir , " Harry stammered , wiping the sweat from his face . 
" Really … I just fell asleep … had a nightmare … " 
" Pressure of examinations ! " said the old wizard sympathetically , patting Harry shakily on the shoulder . 
" It happens , young man , it happens ! 
Now , a cooling drink of water , and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall ? 
" Yes , " said Harry wildly . 
" I mean … no … I ' ve done - done as much as I can , I think … " 
" I shall go and collect your examination paper and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down . " 
" I ' ll do that , " said Harry , nodding vigorously . 
The second that the old man's heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall , Harry ran up the marble staircase , hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches , up more flights of stairs , and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing , causing Madam Pomfrey - who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague's open mouth - to shriek in alarm . 
" Potter , what do you think you ' re doing ? " 
" I need to see Professor McGonagall , " gasped Harry , the breath tearing his lungs . 
" Now … it's urgent ! " 
" She's not here , Potter , " said Madam Pomfrey sadly . 
" She was transferred to St . Mungo's this morning . 
Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age ? 
" She's … gone ? " said Harry , shocked . 
The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him . 
He remained quite still , looking at Madam Pomfrey . 
There was nobody left to tell . 
Dumbledore had gone , Hagrid had gone , but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there , irascible and inflexible , perhaps , but always dependably , solidly present … 
" Yes , " said Harry blankly . 
He wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood , buffeted by the crowd , panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do … 
Ron and Hermione , said a voice in his head . 
He was running again , pushing students out of the way , oblivious to their angry protests . 
He sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him . 
" Harry ! " said Hermione at once , looking very frightened . 
" What happened ? 
Are you all right ? 
Are you ill ? " 
" Where have you been ? " demanded Ron . 
" Come with me , " Harry said quickly . 
" Come on , I ' ve got to tell you something . " 
He led them along the first - floor corridor , peering through doorways , and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived , closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside , and leaned against it , facing them . 
" Voldemort's got Sirius . " 
" What ? " 
" How d ' you - ? " 
" Saw it . 
Just now . 
When I fell asleep in the exam . " 
" But - but where ? 
How ? " said Hermione , whose face was white . 
" I dunno how , " said Harry . 
" But I know exactly where . 
There's a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and they ' re at the end of row ninetyseven … he's trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there … he's torturing him … says he ' ll end by killing him ! " 
He moved over to a desk and sat down on it , trying to master himself . 
" How ' re we going to get there ? " he asked them . 
There was a moment's silence . 
Then Ron said , " G - get there ? " 
" Get to the Department of Mysteries , so we can rescue Sirius ! " 
Harry said loudly . 
" But - Harry … " said Ron weakly . 
" What ? 
What ? " said Harry . 
He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable . 
" Harry , " said Hermione in a rather frightened voice , " er … how … how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there ? " 
" How do I know ? " bellowed Harry . 
" The question is how we ' re going to get in there ! " 
" But … Harry , think about this , " said Hermione , taking a step towards him , " it's five o ' clock in the afternoon … the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers … how would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen ? 
Harry … they ' re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world … you think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected ? " 
Harry shouted . 
" You ' ve never been there , Harry , " said Hermione quietly . 
Harry shouted in her face , standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn . 
He wanted to shake her . 
" How d ' you explain Ron's dad then , what was all that about , how come I knew what had happened to him ? " 
" But why , " Hermione persisted , " why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon , or whatever the thing is ? " 
" You know what , I ' ve just thought of something , " said Ron in a hushed voice . 
" Sirius's brother was a Death Eater , wasn't he ? 
Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon ! " 
" Yeah - and that's why Dumbledore's been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time ! " said Harry . 
" Look , I'm sorry , " cried Hermione , " but neither of you is making sense , and we ' ve got no proof for any of this , no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there - " 
" Okay , " she said , looking frightened yet determined , " I ' ve just got to say this - " 
" What ? " 
But you do … sort of … I mean - don't you think you ' ve got a bit of a - a - saving - people thing ! " she said . 
He glared at her . 
" I mean … last year , for instance … in the lake … during the Tournament … you shouldn't have … I mean , you didn't need to save that little Delacour girl … you got a bit … carried away … " 
" I mean , it was really great of you and everything , " said Hermione quickly , looking positively petrified at the look on Harrys face , " everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do - " 
" That's funny , " said Harry through gritted teeth , " because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero … is that what you think this is ? 
You reckon I want to act the hero again ? " 
" No , no , no ! " said Hermione , looking aghast . 
" That's not what I mean at all ! " 
" Well , spit out what you ' ve got to say , because we ' re wasting time here ! " 
Harry shouted . 
" I'm trying to say - Voldemort knows you , Harry ! 
He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there , it's the kind of thing he does , he knows you ' re the - the sort of person who'd go to Sirius's aid ! 
What if he's just trying to get you into the Department of Myst — ? " 
" Hermione , it doesn't matter if he's done it to get me there or not - they ' ve taken McGonagall to St . Mungo's , there isn't anyone from the Order left at Hogwarts who we can tell , and if we don't go , Sirius is dead ! " 
" But Harry - what if your dream was - was just that , a dream ? " 
Harry let out a roar of frustration . 
Hermione actually stepped back from him , looking alarmed . 
Harry shouted at her , " I'm not having nightmares , I'm not just dreaming ! 
What d ' you think all the Occlumency was for , why d ' you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things ? 
Voldemort's got him , and no one else knows , and that means we ' re the only ones who can save him , and if you don't want to do it , fine , but I'm going , understand ? 
And if I remember rightly , you didn't have a problem with my saving - people thing when it was you I was saving from the Dementors , or - " he rounded on Ron " - when it was your sister I was saving from the Basilisk - " 
" I never said I had a problem ! " said Ron heatedly . 
" But Harry , you ' ve just said it , " said Hermione fiercely , " Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind , if you'd done Occlumency properly you'd never have seen this - " 
" Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind ! " 
The classroom door opened . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione whipped around . 
Ginny walked in , looking curious , closely followed by Luna , who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally . 
" Hi , " said Ginny uncertainly . 
" We recognized Harry's voice . 
What are you yelling about ? " 
" Never you mind , " said Harry roughly . 
Ginny raised her eyebrows . 
" There's no need to take that tone with me , " she said coolly , " I was only wondering whether I could help . " 
" Well , you can't , " said Harry shortly . 
" You ' re being rather rude , you know , " said Luna serenely . 
Harry swore and turned away . 
" Wait , " said Hermione suddenly . 
" Wait … Harry , they can help . " 
Harry and Ron looked at her . 
" Listen , " she said urgently , " Harry , we need to establish whether Sirius really has left Headquarters . " 
" I ' ve told you , I saw - " 
" Harry , I'm begging you , please ! " said Hermione desperately . 
" Please let's just check that Sirius isn't at home before we go charging off to London . 
If we find out he's not there , then I swear I won't try to stop you . 
I ' ll come , I ' ll d - do whatever it takes to try and save him . " 
" Sirius is being tortured NOW ! " shouted Harry . 
" We haven't got time to waste . " 
" But if this is a trick of Voldemort's , Harry , we ' ve got to check , we ' ve got to . " 
" How ? " Harry demanded . 
" How ' re we going to check ? " 
" We ' ll have to use Umbridge's fire and see if we can contact him , " said Hermione , who looked positively terrified at the thought . 
" We ' ll draw Umbridge away again , but we ' ll need lookouts , and that's where we can use Ginny and Luna . " 
Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on , Ginny said immediately , " Yeah , we ' ll do it , " and Luna said , " When you say ' Sirius ' , are you talking about Stubby Boardman ? " 
Nobody answered her . 
" Okay , " Harry said aggressively to Hermione , " Okay , if you can think of a way of doing this quickly , I'm with you , otherwise I'm going to the Department of Mysteries right now . " 
" But how are you going to get there ? " 
Again , Harry ignored her . 
" Right , " said Hermione , twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks . 
" Right … well … one of us has to go and find Umbridge and - and send her off in the wrong direction , keep her away from her office . 
They could tell her - I don't know - that Peeves is up to something awful as usual " 
" I ' ll do it , " said Ron at once . 
" I ' ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something , it's miles away from her office . 
Peeves to do it if I met him on the way . " 
It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department . 
" Now , we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry , or some Slytherins bound to go and tip her off . " 
" Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor , " said Ginny promptly , " and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garrotting Gas . " Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie ; Ginny shrugged and said , " Fred and George were planning to do it before they left . " 
" Okay , " said Hermione . 
" Well then , Harry , you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we ' ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius - " 
" He's not there , Hermione ! " 
" I mean , you can - can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch , I don't think you should be in there alone , Lee's already proved the windows a weak spot , sending those Nifflers through it . " 
Even through his anger and impatience , Harry recognized Hermiones offer to accompany him into Umbridge's office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty . 
" I … okay , thanks , " he muttered . 
" Right , well , even if we do all of that , I don't think we ' re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes , " said Hermione , looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan , " not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around . " 
" Five minutes ' ll be enough , " said Harry . 
" C ' mon , let's go - " 
" Now ? " said Hermione , looking shocked . 
" What did you think , we ' re going to wait until after dinner or something ? 
Hermione , Sirius is being tortured right now ! " 
" I - oh , all right , " she said desperately . 
" You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we ' ll meet you at the end of Umbridge's corridor , okay ? " 
Harry didn't answer , but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside . 
Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean , who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk - till - dawn end - of - exams celebration in the common room . 
Harry barely heard them . 
He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black - market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it , the 
Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky - " 
But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor , and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron , Hermione , Ginny and Luna , who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor . 
" So Ron - you go and head Umbridge off … Ginny , Luna , if you can start moving people out of the corridor … Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear … " 
Ron strode away , his bright - red hair visible right to the end of the passage ; meanwhile Ginnys equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction , trailed by Luna's blonde one . 
" Get over here , " muttered Hermione , tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column . 
" Are - are you sure you ' re okay , Harry ? 
" I'm fine , " he said shortly , tugging the Invisibil i ty Cloak from out of his bag . 
" Here , " he said ; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them . 
Ginny was calling to the crowd . 
" No , sorry , you ' re going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase , someone's let off Garrotting Gas just along here - " 
They could hear people complaining ; one surly voice said , " I can't see no gas . " 
" That's because it's colorless , " said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice , " but if you want to walk through it , carry on , then we ' ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn't believe us . " 
Slowly , the crowd thinned . 
The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread ; people were not coming this way any more . 
Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor . 
As they passed Ginny , Hermione whispered , " Good one … don't forget the signal . " 
" What's the signal ? " 
" A loud chorus of ' Weasly is our King ' if they see Umbridge coming , " replied Hermione , as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall . 
The garish kittens were basking in the late - afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates , but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time . 
" I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler . " 
They pulled off the Cloak ; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight , peering down into the grounds with her wand out . 
Harry dashed over to the fireplace , seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate , causing emerald flames to burst into life there . 
He knelt down quickly , thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried , " Number twelve , Grimmauld Place ! " 
His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fair - ground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor . 
He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long , cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place . 
There was nobody there . 
He had expected this , yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room . 
" Sirius , are you there ? " 
His voice echoed around the room , but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire . 
" Who's there ? " he called , wondering whether it was just a mouse . 
Kreacher the house - elf crept into view . 
" It's the Potter boy's head in the fire , " Kreacher informed the empty kitchen , stealing furtive , oddly triumphant glances at Harry . 
" Where's Sirius , Kreacher ? " 
Harry demanded . 
" Master has gone out , Harry Potter . " 
" Where's he gone ? 
Where's he gone , Kreacher ? " 
" What about Lupin ? 
Any of them , are any of them there ? " 
" Nobody here but Kreacher ! " said the elf gleefully , and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen . 
Harry yelled after the elf . 
" Kreacher , has he gone to the Department of Mysteries ? " 
Kreacher stopped in his tracks . 
Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him . 
" Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going , " said the elf quietly . 
" But you know ! " shouted Harry . 
You know where he is ! " 
" Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries ! " he said gleefully . 
And he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall . 
" You - ! " 
But before he could utter a single curse or insult , Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head ; he inhaled a lot of ash and , choking , found himself being dragged backwards through the flames , until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide , pallid face of Professor Umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go , as though she were going to slit his throat . 
" You think , " she whispered , bending Harry's neck back even further , so that he was looking up at the ceiling , " that after two Nifflers I was going to let one more foul , scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge ? 
Take his wand , " she barked at someone he could not see , and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand . 
Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her . 
" I want to know why you are in my office , " said Umbridge , shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered . 
" I was - trying to get my Firebolt ! " 
Harry croaked . 
She shook his head again . 
" Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons , as you very well know , Potter . 
" No one - " said Harry , trying to pull away from her . 
He felt several hairs part company with his scalp . 
Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode . 
Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill , smirking as he threw Harry's wand into the air one - handed and caught it again . 
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered , each gripping Ron , Ginny , Luna and - to Harry's bewilderment - Neville , who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation . 
" That one , " he poked a thick finger at Neville , " tried to stop me taking her , " he pointed at Ginny , who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her , " so I brought him along too . " 
" Well , it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley - free zone , doesn't it ? " 
Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically . 
Umbridge gave her wide , complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz - covered armchair , blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed . 
" So , Potter , " she said . 
" You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon , " she nodded at Ron — Malfoy laughed even louder - " to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes - Mr . Filch having just informed me so . 
" Clearly , it was very important for you to talk to somebody . 
Or the half - breed , Hagrid ? 
I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall , I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone . " 
Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that . 
Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking . 
Umbridge's slack face seemed to tighten . 
" Very well , " she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice . 
" Very well , Mr Potter … I offered you the chance to tell me freely . 
You refused . 
I have no alternative but to force you . 
Draco fetch Professor Snape . " 
Malfoy stowed Harry's wand inside his robes and left the room smirking , but Harry hardly noticed . 
He had just realized something ; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it . 
He had thought that all the members of the Order , all those who could help him save Sirius , were gone - but he had been wrong . 
There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts - Snape . 
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the Slytherins ' efforts to keep Ron and the others under control . 
Ron's lip was bleeding on to Umbridge's carpet as he struggled against Warrington's half - nelson ; Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth - year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip ; Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe's arms ; and Hermione was attempting , in vain , to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her . 
Luna , however , stood limply by the side of her captor , gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings . 
Harry looked back at Umbridge , who was watching him closely . 
He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy entered the room , closely followed by Snape . 
" You wanted to see me , Headmistress ? " said Snape , looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference . 
" Yes , I would like another bottle of Veritaserum , as quick as you can , please . " 
" Surely you did not use it all ? 
I told you that three drops would be sufficient . " 
" It takes a full moon - cycle to mature , so I should have it ready for you in around a month . " 
" A month ? 
But I need it this evening , Snape ! 
I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown ! " 
" Really ? " said Snape , showing his first , faint sign of interest as he looked round at Harry . 
Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules . " 
His cold , dark eyes were boring into Harry's , who met his gaze unflinchingly , concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream , willing Snape to read it in his mind , to understand … 
" I wish to interrogate him ! " repeated Umbridge angrily , and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face . 
" I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth ! " 
" I have already told you , " said Snape smoothly , " that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum . 
Unless you wish to poison Potter - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did - I cannot help you . 
Snape looked back at Harry , who stared at him , frantic to communicate without words . 
Voldemort's got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries , he thought desperately . Voldemort's got Sirius - 
" You are on probation ! " 
shrieked Professor Umbridge , and Snape looked back at her , his eyebrows slightly raised . 
Now get out of my office ! " 
Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave . 
Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door . 
" Padfoot ? " cried Professor Umbridge , looking eagerly from Harry to Snape . 
" What is Padfoot ? 
What does he mean , Snape ? " 
Snape looked round at Harry . 
His face was inscrutable . 
Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not , but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge . 
" I have no idea , " said Snape coldly . 
" Potter , when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage . 
And Crabbe , loosen your hold a little . 
If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job . " 
He closed the door behind him with a snap , leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before : Snape had been his very last hope . 
He looked at Umbridge , who seemed to be feeling the same way ; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration . 
" Very well , " she said , and she pulled out her wand . 
She seemed to be talking herself into something . 
She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot , staring at Harry , beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily . 
" You are forcing me , Potter … I do not want to , " said Umbridge , still moving restlessly on the spot , " but sometimes circumstances justify the use … I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice . " 
Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face . 
" No ! " shrieked Hermione . 
" Professor Umbridge - it's illegal . " 
There was a nasty , eager , excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before . 
She raised her wand . 
" The Minister wouldn't want you to break the law , Professor Umbridge ! " cried Hermione . 
" What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him , " said Umbridge , who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry's body in turn , apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most . 
" He never knew I ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer , but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him , all the same . " 
" It was you ! " gasped Harry . 
" They were all bleating about silencing you somehow - discrediting you - but I was the one who actually did something about it … only you wriggled out of that one , didn't you , Potter ? 
Not today though , not now - " And taking a deep breath , she cried , " Cruc — " 
" NO ! " shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode . 
" No - Harry - we ' ll have to tell her ! " 
" No way ! " yelled Harry , staring at the little of Hermione he could see . 
" We ' ll have to , Harry , she ' ll force it out of you anyway , what's … what's the point ? " 
And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode's robes . 
Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted . 
Come on then , girl , come on ! " 
" Er - my - nee - no ! " shouted Ron through his gag . 
Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before . 
Neville , still choking for breath , was gazing at her , too . 
But Harry had just noticed something . 
Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands , there was no trace of a tear . 
" I'm - I'm sorry everyone , " said Hermione . 
" But - I can't stand it - " 
" That's right , that's right , girl ! " said Umbridge , seizing Hermione by the shoulders , thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her . 
" Well , " gulped Hermione into her hands , " well , he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore . " 
Fortunately , the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs . 
" Dumbledore ? " said Umbridge eagerly . 
" You know where Dumbledore is , then ? " 
" We ' ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog's Head - " 
wailed Hermione , holding her hands more tightly over her face , not , Harry knew , out of anguish , but to disguise the continued absence of tears . 
" What was it you wanted to tell him ? " 
" What's ready ? " demanded Umbridge , and now she grabbed Hermione's shoulders again and shook her slightly . 
" What's ready , girl ? " 
" The … the weapon , " said Hermione . 
" Weapon ? Weapon ? " said Umbridge , and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement . 
A weapon you could use against the Ministry ? 
On Professor Dumbledore's orders , of course ? " 
" Y — y - yes , " gasped Hermione , " but he had to leave before it was finished and n - n - now we ' ve finished it for him , and we c - c - can't find him t - t - to tell him ! " 
" What kind of weapon is it ? " said Umbridge harshly , her stubby hands still tight on Hermione's shoulders . 
Umbridge straightened up , looking exultant . 
" Lead me to the weapon , " she said . 
" I'm not showing … them , " said Hermione shrilly , looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers . 
" Fine … let them see it , I hope they use it on you ! 
In fact , I wish you'd invite loads and loads of people to come and see ! Th - that would serve you right - oh , I'd love it if the wh - whole school knew where it was , and how to u - use it , and then if you annoy any of them they ' ll be able to s - sort you out ! " 
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge : she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad , her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy , who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face . 
Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment , then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice . 
" All right , dear , let's make it just you and me … and we ' ll take Potter , too , shall we ? Get up , now . " 
" Professor , " said Malfoy eagerly , " Professor Umbridge , I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after - " 
" I am a fully qualified Ministry official , Malfoy , do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone ? " 
" In any case , it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see . 
You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these - " she gestured around at Ron , Ginny , Neville and Luna " - escape . " 
" All right , " said Malfoy , looking sulky and disappointed . 
" And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way " said Umbridge , pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand . 
" Lead on . " 
Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning , or even whether she had a plan . 
He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge's office , knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going . 
He did not dare attempt to talk to her ; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing . 
Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall . 
The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall - it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner , celebrating the end of exams , not a care in the world … 
Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air . 
The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now , and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass - Umbridge jogging to keep up - their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks . 
" It's hidden in Hagrid's hut , is it ? " said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear . 
" Of course not , " said Hermione scathingly . 
" Yes , he would have done , of course , the great half - breed oaf . " 
She laughed . 
Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat , but resisted . 
His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white - hot , as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill . 
" Then … where is it ? " 
asked Umbridge , with a hint of uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride towards the Forest . 
" It had to be somewhere that students weren't going to find it accidentally , didn't it ? " 
" Of course … very well , then … you two stay ahead of me . " 
Harry asked her . 
As they reached the cool shade of the first trees , Harry tried to catch Hermiones eye ; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening . 
She , however , merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees , moving at such a pace that Umbridge , with her shorter legs , had difficulty in keeping up . 
" Oh yes , " said Hermione , " yes , it's well hidden . " 
Harry's misgivings increased . 
Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp , but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog . 
Hermione had not been with him on that occasion ; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it . 
" Er - are you sure this is the right way ? " he asked her pointedly . 
" Oh yes , " she said in a steely voice , crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise . 
Neither of them paused to help her up again ; Hermione merely strode on , calling loudly over her shoulder , " It's a bit further in ! " 
" I want us heard , " she answered quietly , as Umbridge jogged noisily after them . 
" You ' ll see … " 
They walked on for what seemed a long time , until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light . 
Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest , one of being watched by unseen eyes . 
demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him . 
" Not far now ! " shouted Hermione , as they emerged into a dim , dank clearing . 
" Just a little bit - " 
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head . 
The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves ; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling ; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield - 
He wrenched himself free of her and turned . 
Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side , their bows raised and loaded , pointing at Harry Hermione and Umbridge . 
They backed slowly into the center of the clearing , Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror . 
Harry looked sideways at Hermione . 
" Who are you ? " said a voice . 
Harry looked left . 
The chestnut - bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out of the circle : his bow , like those of the others , was raised . 
On Harry's right , Umbridge was still whimpering , her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur . 
" I asked you who are you , human , " said Magorian rou ghly . 
" Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts ! " 
" You are from the Ministry of Magic ? " said Magorian , as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly . 
" That's right ! " said Umbridge , in an even higher voice , " so be very careful ! 
By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , any attack by half - breeds such as yourselves on a human - " 
" What did you call us ? " shouted a wild - looking black centaur , whom Harry recognized as Bane . 
Hermione said furiously , but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her . 
" ' Near - human intelligence ' ? " repeated Magorian , as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground . 
" What are you doing in our Forest ? " 
bellowed the hard - faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the Forest . 
" Why are you here ? " 
" I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land - " 
An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing : she let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head , while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously . 
The sound of their wild , neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving . 
" Be quiet ! " shouted Hermione , but it was too late : Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed , " Incarcerous ! " 
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes , wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur's torso and trapping his arms : he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs , attempting to free himself , while the other centaurs charged . 
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground ; face down on the Forest floor , he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him , but the centaurs leapt over and around them , bellowing and screaming with rage . 
Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to Stun one of them ; then she screamed very loudly . 
Lifting his head a few inches , Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air , wriggling and yelling with fright . 
Her wand fell from her hand to the ground , and Harry's heart leapt . 
If he could just reach it - 
But as he stretched out a hand towards it , a centaur's hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half . 
Over the plunging , many - colored backs and heads of the centaurs , Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane . 
Screaming non - stop , her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them . 
" They are young , " said a slow , doleful voice from behind Harry . 
" We do not attack foals . " 
He shook Harry by the neck of his robes . 
We only came in here because we hoped you'd drive her off for us . " 
Harry knew at once , from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding Hermione , that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this . 
The grey centaur threw back his head , his back legs stamping furiously , and bellowed , " You see , Ronan ? 
They already have the arrogance of their kind ! 
We were to act as your servants , drive away your enemies like obedient hounds ? " 
" No ! " said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak . 
" Please - I didn't mean that ! 
I just hoped you'd be able to - to help us - " 
But she seemed to be going from bad to worse . 
" We do not help humans ! " 
snarled the centaur holding Harry , tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time , so that Harry's feet left the ground momentarily . 
" We are a race apart and proud to be so . 
We will not permit you to walk from here , boasting that we did your bidding ! " 
" We're not going to say anything like that ! " Harry shouted . 
" We know you didn't do what you did because we wanted you to - " 
But nobody seemed to be listening to him . 
A bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted , " They came here unasked , they must pay the consequences ! " 
A roar of approval met these words and a dun - colored centaur shouted , " They can join the woman ! " 
" We haven't done anything to hurt you , we haven't used wands or threats , we just want to go back to school , please let us go back - " 
" We are not all like the traitor Firenze , human girl ! " shouted the grey centaur , to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows . 
We do not recognize your laws , we do not acknowledge your superiority , we are - " 
But they did not hear what else centaurs were , for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them , Harry , Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing , looked around . 
Harry's centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows . 
Hermione had been dropped , too , and Harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap . 
The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind ; the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired , all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches . 
Grawp's lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly ; they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half - light , his dull sludgecolored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet . 
He opened his mouth even wider . 
" Hagger . " 
Harry did not know what ' hagger ' meant , or what language it was from , nor did he much care ; he was watching Grawp's feet , which were almost as long as Harry's whole body . 
Hermione gripped his arm tightly ; the centaurs were quite silent , staring up at the giant , whose huge , round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped . 
" Hagger ! " he said again , more insistently . 
" Harry ! " she whispered . 
" I think he's trying to say ' Hagrid ' ! " 
At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them , the only two humans in a sea of centaurs . 
He lowered his head another foot or so , staring intently at them . 
Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said , in a deep , rumbling voice , " Hermy . " 
" Goodness , " said Hermione , gripping Harry's arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint , " he - he remembered ! " 
" HERMY ! " roared Grawp . 
" I'm sorry , Grawp , I don't know ! " 
" GRAWP WANT HAGGER ! " 
One of the giant's massive hands reached down . 
Hermione let out a real scream , ran a few steps backwards and fell over . 
Devoid of a wand , Harry braced himself to punch , kick , bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a snow - white centaur off his legs . 
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp's outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant , peppering his enormous face , causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up , rubbing his face with his enormous hands , breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper . 
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way ; pebble - sized droplets of Grawp's blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees . 
Once there they looked back ; Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his face ; they were retreating in disorder , galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing . 
" Oh no , " said Hermione , quaking so badly that her knees gave way . 
And he might kill them all . " 
" I'm not that fussed , to be honest , " said Harry bitterly . 
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter . 
As Harry listened to them , his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him . 
Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever . 
" Really smart plan . 
" We need to get back up to the castle , " said Hermione faintly . 
" By the time we ' ve done that , Sirius ' ll probably be dead ! " said Harry , kicking a nearby tree in temper . 
A high - pitched chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him . 
" Anyway , Harry , how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London ? " 
" Yeah , we were just wondering that , " said a familiar voice from behind her . 
Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees . 
Ron came into sight , closely followed by Ginny , Neville and Luna . 
All of them looked a little the worse for wear - there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny's cheek ; a large purple lump was swelling above Neville's right eye ; Ron's lip was bleeding worse than ever - but all were looking rather pleased with themselves . 
" So , " said Ron , pushing aside a low - hanging branch and holding out Harry's wand , " had any ideas ? " 
asked Harry in amazement , taking his wand from Ron . 
Anyway , we saw you out of the window heading into the Forest and followed . 
" She got carried away , " said Harry . 
" No , they got chased off by Grawp , " said Harry 
" Who's Grawp ? " Luna asked interestedly . 
" Anyway , never mind that now . 
Harry , what did you find out in the fire ? 
" Yes , " said Harry , as his scar gave another painful prickle , " and I'm sure Sirius is still alive , but I can't see how we ' re going to get there to help him . " 
" Well , we ' ll have to fly , won't we ? " said Luna , in the closest thing to a matter - of - fact voice Harry had ever heard her use . 
" I ' ve got a broom ! " said Ginny . 
" Excuse me , but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do ! " said Ginny , her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking . 
" Yeah , but - " 
And this is the first chance we ' ve had to do something real - or was that all just a game or something ? " 
" No — of course it wasn't - " said Harry impatiently . 
" Then we should come too , " said Neville simply . 
" We want to help . " 
" That's right , " said Luna , smiling happily . 
Harry's eyes met Ron's . 
He knew Ron was thinking exactly what he was : if he could have chosen any members of the D . A . , in addition to himself , Ron and Hermione , to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius , he would not have picked Ginny , Neville or Luna . 
" Well , it doesn't matter , anyway , " said Harry through gritted teeth , " because we still don't know how to get there - " 
" I s ' pose we ' re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is ? " Ron demanded . 
" The Crumple - Horned Snorkack can't fly , " said Luna in a dignified voice , " but they can , and Hagrid says they ' re very good at finding places their riders are looking for . " 
Harry whirled round . 
Standing between two trees , their white eyes gleaming eerily , were two Thestrals , watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word . 
They tossed their reptilian heads , throwing back long black manes , and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck ; how could he ever have thought them ugly ? 
" Is it those mad horse things ? " said Ron uncertainly , staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting . 
" Yeah , " said Harry . 
" How many ? " 
" Just two . " 
" Four , Hermione , " said Ginny , scowling . 
" I think there are six of us , actually , " said Luna calmly , counting . 
" Look , you three - " he pointed at Neville , Ginny and Luna , " you ' re not involved in this , you ' re not - " 
" Okay , fine , it's your choice , " he said curtly , " but unless we can find more Thestrals you ' re not going to be able - " 
" Oh , more of them will come , " said Ginny confidently , who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction , apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses . 
" What makes you think that ? " 
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve , which was damp with Grawp's blood . 
" Okay , then , " he said , a bright idea occurring , " Ron and I will take these two and go ahead , and Hermione can stay here with you three and she ' ll attract more Thestrals - " 
" I'm not staying behind ! " said Hermione furiously . 
Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral , placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horses silken back . 
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure , then looked around at the others . 
Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back . 
Luna was already in place , sitting side - saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day . 
Ron , Hermione and Ginny , however , were still standing motionless on the spot , open - mouthed and staring . 
" What ? " he said . 
" How ' re we supposed to get on ? " said Ron faintly . 
" When we can't see the things ? " 
" Oh , it's easy , " said Luna , sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him , Hermione and Ginny . 
" Come here … " 
She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount . 
All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed . 
" Mad … if I could just see it - " 
" We all ready , then ? " 
He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed . 
" Ministry of Magic , visitors ' entrance , London , then , " he said uncertainly . 
" Er … if you know … where to go … " 
For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all ; then , with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him , the wings on either side extended ; the horse crouched slowly , then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump . 
He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horse's silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood - red sunset . 
Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast : the Thestral streaked over the castle , its wide wings hardly beating ; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face ; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind , he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him , each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream . 
They were over the Hogwarts grounds , they had passed Hogsmeade ; Harry could see mountains and gullies below them . 
As the daylight began to fail , Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages , then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills … 
" This is bizarre ! " 
Twilight fell : the sky was turning to a light , dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars , and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were , or how very fast they were traveling . 
Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horses neck as he willed it to go even faster . 
How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor ? 
How much longer would Sinus be able to resist Voldemort ? 
All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted , nor died , for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body , making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr . Weasley was attacked . 
On they flew through the gathering darkness ; Harry's face felt stiff and cold , his legs numb from gripping the Thestrals sides so tightly , but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip … he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears , and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind . 
He had lost all sense of how far they had come ; all his faith was in the beast beneath him , still streaking purposefully through the night , barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards . 
If they were too late … 
He's still alive , he's still fighting , I can feel it … 
I'd know … 
Harrys stomach gave a jolt ; the Thestrals head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck . 
They were descending at last … he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously , but could see no sign of a falling body … presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction , just as he had . 
Quite suddenly , it seemed , they were hurtling towards the pavement ; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength , braced for a sudden impact , but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back , looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box , both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights . 
Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement . 
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him : both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron , though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground ; Neville jumped down , shaking ; and Luna dismounted smoothly . 
" Where do we go from here , then ? " she asked Harry in a politely interested voice , as though this was all a rather interesting day - trip . 
" Over here , " he said . 
He gave his Thestral a quick , grateful pat , then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door . 
" Come on ! " he urged the others , as they hesitated . 
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently ; Hermione , Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them ; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals , now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip , then forced himself into the box after Luna . 
Ron did it , his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial ; as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box . 
" Welcome to the Ministry of Magic . 
Please state your name and business . " 
" Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , Hermione Granger , " Harry said very quickly , " Ginny Weasley , Neville Longbottom , Luna Lovegood … we ' re here to save someone , unless your Ministry can do it first ! " 
" Thank you , " said the cool female voice . 
" Visitors , please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes . " 
Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head ; he glanced at the topmost one , Harry Potter , Rescue Mission . 
" Visitors to the Ministry , you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk , which is located at the far end of the Atrium . " 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows ; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight ; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic . 
Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium , but it seemed to be completely empty . 
The light was dimmer than it had been by day ; there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls , but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling . 
" The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening , " said the woman's voice . 
The door of the telephone box burst open ; Harry toppled out of it , closely followed by Neville and Luna . 
The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain , where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard , the point of the centaur's arrow , the tip of the goblin's hat and the house - elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool . 
" Come on , " said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall , Harry in the lead , past the fountain towards the desk where the security man who had weighed Harry's wand had sat , and which was now deserted . 
Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there , sure that their absence was an ominous sign , and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts . 
He pressed the nearest'down ' button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately , the golden grilles slid apart with a great , echoing clanking and they dashed inside . 
Harry stabbed the number nine button ; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend , jangling and rattling . 
Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with Mr . Weasley ; he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building , yet when the lift halted , the cool female voice said , " Department of Mysteries , " and the grilles slid open . 
They stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches , flickering in the rush of air from the lift . 
Harry turned towards the plain black door . 
After months and months of dreaming about it , he was here at last . 
" Let's go , " he whispered , and he led the way down t he corridor , Luna right behind him , gazing around with her mouth slightly open . 
" Okay , listen , " said Harry stopping again within six feet of the door . 
" Maybe … maybe a couple of people should stay here as a — as a lookout , and — " 
" We're coming with you , Harry , " said Neville . 
" Let's get on with it , " said Ron firmly . 
Harry still did not want to take them all with him , but it seemed he had no choice . 
He turned to face the door and walked forwards … just as it had in his dream , it swung open and he marched over the threshold , the others at his heels . 
They were standing in a large , circular room . 
Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling ; identical , unmarked , handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls , interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue ; their cool , shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot . 
" Someone shut the door , " Harry muttered . 
Without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them , the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor . 
In his dream , Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on . 
But there were around a dozen doors here . 
Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him , trying to decide which was the right one , there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways . 
The circular wall was rotating . 
Hermione grabbed Harry's arm as though frightened the floor might move , too , but it did not . 
For a few seconds , the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around ; then , quite as suddenly as it had started , the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again . 
Harry's eyes had blue streaks burned into them ; it was all he could see . 
" What was that about ? " whispered Ron fearfully . 
" I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through , " said Ginny in a hushed voice . 
Harry realized at once she was right : he could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant on the jet - black floor ; and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them . 
" Well , that doesn't matter now , " said Harry forcefully , blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision , and clutching his wand tighter than ever , " we won't need to get out till we ' ve found Sirius - " 
Hermione said urgently ; but Harry had never needed her advice less , his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible . 
" Where do we go , then , Harry ? " Ron asked . 
" I don't - " Harry began . 
He swallowed . 
" In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room - that's this one - and then I went through another door into a room that kind of … glitters . 
We should try a few doors , " he said hastily , " I ' ll know the right way when I see it . 
He marched straight at the door now facing him , the others following close behind him , set his left hand against its cool , shining surface , raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened , and pushed . 
After the darkness of the first room , the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter , though there were no glittering , shimmering lights as Harry had seen in his dreams . 
The place was quite empty except for a few desks and , in the very middle of the room , an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid , big enough for all of them to swim in ; a number of pearly - white objects were drifting around lazily in it . 
" What ' re those things ? " 
whispered Ron . 
" Dunno , " said Harry . 
" Are they fish ? " 
" Aquavirius Maggots ! " said Luna excitedly . 
" No , " said Hermione . 
She moved forward to look through the side of the tank . 
" Yes … I wonder what they ' re doing with them ? " 
Harry joined her at the tank . 
Glimmering eerily , they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid , looking something like slimy cauliflowers . 
" Let's get out of here , " said Harry . 
" This isn't right , we need to try another door . " 
" There are doors here , too , " said Ron , pointing around the walls . 
Harry's heart sank ; how big was this place ? 
" In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one , " he said . 
" I think we should go back and try from there . " 
So they hurried back into the dark , circular room ; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry's eyes instead of the blue candle flames . 
" Wait ! " said Hermione sharply , as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them . 
" Flagrate ! " 
She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery ' X ' appeared on the door . 
No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling , and once again the wall began to revolve very fast , but now there was a great red - gold blur in amongst the faint blue and , when all became still again , the fiery cross still burned , showing the door they had already tried . 
" Good thinking , " said Harry . 
Again , he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open , his wand still raised , the others at his heels . 
This room was larger than the last , dimly lit and rectangular , and the center of it was sunken , forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep . 
They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre , or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot . 
Instead of a chained chair , however , there was a raised stone dais in the center of the pit , on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient , cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing . 
Unsupported by any surrounding wall , the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which , despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air , was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched . 
" Who's there ? " said Harry , jumping down on to the bench below . 
There was no answering voice , but the veil continued to flutter and sway . 
" Careful ! " whispered Hermione . 
Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit . 
The pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when he'd been looking down on it from above . 
" Sirius ? " Harry spoke again , but more quietly now that he was nearer . 
He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway . 
Gripping his wand very tightly , he edged around the dais , but there was nobody there ; all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil . 
" Let's go , " called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps . 
" This isn't right , Harry , come on , let's go . " 
She sounded scared , much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam , yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it , old though it was . 
The gently rippling veil intrigued him ; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it . 
" Harry , let's go , okay ? " said Hermione more forcefully . 
He had just heard something . 
There were faint whispering , murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil . 
" What are you saying ? " he said , very loudly , so that his words echoed all around the stone benches . 
" Someone's whispering behind there , " he said , moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil . 
" Is that you , Ron ? " 
" I'm here , mate , " said Ron , appearing around the side of the archway . 
Harry demanded , for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder ; without really meaning to put it there , he found his foot was on the dais . 
" I can hear them too , " breathed Luna , joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil . 
Harry , stop it , come away - " 
She grabbed his arm and pulled , but he resisted . 
" Harry , we are supposed to be here for Sirius ! " she said in a high - pitched , strained voice . 
" Yeah … " 
Something finally slid back into place in his brain ; Sirius , captured , bound and tortured , and he was staring at this archway … 
He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil . 
" Let's go , " he said . 
" That's what I ' ve been trying to - well , come on , then ! " said Hermione , and she led the way back around the dais . 
On the other side , Ginny and Neville were staring , apparently entranced , at the veil too . 
Without speaking , Hermione took hold of Ginny's arm , Ron grabbed Neville's , and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door . 
" What d ' you reckon that arch was ? " Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room . 
" I don't know , but whatever it was , it was dangerous , " she said firmly , again inscribing a fiery cross on the door . 
Once more , the wall span and became still again . 
Harry approached another door at random and pushed . 
It did not move . 
" What's wrong ? " said Hermione . 
" It's … locked … " said Harry , throwing his weight at the door , but it didn't budge . 
" This is it , then , isn't it ? " said Ron excitedly , joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open . 
" Bound to be ! " 
" Get out of the way ! " said Hermione sharply . 
She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said , " Alohomora ! " 
Nothing happened . 
" Sirius's knife ! " said Harry . 
He pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall . 
What was more , when Harry looked down at the knife , he saw the blade had melted . 
" But what if that's the one ? " said Ron , staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing . 
" It can't be , Harry could get through all the doors in his dream , " said Hermione , marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now - useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket . 
" You know what could be in there ? " said Luna eagerly , as the wall started to spin yet again . 
" Something blibbering , no doubt , " said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh . 
The wall slid to a halt and Harry , with a feeling of increasing desperation , pushed the next door open . 
" This is it ! " 
He knew it at once by the beautiful , dancing , diamond - sparkling light . 
As Harrys eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare , he saw clocks gleaming from every surface , large and small , grandfather and carriage , hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room , so that a busy , relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule , marching footsteps . 
The source of the dancing , diamond - bright light was a towering crystal ball jar that stood at the far end of the room . 
" This way ! " 
Harry's heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track ; he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks , heading , as he had done in his dream , for the source of the light , the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing , glittering wind . 
" Oh , look ! " said Ginny , as they drew nearer , pointing at the very heart of the bell jar . 
As it rose in the jar , it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged , which was carried to the very top of the jar , but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again , and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg . 
" Keep going ! " said Harry sharply , because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird . 
" You dawdled enough by that old arch ! " she said crossly , but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it . 
" This is it , " Harry said again , and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech , " it's through here - " 
He glanced around at them all ; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious . 
He looked back at the door and pushed . 
They were there , they had found the place : high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small , dusty , glass orbs . 
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle - brackets set at intervals along the shelves . 
The room was very cold . 
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves . 
" You said it was row ninety - seven , " whispered Hermione . 
" Yeah , " breathed Harry , looking up at the end of the closest row . 
Beneath the branch of blueglowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure fifty - three . 
" We need to go right , I think , " whispered Hermione , squinting to the next row . 
They crept forward , glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves , the further ends of which were in near - total darkness . 
They passed row eighty - four … eighty - five … Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement , but Sirius might be gagged now , or else unconscious … or , said an unbidden voice inside his head , he might already be dead … 
" Ninety - seven ! " whispered Hermione . 
They stood grouped around the end of the row , gazing down the alley beside it . 
" He's right down at the end , " said Harry , whose mouth had become slightly dry . 
" He should be near here , " whispered Harry , convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor . 
" Harry ? " said Hermione tentatively , but he did not want to respond . 
His mouth was very dry . 
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight . 
" Or maybe … " He hurried to look down the one beyond that . 
" Harry ? " said Hermione again . 
" What ? " he snarled . 
" I … I don't think Sirius is here . " 
Harry did not want to look at any of them . 
He felt sick . 
He did not understand why Sirius was not here . 
He had to be here . 
He ran up the space at the end of the rows , staring down them . 
There was no sign of Sirius anywhere , nor any hint of a struggle . 
" Harry ? " Ron called . 
" What ? " 
He did not want to hear what Ron had to say ; did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts , but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others ' accusing stares … 
" Have you seen this ? " said Ron , 
" What ? " said Harry , but eagerly this time - it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there , a clue . 
He strode back to where they were all standing , a little way down row ninety - seven , but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf . 
" What ? " Harry repeated glumly . 
" It's — it's got your name on , " said Ron . 
Harry moved a little closer . 
Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light , though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years . 
" My name ? " said Harry blankly . 
He stepped forwards . 
Not as tall as Ron , he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball . 
S . P . T . to A . P . W . B . D . 
Dark Lord and ( ? ) Harry Potter 
Harry stared at it . 
" What is it ? " 
He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf . 
" I'm not here , " he said , sounding perplexed . 
" None of the rest of us are here . " 
" Harry , I don't think you should touch it , " said Hermione sharply , as he stretched out his hand . 
" Why not ? " he said . 
" Don't , Harry , " said Neville suddenly . 
Harry looked at him . 
" It's got my name on , " said Harry . 
He had expected it to feel cold , but it did not . 
On the contrary , it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours , as though the glow of light within was warming it . 
Expecting , even hoping , that something dramatic was going to happen , something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile after all , Harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it . 
The others moved in closer around Harry , gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust . 
And then , from right behind them , a drawling voice spoke . 
" Very good , Potter . 
Now turn around , nice and slowly , and give that to me . " 
" To me , " said Malfoy yet again . 
" Where's Sirius ? " 
Harry said . 
Several of the Death Eaters laughed ; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly , " The Dark Lord always knows ! " 
" Now , give me the prophecy Potter . " 
" I want to know where Sirius is ! " 
" I want to know where Sirius is ! " mimicked the woman to his left . 
She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others , the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes . 
" You ' ve got him , " said Harry , ignoring the rising panic in his chest , the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety - seventh row . 
" He's here . 
I know he is . " 
Harry felt Ron stir beside him . 
" Don't do anything , " Harry muttered . 
" Not yet - " 
" Oh , you don't know Potter as I do , Bellatrix , " said Malfoy softly . 
" He has a great weakness for heroics ; the Dark Lord understands this about him . 
Now give me the prophecy , Potter . " 
" I know you ' ve got him ! " 
More of the Death Eaters laughed , though the woman laughed loudest of all . 
" It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams , Potter , " said Malfoy . 
" Go on , then , " said Harry , raising his own wand to chest height . 
As he did so , the five wands of Ron , Hermione , Neville , Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him . 
The knot in Harry's stomach tightened . 
If Sirius really was not here , he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all … 
But the Death Eaters did not strike . 
" Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt , " said Malfoy coolly . 
It was Harry's turn to laugh . 
" Yeah , right ! " he said . 
" I give you this - prophecy , is it ? 
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked : " Accio proph — " 
before she had finished her spell , and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it . 
" Oh , he knows how to play , little bitty baby Potter , " she said , her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood . 
" If you smash it - ! " 
Harry's mind was racing . 
The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun - glass sphere . 
He had no interest in it . 
He just wanted to get them all out of this alive , to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity … 
The woman stepped forward , away from her fellows , and pulled off her hood . 
Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face , making it gaunt and skull - like , but it was alive with a feverish , fanatical glow . 
I ' ll do it . " 
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny ; he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her , the prophecy held up to his chest . 
" You ' ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us , " he told Bellatrix . 
" I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it , will he ? " 
She did not move ; she merely stared at him , the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth . 
" So , " said Harry , " what kind of prophecy are we talking about , anyway ? " 
He could not think what to do but to keep talking . 
Neville's arm was pressed against his , and he could feel him shaking ; he could feel one of the others ' quickened breath on the back of his head . 
He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this , because his mind was blank . 
" What kind of prophecy ? " 
repeated Bellatrix , the grin fading from her face . 
" You jest , Harry Potter . " 
" Nope , not jesting , " said Harry , his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater , looking for a weak link , a space through which they could escape . 
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses . 
" You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips , you dare besmirch it with your half - blood's tongue , you dare - " 
" Did you know he's a half - blood too ? " said Harry recklessly . 
Yeah , his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle - or has he been telling you lot he's pure - blood ? " 
" NO ! " 
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand , but Malfoy had deflected it ; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered . 
Two figures , pearly - white as ghosts , fluid as smoke , unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak ; their voices vied with each other , so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts . 
" … at the solstice will come a new … " said the figure of an old , bearded man . 
Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor . 
The problem was going to be conveying it to the others . 
" Do not play games with us , Potter , " said Malfoy . 
" I'm not playing games , " said Harry , half his mind on the conversation , half on his wandering foot . 
A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermiones . 
" What ? " she whispered . 
" Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries ? " 
" I - what ? " said Harry . 
And for a moment he quite forgot his plan . 
" What about my scar ? " 
" What ? " whispered Hermione more urgently behind him . 
" Dumbledore never told you ? " Malfoy repeated . 
" Well , this explains why you didn't come earlier , Potter , the Dark Lord wondered why - " 
" - when I say now - " 
" Did he ? " said Harry . 
Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking , to distract the Death Eaters . 
" So he wanted me to come and get it , did he ? 
Why ? " 
" Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries , Potter , are those about whom it was made , as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him . " 
" And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me ? " 
" About both of you , Potter , about both of you … haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby ? " 
Harry stared into the slitted eye - holes through which Malfoy's grey eyes were gleaming . 
Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand ? 
" Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me ? " he said quietly , gazing at Lucius Malfoy , his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand . 
" And he's made me come and get it for him ? 
Why couldn't he come and get it himself ? " 
" The Dark Lord , walk into the Ministry of Magic , when they are so sweetly ignoring his return ? 
The Dark Lord , reveal himself to the Aurors , when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin ? " 
" So , he's got you doing his dirty work for him , has he ? " said Harry . 
" Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it - and Bode ? " 
" Very good , Potter , very good … " said Malfoy slowly . 
" But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell — " 
" NOW ! " yelled Harry . 
Five different voices behind him bellowed , " REDUCTO ! " 
Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit ; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart , pearly - white figures unfurled into the air and floated there , their voices echoing from who knew what long - dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor - 
" RUN ! " Harry yelled , as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above . 
He seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forwards , holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them . 
A Death Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face ; they were all yelling , there were cries of pain , and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves , weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres - 
Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron , Ginny and Luna sprint past him , their arms over their heads ; something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards ; a hand caught him by the shoulder ; he heard Hermione shout , " Stupefy ! " 
They were at the end of row ninety - seven ; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest ; he could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on ; straight ahead , the door through which they had come was ajar ; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar ; he pelted through the doorway , the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand , and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them - 
" Colloportus ! " gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise . 
" Where - where are the others ? " 
gasped Harry . 
He had thought Ron , Luna and Ginny were ahead of them , that they would be waiting in this room , but there was nobody there . 
" They must have gone the wrong way ! " whispered Hermione , terror in her face . 
" Listen ! " whispered Neville . 
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed ; Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar , " Leave Nott , leave him , I say — his injuries will be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy . 
Jugson , come back here , we need to organize ! 
We ' ll split into pairs and search , and don't forget , be gentle with Potter until we ' ve got the prophecy , you can kill the others if necessary - Bellatrix , Rodolphus , you take the left ; Crabbe , Rabastan , go right - Jugson , Dolohov , the door straight ahead - Macnair and Avery , through here - Rookwood , over there - Mulciber , come with me ! " 
" What do we do ? " Hermione asked Harry , trembling from head to foot . 
" Well , we don't stand here waiting for them to find us , for a start , " said Harry . 
They ran as quietly as they could , past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching , towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room . 
" Stand aside ! " said a rough voice . 
As the door flew open , Harry , Hermione and Neville dived under desks . 
They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters ' robes drawing nearer , their feet moving rapidly . 
" They might ' ve run straight through to the hall , " said the rough voice . 
" Check under the desks , " said another . 
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend ; poking his wand out from under the desk , he shouted , " STUPEFY ! " 
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater ; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over ; the second Death Eater , however , had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione , who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim . 
Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees , causing him to topple and his aim to go awry . 
Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help ; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair , he cried : 
" EXPELLIARMUS ! " 
Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy ; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them , the Death Eater in front , Harry hot on his heels , and Neville bringing up the rear , plainly horrorstruck by what he had done . 
" Get out of the way , Harry ! " yelled Neville , clearly determined to repair the damage . 
" STUPEFY ! " 
The jet of red light had flown right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass - fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour - glasses ; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart , glass flying everywhere , sprang back up on to the wall , fully mended , then fell down again , and shattered - 
The Death Eater had snatched up his wand , which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar . 
He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted : " STUP — " 
The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest : he froze , his arm still raised , his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar . 
Harry expected to hear a dunk , for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor , but instead , his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest , sprawled on his back on the table , with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind . 
" Accio wand ! " cried Hermione . 
Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him . 
" Thanks , " he said . 
He was staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar . 
All three of them raised their wands again , but none of them struck : they were all gazing , openmouthed , appalled , at what was happening to the man's head . 
It was shrinking very fast , growing balder and balder , the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull ; his cheeks becoming smooth , his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz … 
A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick , muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again ; but even as they watched , their mouths open , the head began to swell to its previous proportions again ; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin … 
" It's Time , " said Hermione in an awestruck voice . 
" Time … " 
The Death Eater shook his ugly head again , trying to clear it , but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more … 
There was a shout from a room nearby , then a crash and a scream . 
" Harry ! " Hermione screamed . 
The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar . 
Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm . 
" You can't hurt a baby ! " 
There was no time to argue the point ; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew , too late , that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position . 
" Come on ! " he said , and leaving the ugly baby - headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room , leading back into the black hallway . 
They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them ; veering left , he burst instead into a small , dark , cluttered office and slammed the door behind them . 
" Collo — " began Hermione , but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside . 
Harry , Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet ; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view ; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books ; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him , tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react . 
" Silencio ! " cried Hermione and the man's voice was extinguished . 
He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask , but no sound came out . 
He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater . 
" Petrificus Totalus ! " shouted Harry , as the second Death Eater raised his wand . 
His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards , face down on to the rug at Harry's feet , stiff as a board and unable to move . 
" Well done , Ha — " 
But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand ; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione's chest . 
She gave a tiny " Oh ! " as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor , where she lay motionless . 
" HERMIONE ! " 
Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk , his wand held up in front of him . 
The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged - his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face . 
Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled , clutching his mouth and nose . 
Harry twisted around , his own wand held high , and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry , who recognized the long , pale , twisted face from the Daily Prophet : Antonin Dolohov , the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts . 
Give me the prophecy , or you get the same as her … 
" Like you won't kill us all anyway , the moment I hand it over ! " said Harry . 
" Whaddever you do , Harry , " said Neville fiercely from under the desk , lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin , " don'd gib it to him ! " 
Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder - the baby - headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway , his head bawling , his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him . 
Harry seized his chance : 
" PETRIFICUS TOTALUS ! " 
The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade , both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch . 
" Hermione , " Harry said at once , shaking her as the baby - headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again . 
" Whad did he do to her ? " said Neville , crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side , blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose . 
" I dunno … " 
Neville groped for Hermione's wrist . 
" She's alive ? " 
" Yeah , I dink so . " 
There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps , but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby - headed Death Eater in the next room . 
" Neville , we ' re not far from the exit , " Harry whispered , " we ' re right next to that circular room … if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come , I ' ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift … then you could find someone … raise the alarm … " 
" And whad are you going do do ? " said Neville , mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry . 
" I ' ve got to find the others , " said Harry . 
" Well , I ' b going do find dem wid you , " said Neville firmly . 
" But Hermione — " 
He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms , glaring at Harry , who hesitated , then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders . 
" Wait , " said Harry , snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville's hand , " you'd better take this . " 
Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door . 
" My gran's going do kill be , " said Neville thickly , blood spattering from his nose as he spoke , " dat was by dad's old wand . " 
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously . 
The baby - headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things , toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks , bawling and confused , while the glass - fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time - Turners continued to fall , shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them . 
They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway , which now seemed completely deserted . 
They walked a few steps forwards , Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight ; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more . 
With a sinking heart , Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors . 
But before they could make a decision as to which way to try , a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it . 
" Ron ! " croaked Harry , dashing towards them . 
" Ginny - are you all - ? " 
" Harry , " said Ron , giggling weakly , lurching forwards , seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes , " there you are … ha ha ha … you look funny , Harry … you ' re all messed up … " 
Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth . 
Next moment his knees had given way , but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes , so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow . 
" Ginny ? " 
Harry said fearfully . 
" What happened ? " 
But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position , panting and holding her ankle . 
" I think her ankle's broken , I heard something crack , " whispered Luna , who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt . 
" Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets ; it was a very odd place , some of the time we were just floating in the dark - " 
" Harry , we saw Uranus up close ! " said Ron , still giggling feebly . 
" Get it , Harry ? 
We saw Uranus - ha ha ha - " 
A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst . 
" - anyway , one of them grabbed Ginny's foot , I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face , but … " 
Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny , who was breathing in a very shallow way , her eyes still closed . 
" And what about Ron ? " said Harry fearfully , as Ron continued to giggle , still hanging off the front of Harry's robes . 
" I don't know what they hit him with , " said Luna sadly , " but he's gone a bit funny , I could hardly get him along at all . " 
" Harry , " said Ron , pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly , " you know who this girl is , Harry ? 
She's Loony … Loony Lovegood … ha ha ha " 
" Luna , can you help Ginny ? " 
" Yes , " said Luna , sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping , then putting an arm around Ginnys waist and pulling her up . 
" It's only my ankle , I can do it myself ! " said Ginny impatiently , but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support . 
Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as , so many months ago , he had pulled Dudley's . 
He looked around : they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time - 
He heaved Ron towards a door ; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in , led by Bellatrix Lestrange . 
Stunning Spells shot across the room : Harry smashed his way through the door ahead , flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione : they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix . 
" Colloportus ! " shouted Harry , and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side . 
Harry span around ; they were back in the Brain Room and , sure enough , there were doors all around the walls . 
He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first . 
" Luna - Neville - help me ! " 
The three of them tore around the room , sealing the doors as they went ; Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door : 
There were footsteps running along behind the doors , every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one , so it creaked and shuddered ; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall - then , as Harry reached the very top of the room , he heard Luna cry : 
He turned in time to see her flying through the air ; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time ; Luna hit a desk , slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled , as still as Hermione . 
" Get Potter ! " shrieked Bellatrix , and she ran at him ; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room ; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy - 
" Hey ! " said Ron , who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry , giggling . 
" Hey Harry , there are brains in here , ha h a ha , isn't that weird , Harry ? " 
But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank . 
Harry , Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish : for a moment it seemed suspended in midair , then it soared towards Ron , spinning as it came , and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it , unraveling like rolls of film - 
" Ha ha ha , Harry , look at it - " said Ron , watching it disgorge its gaudy innards , " Harry come and touch it ; bet it's weird - " 
" RON , NO ! " 
Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain , but he was sure it would not be anything good . 
The moment they made contact with his skin , the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes . 
" Harry , look what's happen — No - no - I don't like it - no , stop - stop - " 
But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now ; he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body . 
" Diffindo ! " yelled Harry , trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes , but they would not break . 
" Harry , it ' ll suffocate him ! " screamed Ginny , immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor – then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face . 
" STUBEFY ! " shouted Neville , wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters , " STUBEFY , STUBEFY ! " 
But nothing happened . 
Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters , two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them . 
Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him : holding the prophecy high above his head , he sprinted back up the room ; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others . 
It seemed to have worked ; they streaked after him , knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy , and he dashed through the only door still open , the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come ; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him . 
He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish - 
The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters ' laughter : he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him , while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him . 
Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him : the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand , his wand clutched tightly in his right . 
The back of his legs hit something solid : he had reached the dais where the archway stood . 
" Potter , your race is run , " drawled Lucius Malfoy , pulling off his mask , " now hand me the prophecy like a good boy . " 
" Let - let the others go , and I ' ll give it to you ! " said Harry desperately . 
A few of the Death Eaters laughed . 
" You are not in a position to bargain , Potter , " said Lucius Malfoy , his pale face flushed with pleasure . 
Harry's heart sank : Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them , Hermiones wand held fast in his trembling hand . 
" Neville - no - go back to Ron - " 
" STUBEFY ! " Neville shouted again , pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn . 
" STUBEFY ! 
One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind , pinioning his arms to his sides . 
He struggled and kicked ; several of the Death Eaters laughed . 
" Well , your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause … your death will not come as a great shock . " 
" Longbottom ? " repeated Bellatrix , and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face . 
" No , no , no , " said Bellatrix . 
" No , let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents … unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy . " 
Bellatrix raised her wand . 
Neville screamed , his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground . 
The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor , twitching and screaming in agony . 
" That was just a taster ! " said Bellatrix , raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet . 
She turned and gazed up at Harry . 
Harry did not have to think ; there was no choice . 
Malfoy jumped forwards to take it . 
Then , high above them , two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room : Sirius , Lupin , Moody , Tonks and Kingsley . 
Malfoy turned , and raised his wand , but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him . 
Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact , but dived off the dais out of the way . 
The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order , who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor . 
Through the darting bodies , the flashes of light , Harry could see Neville crawling along . 
He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville . 
" Yes , " said Neville , trying to pull himself up . 
" I dink he's all righd - he was still fighding de brain when I lefd - " 
The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it , leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been only seconds before ; both scrambled away from the spot , then a thick arm came out of nowhere , seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright , so that his toes were barely touching the floor . 
" Give it to me , " growled a voice in his ear , " give me the prophecy - " 
Through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away ; Kingsley was fighting two at once ; Tonks , still halfway up the tiered seats , was firing spells down at Bellatrix - nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying . 
He turned his wand backwards towards the man's side , but had no breath to utter an incantation , and the man's free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy - 
" AARGH ! " 
Neville had come lunging out of nowhere ; unable to articulate a spell , he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eaters mask . 
" STUPEFY ! " 
The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off : it was Macnair , Buckbeak's would - be killer , one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot . 
" Thanks ! " Harry said to Neville , pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past , dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs ; then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped . 
For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy , but then he saw Moody's magical eye spinning away across the floor . 
Its owner was lying on his side , bleeding from the head , and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville : Dolohov , his long pale face twisted with glee . 
" Tarantallegra ! " he shouted , his wand pointing at Neville , whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap - dance , unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again . 
" Now , Potter - " 
Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife ; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville's jerking legs , but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell . 
Dolohov raised his wand again . 
" Accio proph — " 
The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling on to it . 
Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling , their wands flashing like swords , sparks flying from their wand - tips - 
Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione . 
Springing up , Harry yelled , " Petrificus Totalus ! " Once again , Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards , landing with a crash on his back . 
" Now I want you to get out of - " 
Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps , her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix , triumphant , running back towards the fray . 
" Harry , take the prophecy , grab Neville and run ! " Sirius yelled , dashing to meet Bellatrix . 
Harry did not see what happened next : Kingsley swayed across his field of vision , battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood ; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself towards Neville - 
" Can you stand ? " he bellowed in Neville's ear , as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably . 
Neville did so - Harry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction , they would not support him , and then , out of nowhere , a man lunged at them : both fell backwards , Neville's legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle's , Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed . 
" The prophecy , give me the prophecy , Potter ! " snarled Lucius Malfoy's voice in his ear , and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs . 
" No - get - off - me … Neville - catch it ! " 
Harry flung the prophecy across the floor , Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest . 
Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville , but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled , " Impedimenta ! " 
As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling . 
Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again , but before he could draw breath to strike , Lupin had jumped between them . 
" Harry , round up the others and GO ! " 
Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps ; Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight ; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step - 
A spell hit the stone bench at Harrys heel ; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below . 
Neville sank to the ground , his legs still jerking and thrashing , and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket . 
" Come on ! " said Harry desperately , hauling at Neville's robes . 
He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam - the small spun - glass ball dropped from his pocket and , before either of them could catch it , one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it : it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them . 
As both of them stared at the place where it had broken , appalled at what had happened , a pearly - white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air , unnoticed by any but them . 
Harry could see its mouth moving , but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them , not one word of the prophecy could he hear . 
" Harry , I ' b sorry ! " cried Neville , his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder . 
" I ' b so sorry , Harry , I didn'd bean do - " 
Harry shouted . 
" Just try and stand , let's get out of - " 
" Dubbledore ! " said Neville , his sweaty face suddenly transported , staring over Harry's shoulder . 
" What ? " 
" DUBBLEDORE ! " 
Harry turned to look where Neville was staring . 
Directly above them , framed in the doorway from the Brain Room , stood Albus Dumbledore , his wand aloft , his face white and furious . 
Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body - they were saved . 
Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry , who had no more thoughts of leaving . 
Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there and yelled to the others . 
One of the Death Eaters ran for it , scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite . 
Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line - 
Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light : he was laughing at her . 
" Come on , you can do better than that ! " he yelled , his voice echoing around the cavernous room . 
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest . 
The laughter had not quite died from his face , but his eyes widened in shock . 
Harry released Neville , though he was unaware of doing so . 
He was jumping down the steps again , pulling out his wand , as Dumbledore , too , turned towards the dais . 
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall : his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch . 
Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted , once - handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil , which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind , then fell back into place . 
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream , but knew it meant nothing - Sirius had only just fallen through the archway , he would reappear from the other side any second … 
But Sirius did not reappear . 
" SIRIUS ! " Harry yelled . 
" SIRIUS ! " 
Sirius must be just behind the curtain , he , Harry , would pull him back out … 
But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais , Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest , holding him back . 
" There's nothing you can do , Harry - " 
" Get him , save him , he's only just gone through ! " 
" - it's too late , Harry . " 
" There's nothing you can do , Harry … nothing … he's gone . " 
Harry yelled . 
He did not believe it ; he would not believe it ; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had . 
Lupin did not understand ; people hid behind that curtain ; Harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room . 
" SIRIUS ! " he bellowed . 
" SIRIUS ! " 
" He can't come back , Harry , " said Lupin , his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry . 
" He can't come back , because he's d - " 
" SIRIUS ! " 
To Harry it was meaningless noise , the deflected curses flying past them did not matter , nothing mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius - who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain - was not going to emerge at any moment , shaking back his dark hair and eager to re - enter the battle . 
Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais . 
Harry , still staring at the archway , was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting 
But some part of him realized , even as he fought to break free from Lupin , that Sirius had never kept him waiting before … Sirius had risked everything , always , to see Harry , to help him … if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it , the only possible explanation was that he could not come back … that he really was . 
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room , seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes ; Mad - Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay , and was attempting to revive her ; behind the dais there were still hashes of light , grunts and cries - Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius's duel with Bellatrix . 
" Harry ? " 
Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood . 
" Harry … I ' b really sorry … " said Neville . 
Harry nodded . 
" Here , " said Lupin quietly , and pointing his wand at Neville's legs he said , " Finite . " 
The spell was lifted : Neville's legs fell back to the floor and remained still . 
Lupin's face was pale . 
Where are they all , Neville ? " 
Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke . 
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais . 
Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain : Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around . 
He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it ; she was halfway up the steps now 
" SHE KILLED SIRIUS ! " bellowed Harry . 
The hem of Bellatrix's robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming … 
She aimed a curse over her shoulder . 
Harry was deluged in the foul - smelling potion within : the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long colored tentacles , but he shouted , " Wingardium Leviosa ! " and they flew off him up into the air . 
Slipping and sliding , he ran on towards the door ; he leapt over Luna , who was groaning on the floor , past Ginny , who said , " Harry - what - ? " , past Ron , who giggled feebly , and Hermione , who was still unconscious . 
He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room ; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts . 
He ran , but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating . 
Once more , he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra . 
" Where's the exit ? " he shouted desperately , as the wall rumbled to a halt again . 
" Where's the way out ? " 
The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask . 
The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him , torch - lit and empty . 
He ran … 
He could hear a lift clattering ahead ; he sprinted up the passageway , swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift . 
He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around . 
Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall , but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him . 
He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren : the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells . 
She had stopped running . 
" Come out , come out , little Harry ! " she called in her mock baby voice , which echoed off the polished wooden floors . 
" What did you come after me for , then ? 
I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin ! " 
" I am ! " shouted Harry , and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am ! 
I am ! 
I am ! all around the room 
" Aaaaaah … did you love him , little baby Potter ? " 
Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before ; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed , " Crucio ! " 
Bellatrix screamed : the spell had knocked her off her feet , but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had - she was already back on her feet , breathless , no longer laughing . 
Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again . 
Her counter - spell hit the head of the handsome wizard , which was blown off and landed twenty feet away , gouging long scratches into the wooden floor . 
" You need to mean them , Potter ! 
You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I ' ll show you how it is done , shall I ? I ' ll give you a lesson - " 
Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed , " Crucio ! " and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur's arm , holding its bow , span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard's head . 
" Potter , you cannot win against me ! " she cried . 
He could hear her moving to the right , trying to get a clear shot of him . 
He backed around the statue away from her , crouching behind the centaur's legs , his head level with the house - elf's . 
" I was and am the Dark Lord's most loyal servant . 
I learned the Dark Arts from him , and I know spells of such power that you , pathetic little boy , can never hope to compete " 
" Stupefy ! " yelled Harry . 
He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain . 
She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck . 
" Protego ! " 
Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin's ears went flying across the room . 
" Potter , I'm going to give you one chance ! " 
" Give me the prophecy - roll it out towards me now - and I may spare your life ! " 
" Well , you ' re going to have to kill me , because it's gone ! " 
Harry roared and , as he shouted it , pain seared across his forehead ; his scar was on fire again , and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage . 
" And he knows ! ' " said Harry , with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix's own . 
He's not going to be happy with you , is he ? " 
" What ? 
What do you mean ? " she cried , and for the first time there was fear in her voice . 
" The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps ! 
What do you think Voldemort ' ll say about that , then ? " 
" LIAR ! " she shrieked , but he could hear the terror behind the anger now . 
" YOU ' VE GOT IT , POTTER , AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME ! Accio prophecy ! 
ACCIO PROPHECY ! " 
Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her , the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst . 
He waved his empty hand from behind the one - eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him . 
It smashed and nobody heard what it said , tell your boss that ! " 
" Don't waste your breath ! " yelled Harry , his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar , now more terrible than ever . 
" He can't hear you from here ! " 
" Can't I , Potter ? " said a high , cold voice . 
Harry opened his eyes . 
Tall , thin and black - hooded , his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt , his scarlet , slit - pupilled eyes staring … Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall , his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen , quite unable to move . 
" So , you smashed my prophecy ? " said Voldemort softly , staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes . 
" No , Bella , he is not lying … I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind … months of preparation , months of effort … and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again " " Master , I am sorry I knew not , I was fighting the Animagus Black ! " sobbed Bellatrix , flinging herself down at Voldemort's feet as he paced slowly nearer . 
Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies ? " 
" But Master - he is here - he is below " 
" I have nothing more to say to you , Potter , " he said quietly . 
" You have irked me too often , for too long . 
AVADA KEDAVRA ! " 
Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist ; his mind was blank , his wand pointing uselessly at the floor . 
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive , leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort . 
The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry . 
" What - ? " cried Voldemort , staring around . 
And then he breathed , " Dumbledore ! " 
Harry looked behind him , his heart pounding . 
Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates . 
Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore , who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak . 
Next second , he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain . 
The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix , who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest , before it dived at her , pinning her to the floor . 
Meanwhile , the goblin and the house - elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one - armed centaur galloped at Voldemort , who vanished and reappeared beside the pool . 
The headless statue thrust Harry backwards , away from the fight , as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both . 
" It was foolish to come here tonight , Tom , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed , instead hitting the security guard's desk , which burst into flame . 
Dumbledore flicked his own wand : the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry , though shielded by his golden guard , felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it . 
" You do not seek to kill me , Dumbledore ? " called Voldemort , his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield . 
" We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man , Tom , " Dumbledore said calmly , continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world , as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall . 
" There is nothing worse than death , Dumbledore ! " snarled Voldemort . 
" You are quite wrong , " said Dumbledore , still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks . 
Harry felt scared to see him walking along , undefended , shieldless ; he wanted to cry out a warning , but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall , blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it . 
" Indeed , your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness " 
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield . 
This time it was the one - armed centaur , galloping in front of Dumbledore , that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces , but before the fragments had even hit the floor , Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip . 
A long thin flame flew from the tip ; it wrapped itself around Voldemort , shield and all . 
For a moment , it seemed Dumbledore had won , but then the fiery rope became a serpent , which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned , hissing furiously , to face Dumbledore . 
Voldemort vanished ; the snake reared from the floor , ready to strike . 
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared , standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood . 
" Look out ! " Harry yelled . 
But even as he shouted , another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake had struck . 
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore , opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole : he burst into flame and fell to the floor , small , wrinkled and flightless . 
At the same moment , Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long , fluid movement - the snake , which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him , flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke ; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass . 
Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool , slopping wildly over the sides , drenching the polished floor . 
Sure it was over , sure Voldemort had decided to flee , Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard , but Dumbledore bellowed : " Stay where you are , Harry ! " 
Harry could not see why : the hall was quite empty but for themselves , the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue , and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor 
And then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead : it was pain beyond imagining , pain past endurance . 
He was gone from the hall , he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes , so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature's began : they were fused together , bound by pain , and there was no escape 
And when the creature spoke , it used Harry's mouth , so that in his agony he felt his jaw move 
" If death is nothing , Dumbledore , kill the boy … " 
Let the pain stop , thought Harry … let him kill us … end it , Dumbledore … death is nothing compared to this … 
And I ' ll see Sirius again … 
And as Harry's heart filled with emotion , the creature's coils loosened , the pain was gone ; Harry was lying face down on the floor , his glasses gone , shivering as though he lay upon ice , not wood … 
And there were voices echoing through the hall , more voices than there should have been … Harry opened his eyes , saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him , but which now lay flat on its back , cracked and immobile . 
He put them on and raised his head a little to find Dumbledore's crooked nose inches from his own . 
" Are you all right , Harry ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry , shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly . 
The Atrium was full of people ; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall ; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them . 
As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet , Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house - elf and the goblin , leading a stunned - looking Cornelius Fudge forward . 
" He was there ! " shouted a scarlet - robed man with a ponytail , who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall , where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before . 
" I saw him , Mr . Fudge , I swear it was You - Know - Who , he grabbed a woman and Disapparated ! " 
" I know , Williamson , I know , I saw him too ! " gibbered Fudge , who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles . 
" If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore - apparently satisfied that Harry was all right , and walking forwards so that the newcomers realized he was there for the first time ( a few of them raised their wands ; others simply looked amazed ; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipperclad feet left the floor ) - " you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber , bound by an Anti - Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them . " 
" You - here - I - I " 
He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry , " Seize him ! " 
" Cornelius , I am ready to fight your men - and win , again ! " said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice . 
" But a few minutes ago you saw proof , with your own eyes , that I have been telling you the truth for a year . 
Lord Voldemort has returned , you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months , and it is time - you listened to sense ! " 
" I - don't – well " blustered Fudge , looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do . 
When nobody did , he said , " Very well - Dawlish ! Williamson ! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see … Dumbledore , you - you will need to tell me exactly - the Fountain of Magical Brethren - what happened ? " he added in a kind of whimper , staring around at the floor , where the remains of the statues of the witch , wizard and centaur now lay scattered . 
" We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts , " said Dumbledore . 
" Harry - Harry Potter ? " 
Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry , who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel . 
" He - here ? " said Fudge , goggling at Harry . 
" I shall explain everything , " repeated Dumbledore , " when Harry is back at school . " 
He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard's head lay on the floor . 
He pointed his wand at it and muttered , " Portus . " 
The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds , then became still once more . 
" Now see here , Dumbledore ! " said Fudge , as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it . 
You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic , you – you " 
His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half - moon spectacles . 
" You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts , " said Dumbledore . " You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work . 
I will give you … " Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed it … " half an hour of my time tonight , in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here . 
After that , I shall need to return to my school . 
If you need more help from me you are , of course , more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts . 
Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me . " 
Fudge goggled worse than ever ; his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair . 
" I - you " 
Dumbledore turned his back on him . 
" Take this Portkey , Harry . " 
He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand on it , past caring what he did next or where he went . 
" I shall see you in half an hour , " said Dumbledore quietly " One … two … three … " 
Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel . 
The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet ; the Atrium , Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of color and sound … 
Harry's feet hit solid ground ; his knees buckled a little and the golden wizard's head fell with a resounding dunk to the floor . 
He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledore's office . 
The delicate silver instruments stood once more on the spindle - legged tables , puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames , heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture . 
Harry looked through the window . 
The silence and the stillness , broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait , was unbearable to him . 
He walked around the quiet , beautiful office , breathing quickly , trying not to think . 
It was his fault Sirius had died ; it was all his fault . 
If he , Harry , had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort's trick , if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real , if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was , as Hermione had said , banking on Harry's love of playing the hero … 
It was unbearable , he would not think about it , he could not stand it … there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine , a dark hole where Sirius had been , where Sirius had vanished ; he did not want to have to be alone with that great , silent space , he could not stand it - 
Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn , stretching his arms as he surveyed Harry out of shrewd , narrow eyes . 
" And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning ? " said Phineas eventually " This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful Headmaster . 
Or has Dumbledore sent you here ? 
Harry could not speak . 
Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead , but Harry could not tell him . 
To say it aloud would be to make it final , absolute , irretrievable . 
Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob . 
" I hope this means , " said the corpulent , red - nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind the Headmaster's desk , " that Dumbledore will soon be back among us ? " 
Harry turned . 
The wizard was surveying him with great interest . 
Harry nodded . 
He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back , but it remained immovable . 
" Oh good , " said the wizard . 
He settled himself on the throne - like chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry 
" Dumbledore thinks very highly of you , as I am sure you know , " he said comfortably . 
" Oh yes . 
Harry could not stand this , he could not stand being himself any more … he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body , never wished so intensely that he could be somebody ; anybody , else … 
The empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame , making Harry leap away from the door , staring at the man spinning inside the grate . 
As Dumbledore's tall form unfolded itself from the fire , the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake , many of them giving cries of welcome . 
" Thank you , " said Dumbledore softly . 
He did not look at Harry at first , but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew , from an inside pocket of his robes , the tiny , ugly , featherless Fawkes , whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full - grown Fawkes usually stood . 
" Well , Harry , " said Dumbledore , finally turning away from the baby bird , " you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night's events . " 
Harry tried to say , " Good , " but no sound came out . 
It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused , and although Dumbledore was for once looking at him directly , and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory , Harry could not bear to meet his eyes . 
" Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up , " said Dumbledore . " Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St . Mungo's , but it seems she will make a full recovery . " 
Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet , which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler . 
He was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word 
" I know how you ' re feeling , Harry , " said Dumbledore very quietly . 
" You see , Dumbledore ? " said Phineas Nigellus slyly " Never try to understand the students . 
They would much rather be tragically misunderstood , wallow in self - pity , stew in their own - " 
" That's enough , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . 
Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window . 
He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance . 
Sirius had appeared there once , disguised as the shaggy black dog , so he could watch Harry play … he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been … Harry had never asked him … 
" There is no shame in what you are feeling , Harry , " said Dumbledore's voice . 
Harry felt the white - hot anger lick his insides , blazing in the terrible emptiness , filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words . 
" My greatest strength , is it ? " said Harry , his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium , no longer seeing it . 
" What don't I know ? " asked Dumbledore calmly . 
Harry turned around , shaking with rage . 
" I don't want to talk about how I feel , all right ? " 
This pain is part of being human " 
" THEN - I - DON ' T - WANT - TO - BE - HUMAN ! " Harry roared , and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindlelegged table beside him and flung it across the room ; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall . 
Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright , and the portrait of Armando Dippet said , " Really ! " 
" I ' VE HAD ENOUGH , I ' VE SEEN ENOUGH , I WANT OUT , I WANT IT TO END , I DON ' T CARE ANY MORE " 
He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that , too . 
It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions . 
" You do care , " said Dumbledore . 
" I - DON ' T ! " Harry screamed , so loudly that he felt his throat might tear , and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him , too ; shatter that calm old face , shake him , hurt him , make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself . 
" Oh , yes , you do , " said Dumbledore , still more calmly . 
" You have now lost your mother , your father , and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known . 
Of course you care . " 
But words were no longer enough , smashing things was no more help ; he wanted to run , he wanted to keep running and never look back , he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him , that hatefully calm old face . 
He turned on his heel and ran to the door , seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it . 
But the door would not open . 
Harry turned back to Dumbledore . 
" Let me out , " he said . 
He was shaking from head to foot . 
" No , " said Dumbledore , simply . 
For a few seconds they stared at each other . 
" Let me out , " Harry said again . 
" No , " Dumbledore repeated . 
" If you don't - if you keep me in here - if you don't let me " 
" I daresay I have too many . " 
He walked around his desk and sat down . 
behind it , watching Harry . 
" Not until I have had my say , " said Dumbledore . 
" Do you - do you think I want to - do you think I give a - I DON ' T CARE WHAT YOU ' VE GOT TO SAY ! " Harry roared . 
" I don't want to hear anything you ' ve got to say ! " 
" You will , " said Dumbledore steadily . 
" Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be . 
If you are to attack me , as I know you are close to doing , I would like to have thoroughly earned it . " 
" What are you talking - ? " 
Sirius was a brave , clever and energetic man , and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger . 
Nevertheless , you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight . 
If I had been open with you , Harry , as I should have been , you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries , and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight . 
And Sirius would not have had to come after you . 
That blame lies with me , and with me alone . " 
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it . 
" Please sit down , " said Dumbledore . 
It was not an order , it was a request . 
Harry hesitated , then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood , and took the seat facing Dumbledore's desk . 
" Am I to understand , " said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left , " that my great - greatgrandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead ? " 
" Yes , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . 
" I don't believe it , " said Phineas brusquely . 
Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place . 
" Harry , I owe you an explanation , " said Dumbledore . " An explanation of an old man's mistakes . 
For I see now that what I have done , and not done , with regard to you , bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age . 
But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young … and I seem to have forgotten , lately … " The sun was rising properly now ; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and bright . 
" I guessed , fifteen years ago , " said Dumbledore , " when I saw the scar on your forehead , what it might mean . 
I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort . " 
" You ' ve told me this before , Professor , " said Harry bluntly . 
He did not care about being rude . 
He did not care about anything very much any more . 
" Yes , " said Dumbledore apologetically . 
" Yes , but you see - it is necessary to start with your scar . 
For it became apparent , shortly after you rejoined the magical world , that I was correct , and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you , or else feeling powerful emotion . " 
" I know , " said Harry wearily . 
" And this ability of yours - to detect Voldemort's presence , even when he is disguised , and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused - has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers . " 
Harry did not bother to nod . 
He knew all of this already . 
Sure enough , there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence . 
I am speaking , of course , of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr . Weasley " 
" Yeah , Snape told me , " Harry muttered . 
" But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you ? 
Why I did not teach you Occlumency ? 
Why I had not so much as looked at you for months ? " 
Harry looked up . 
" Yeah , " Harry mumbled . 
" You see , " Dumbledore continued , " I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind , to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts , and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so . 
I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was - or had ever been - closer than that of headmaster and pupil , he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me . 
I feared the uses to which he would put you , the possibility that he might try and possess you . 
Harry , I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way . 
Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him , ready to strike , in those moments when he and Dumbledore had made eye - contact . 
He hoped , when he possessed you briefly a short while ago , that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him . 
So you see , I have been trying , in distancing myself from you , to protect you , Harry . 
He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago , but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius ; none of it mattered … 
" Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley's attack . 
In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort's assaults on your mind , I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape . " 
He paused . 
Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore's explanation ; he could hear the occasional rustle of robes , the slight clearing of a throat . 
Phineas Nigellus had still not returned … 
" Professor Snape discovered , " Dumbledore resumed , " that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months . 
Voldemort , of course , had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body ; and as he dwelled on the door , so did you , though you did not know what it meant . 
" And then you saw Rockwood , who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest , telling Voldemort what we had known all along - that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected . 
Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness : in this case , either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic , and risk revealing himself at last - or else you would have to take it for him . 
He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him : a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart . 
" I didn't practice , I didn't bother , I could ' ve stopped myself having those dreams , Hermione kept telling me to do it , if I had he'd never have been able to show me where to go , and - Sirius wouldn't - Sirius wouldn't " 
Something was erupting inside Harry's head : a need to justify himself , to explain - 
" I tried to check he'd really taken Sirius , I went to Umbridge's office , I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn't there , he said he'd gone ! " 
" Kreacher lied , " said Dumbledore calmly . 
Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic . " 
" Oh yes . 
Kreacher , I am afraid , has been serving more than one master for months . " 
" How ? " said Harry blankly . 
" He hasn't been out of Grimmauld Place for years . " 
" Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas , " said Dumbledore , " when Sirius , apparently , shouted at him to ' get out ' . 
He took Sirius at his word , and interpreted this as an order to leave the house . 
He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left … Black's cousin Narcissa , sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy " 
" How do you know all this ? " 
Harry said . 
His heart was beating very fast . 
He felt sick . 
He remembered worrying about Kreacher's odd absence over Christmas , remembered him turning up again in the attic … 
" Kreacher told me last night , " said Dumbledore . " You see , when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning , he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries . 
I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge's office . 
Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place . 
" When , however , you did not return from your trip into the Forest with Dolores Umbridge , Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort's . 
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued , " Alastor Moody , Nymphadora Tonks , Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he made contact . 
All agreed to go to your aid at once . 
In the meantime he , Professor Snape , intended to search the Forest for you . 
" But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you . 
He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened . 
And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry , it was the elf who told me - laughing fit to burst - where Sirius had gone . " 
" He was laughing ? " said Harry in a hollow voice . 
" Oh , yes , " said Dumbledore . " You see , Kreacher was not able to betray us totally . 
He is not Secret Keeper for the Order , he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts , or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal . 
He was bound by the enchantments of his kind , which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master , Sirius . 
But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort , yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it . " 
" Like what ? " said Harry . 
" Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you , " said Dumbledore quietly . 
" Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother . 
Voldemort knew already , of course , that Sirius was in the Order , and that you knew where he was - but Kreacher's information made him realize that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black . " 
Harry's lips were cold and numb . 
" So … when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night … " 
Then , if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not , Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not . 
Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday , and , at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire , Sirius was upstairs tending to him . " 
There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs ; his breathing was quick and shallow . 
" And Kreacher told you all this … and laughed ? " he croaked . 
" He did not wish to tell me , " said Dumbledore . " But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story , before I left for the Department of Mysteries . " 
" And , " whispered Harry , his hands curled in cold fists on his knees , " and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him " 
" She was quite right , Harry , " said Dumbledore . " I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect . 
I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us . 
I do not think Sinus took me very seriously , or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's " 
His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's . 
He was forced to do Sirius's bidding , because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved , but he felt no true loyalty to him . 
And whatever Kreacher's faults , it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier " 
" DON ' T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT ! " Harry yelled . 
He was on his feet again , furious , ready to fly at Dumbledore , who had plainly not understood Sirius at all , how brave he was , how much he had suffered … 
" What about Snape ? " 
Harry spat . 
" You ' re not talking about him , are you ? 
When I told him 
Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual – " 
" Harry , you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge , " said Dumbledore steadily , " but as I have explained , he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said . 
It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest . 
It was he , too , who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius's whereabouts . " 
Harry disregarded this ; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape , it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt , and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him . 
" Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - he made out Sirius was a coward " 
" Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him , " said Dumbledore . 
Harry snarled . 
" He threw me out of his office ! " 
" I am aware of it , " said Dumbledore heavily " I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself , though I was sure , at the time , that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence – " 
" Snape made it worse , my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him " Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on " - how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort , make it easier for him to get inside my – " 
" I trust Severus Snape , " said Dumbledore simply " But I forgot - another old man's mistake - that some wounds run too deep for the healing . 
I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father - I was wrong . " 
" But that's okay , is it ? " 
yelled Harry , ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls . 
" Sirius did not hate Kreacher , " said Dumbledore . " He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice . 
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike … the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie . 
We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long , and we are now reaping our reward . " 
" I did not say that , nor will you ever hear me say it , " Dumbledore replied quietly . 
" Sirius was not a cruel man , he was kind to house - elves in general . 
" Yeah , he did hate it ! " said Harry , his voice cracking , turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away . 
The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked , without realizing what he was doing , without seeing the office at all . 
" I was trying to keep Sirius alive , " said Dumbledore quietly 
" You did it to me all last summer " 
Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his longfingered hands . 
Harry watched him , but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion , or sadness , or whatever it was from Dumbledore , did not soften him . 
On the contrary , he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness . 
Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half - moon glasses . 
" It is time , " he said , " for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago , Harry . 
I am going to tell you everything . 
I ask only a little patience . 
You will have your chance to rage at me - to do whatever you like - when I have finished . 
I will not stop you . " 
Harry glared at him for a moment , then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited . 
Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window , then looked back at Harry and said , " Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts , Harry , safe and whole , as I had planned and intended . 
I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep . 
I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years . " 
He paused . 
Harry said nothing . 
" You might ask - and with good reason - why it had to be so . 
" My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive . 
Voldemort had been vanquished hours before , but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large , angry , desperate and violent . 
Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever ? 
I knew not whether it would be ten , twenty or fifty years before he returned , but I was sure he would do so , and I was sure , too , knowing him as I have done , that he would not rest until he killed you . 
I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power . 
And so I made my decision . 
You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows , which he despises , and which he has always , therefore , underestimated - to his cost . 
I am speaking , of course , of the fact that your mother died to save you . 
She gave you a lingering protection he never expected , a protection that flows in your veins to this day . 
I put my trust , therefore , in your mother's blood . 
I delivered you to her sister , her only remaining relative . " 
" She doesn't love me , " said Harry at once . 
" She may have taken you grudgingly , furiously , unwillingly , bitterly , yet still she took you , and in doing so , she sealed the charm I placed upon you . 
Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you . " 
" I still don't . " 
" While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells , there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort . 
He shed her blood , but it lives on in you and her sister . 
Her blood became your refuge . 
You need return there only once a year , but as long as you can still call it home , while you are there he cannot hurt you . 
Your aunt knows this . 
I explained what I had done in the letter I left , with you , on her doorstep . 
" Wait , " said Harry . 
" Wait a moment . " 
He sat up straighter in his chair , staring at Dumbledore . 
You told her to remember - it was your voice – " 
" I thought , " said Dumbledore , inclining his head slightly , " that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you . 
I suspected the Dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son . " 
" It did , " said Harry quietly . 
He wanted to chuck me out , but after the Howler came she - she said I had to stay " 
He stared at the floor for a moment , then said , " But what's this got to do with – " 
He could not say Sirius's name . 
" Five years ago , then , " continued Dumbledore , as though he had not paused in his story , " you arrived at Hogwarts , neither as happy nor as well - nourished as I would have liked , perhaps , yet alive and healthy . 
You were not a pampered little prince , but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances . 
" And then … well , you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do . 
You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner - much sooner - than I 
You survived again . 
You did more . 
You delayed his return to full power and strength . 
You fought a man's fight . 
I was … prouder of you than I can say . 
And yet , knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed , I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it . 
I alone could prevent this , so I alone must be strong . 
" I don't understand what you ' re saying , " said Harry . 
" Don't you remember asking me , as you lay in the hospital wing , why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby ? " 
Harry nodded . 
" Ought I to have told you then ? " 
Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing , but his heart was racing again . 
" You do not see the flaw in the plan yet ? 
Well , as you know , I decided not to answer you . 
Eleven , I told myself , was much too young to know . 
I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven . 
The knowledge would be too much at such a young age . 
" I should have recognized the danger signs then . 
I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew , one day , I must give a terrible answer . 
I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day … YOU were too young , much too young . 
" And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts . 
And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced : once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams . 
You did not ask me again , however , why Voldemort had left that mark on you . 
We discussed your scar , oh yes … we came very , very close to the subject . 
Why did I not tell you everything ? 
" Well , it seemed to me that twelve was , after all , hardly better than eleven to receive such information . 
I allowed you to leave my presence , bloodstained , exhausted but exhilarated , and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought , perhaps , to have told you then , it was swiftly silenced . 
You were still so young , you see , and I could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph … 
" Do you see , Harry ? 
Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now ? 
I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen , that I had told myself I could avoid , that I must avoid . " 
" I don't – " " I cared about you too much , " said Dumbledore simply . 
" I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth , more for your peace of mind than my plan , more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed . 
In other words , I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act . 
I defy anyone who has watched you as I have - and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined - not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered . 
What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future , if in the here and now you were alive , and well , and happy ? 
I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands . 
I watched from afar as you struggled to repel Dementors , as you found Sirius , learned what he was and rescued him . 
Was I to tell you then , at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry ? 
But now , at the age of thirteen , my excuses were running out . 
Young you might be , but you had proved you were exceptional . 
" But you came out of the maze last year , having watched Cedric Diggory die , having escaped death so narrowly yourself … and I did not tell you , though I knew , now Voldemort had returned , I must do it soon . 
And now , tonight , I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long , because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this . 
Harry waited , but Dumbledore did not speak . 
" I still don't understand . " 
" Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth . 
He knew the prophecy had been made , though he did not know its full contents . 
He set out to kill you when you were still a baby , believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy . 
He discovered , to his cost , that he was mistaken , when the curse intended to kill you backfired . 
And so , since his return to his body , and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year , he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety . 
This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return : the knowledge of how to destroy you . " 
The sun had risen fully now : Dumbledore's office was bathed in it . 
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque , the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops , and behind him , the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes . 
" The prophecy's smashed , " Harry said blankly . 
" I was pulling Neville up those benches in the - the room where the archway was , and I ripped his robes and it fell … " 
" The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of 
But the prophecy was made to somebody , and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly " 
" Who heard it ? " 
asked Harry , though he thought he knew the answer already 
" I did , " said Dumbledore . " On a cold , wet night sixteen years ago , in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head inn . 
I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher , though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all . 
I was disappointed . 
It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself . 
I told her , courteously I hope , that I did not think she would be suitable for the post . 
I turned to leave . " 
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch . 
He bent down , slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin , carved with runes around the edges , in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape . 
Dumbledore walked back to the desk , placed the Pensieve upon it , and raised his wand to his own temple . 
From it , he withdrew silvery , gossamer - fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin . 
He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment . 
A figure rose out of it , draped in shawls , her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses , and she revolved slowly ; her feet in the basin . 
But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke , it was not in her usual ethereal , mystic voice , but in the harsh , hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before : 
" The one with the power to vanquish the - Dark Lord approaches … born to those who have thrice defied him , born as the seventh month dies … and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal , but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not … and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives … the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies … " 
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished . 
Harry said very quietly , for Dumbledore , still staring at the Pensieve , seemed completely lost in thought . 
" It … did that mean … what did that mean ? " 
" It meant , " said Dumbledore , " that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July , nearly sixteen years ago . 
This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times . " 
Harry felt as though something was closing in on him . 
Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses . 
Sibyll's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys , both born at the end of July that year , both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix , both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times . 
One , of course , was you . 
The other was Neville Longbottom . " 
" But then … but then , why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville's ? " 
" The official record was re - labeled after Voldemort's attack on you as a child , " said Dumbledore . " It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring . " 
" I am afraid , " said Dumbledore slowly , looking as though every word cost him a great effort , " that there is no doubt that it is you . " 
" But you said - Neville was born at the end of July , too - and his mum and dad – " 
" You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy , the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort … Voldemort himself would mark him as his equal . 
And so he did , Harry . 
He chose you , not Neville . 
He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse . " 
" But he might have chosen wrong ! " said Harry . 
" He might have marked the wrong person ! " 
" He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him , " said Dumbledore . " And notice this , Harry : he chose , not the pureblood ( which , according to his creed , is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing ) but the half - blood , like himself . 
He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you , and in marking you with that scar , he did not kill you , as he intended , but gave you powers , and a future , which have fitted you to escape him not once , but four times so far - something that neither your parents , nor Neville's parents , ever achieved . " 
" Why did he do it , then ? " said Harry , who felt numb and cold . 
" Why did he try and kill me as a baby ? 
He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then – " 
" That might , indeed , have been the more practical course , " said Dumbledore , " except that Voldemort's information about the prophecy was incomplete . 
As you and your friends found out to your cost , and I to mine that night , it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard . 
Of course , I had not dreamed , when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney , that I would hear anything worth overhearing . 
My - our - one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building . " 
" So he only heard - ? " 
" He heard only the beginning , the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort . 
Consequently , he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you , and marking you as his equal . 
So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you , that it might be wise to wait , to learn more . 
He did not know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not – " 
" There is a room in the Department of Mysteries , " interrupted Dumbledore , " that is kept locked at all times . 
It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death , than human intelligence , than the forces of nature . 
It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all . 
That power took you to save Sirius tonight . 
That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort , because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests . 
In the end , it mattered not that you could not close your mind . 
Harry closed his eyes . 
If he had not gone to save Sirius , Sirius would not have died … More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again , Harry asked , without caring much about the answer , " The end of the prophecy ... it was something about neither ... can live ... " 
" … while the other survives , " said Dumbledore . 
" So , " said Harry , dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him , " so does that mean that … that one of us has got to kill the other one … in the end ? " " Yes , " said Dumbledore . 
Somewhere far beyond the office walls , Harry could hear the sound of voices , students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast , perhaps . 
It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food , who laughed , who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever . 
Sirius seemed a million miles away already ; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil , he would have found Sirius looking back at him , greeting him , perhaps , with his laugh like a bark … 
" I feel I owe you another explanation , Harry , " said Dumbledore hesitantly . 
I must confess … that I rather thought … you had enough responsibility to be going on with . " 
Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore's face into his long silver beard . 
" In a brief statement on Friday night , Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that HeWho - Must - Not - Be - Named has returned to this country and is active once more . 
" ' It is with great regret that I must confirm that t he wizard styling himself Lord - well , you know who I mean - is alive and among us again ,'said Fudge , looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters . 
' It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the Dementors of Azkaban , who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry's employ . 
The Minister's statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community , which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was ' no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You - Know - Who is operating amongst us once more ' . 
" Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy , though it is believed that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named and a select band of followers ( known as Death Eaters ) gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening . 
" Albus Dumbledore , newly reinstated Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot , has so far been unavailable for comment . 
He has insisted over the past year that You - Know - Who is not dead , as was widely hoped and believed , but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power . 
" There you are , Harry , I knew they'd drag you into it somehow , " said Hermione , looking over the top of the paper at him . 
Harry was sitting on the end of Ron's bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sun day Prophet . 
Ginny , whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey , was curled up at the foot of Hermione's bed ; Neville , whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape , was in a chair between the two beds ; and Luna , who had dropped in to visit , clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler , was reading the magazine upside - down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying . 
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet , threw a few to Harry , Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth . 
There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain's tentacles had wrapped around him . 
According to Madam Pomfrey , thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else , though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr . Ubbly's Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement . 
" Yes , they ' re very complimentary about you now , Harry , " said Hermione , scanning down the article . 
" ' A lone voice of truth … perceived as unbalanced , yet never wavered in his story … forced to bear ridicule and slander … ' Hmmm , " she said , frowning , " I notice they don't mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the Prophet … " 
She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs . 
The curse Dolohov had used on her , though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud , had nevertheless caused , in Madam Pomfrey's words , ' quite enough damage to be going on with ' . 
" You - Know - Who's Last Attempt to Take Over , pages two to four , What the Ministry Should Have Told Us , page five , Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore , pages six to eight , Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter , page nine … Well , " said Hermione , folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside , " it's certainly given them lots to write about . 
And that interview with Harry isn't exclusive , it's the one that was in The Quibbler months ago … " 
" He got a very good price for it , too , so we ' re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer to see if we can catch a Crumple - Horned Snorkack . " 
Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment , then said , " That sounds lovely " 
Ginny caught Harry's eye and looked away quickly , grinning . 
" So , anyway , " said Hermione , sitting up a little straighter and wincing again , " what's going on in school ? " 
" Well , Flitwick's got rid of Fred and George's swamp , " said Ginny , " he did it in about three seconds . 
But he left a tiny patch under the window and he's roped it off " 
" Why ? " said Hermione , looking startled . 
" Oh , he just says it was a really good bit of magic , " said Ginny , shrugging . 
" I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George , " said Ron , through a mouthful of chocolate . 
Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked , " So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore's back ? " 
" Yes , " said Neville , " everything's settled right back to normal . " 
" Not at all , " said Ginny " He's really , really miserable , actually … " She lowered her voice to a whisper . 
" He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts … " 
All six of them looked around . 
Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them , gazing up at the ceiling . 
Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs ; how he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him - nobody knew , and Umbridge was certainly not telling . 
Since she had returned to the castle she had not , as far as any of them knew , uttered a single word . 
Nobody really knew what was wrong with her , either . 
Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it , but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed . 
" Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock , " whispered Hermione . 
" Yeah , she shows signs of life if you do this , " said Ron , and with his tongue he made soft clipclopping noises . 
Umbridge sat bolt upright , looking around wildly . 
" No , I must have been dreaming … " 
Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes . 
" He's got to , " said Harry , " the other centaurs won't take him back , will they ? " 
" It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach , " said Ginny 
" Mind you , the whole subject's useless if you ask me , Firenze isn't a lot better … " 
" How can you say that ? " Hermione demanded . 
" After we ' ve just found out that there are real prophecies ? " 
Harry's heart began to race . 
He had not told Ron , Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained . 
Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression . 
He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim , there was no other way … 
" It is a pity it broke , " said Hermione quietly , shaking her head . 
" Yeah , it is , " said Ron . " Still , at least You - Know - Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going ? " he added , looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up . 
" You know , he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are . " 
" Oh , all right then , " said Ron grumpily , looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond . 
" Say hello to him for us ! " called Hermione , as Harry proceeded down the ward . 
Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory . 
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday . 
Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds , enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework . 
Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor , peering out of windows as he went ; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake , accompanied by the giant squid . 
He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not ; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company . 
He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid , though , as he had not talked to him properly since he'd returned … 
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room . 
Harry stopped dead ; so did Malfoy and the others . 
The only sounds were the shouts , laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors . 
Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers - then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice , " You ' re dead , Potter . " 
Harry raised his eyebrows . 
" Funny " he said , " you'd think I'd have stopped walking around … " 
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him ; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale , pointed face contorted with rage . 
" You ' re going to pay , " said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper . 
" I'm going to make you pay for what you ' ve done to my father … " 
" Well , I'm terrified now , " said Harry sarcastically . 
" I s ' pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm - up act compared to you three - what's the matter ? " he added , for Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name . 
Not scared of him , are you ? " 
" You think you ' re such a big man , Potter , " said Malfoy , advancing now , Crabbe and Goyle flanking him . 
I ' ll have you . 
You can't land my father in prison " 
" I thought I just had , " said Harry . 
" The Dementors have left Azkaban , " said Malfoy quietly . 
" Yeah , I expect they will , " said Harry " Still , at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now " 
Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand , but Harry was too quick for him ; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes . 
" Potter ! " 
The voice rang across the Entrance Hall . 
Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy … whatever Dumbledore said , he would never forgive Snape … never … 
" What are you doing , Potter ? " said Snape , as coldly as ever , as he strode over to the four of them . 
" I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy , sir , " said Harry fiercely . 
Snape stared at him . 
Snape looked towards the giant hour - glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile . 
In that case , Potter , we will simply have to - " 
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle ; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other , but otherwise looked quite well . 
" Professor McGonagall ! " said Snape , striding forwards . 
" Yes , Professor Snape , " said Professor McGonagall , shrugging off her traveling cloak , " I'm quite as good as new . 
She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came , shuffling their large feet and looking awkward . 
" Here , " said Professor McGonagall , thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe's chest and her cloak into Goyle's ; " take these up to my office for me . " 
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase . 
" Right then , " said Professor McGonagall , looking up at the hourglasses on the wall . 
" Well , I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You - Know - Who ! 
What say you , Professor Snape ? " 
" What ? " snapped Snape , though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well . 
" So that's fifty each for Potter , the two Weasleys , Longbottom and Miss Granger , " said Professor McGonagall , and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor's hour - glass as she spoke . 
" Oh - and fifty for Miss Lovegood , I suppose , " she added , and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw's glass . 
" Well , Potter , Malfoy I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this , " Professor McGonagall continued briskly . 
Harry did not need telling twice - he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy . 
Students lying around on the grass sunbathing , talking , reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets , looked up at him as he passed ; some called out to him , or else waved , clearly eager to show that they , like the Prophet , had decided he was something of a hero . 
He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago , but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way . 
He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid's cabin door that he was out , but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome . 
" All righ ' , Harry ! " he said , beaming , when Harry approached the fence . 
Hagrid asked him , as they settled d own at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice . 
Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid's face that he was not referring to Harry's physical well - being . 
" I'm fine , " Harry said quickly , because he could no t bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid's mind . 
" Up in a cave , like Sirius did when he – " 
Hagrid broke off , cleared his throat gruffly , looked at Harry , and took a long draught of juice . 
" Anyway , back now , " he said feebly . 
" You - you look better , " said Harry , who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius . 
Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back , ter tell yeh the truth . 
He's a good lad , really … I ' ve bin thinkin ' abou ' tryin'ter find him a lady friend , actually … " 
Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once ; the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the Forest , possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp , was positively alarming , but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point . 
He was starting to wish he was alone again , and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice , half - emptying his glass . 
" Ev ' ryone knows yeh ' ve bin tellin'the truth now , Harry , " said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly . 
Harry shrugged . 
" Look … " Hagrid leaned towards him across the table , " I knew Sirius longer ' n yeh did … he died in battle , an'tha's the way he'd ' ve wanted ter go – " 
" He didn't want to go at all ! " said Harry angrily . 
Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head … 
" Nah , I don ' reckon he did , " he said quietly . 
" But s till , Harry … he was never one ter sit aroun ' at home an ' let other people do the fightin ' . 
Harry leapt up . 
" I ' ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing , " he said mechanically . 
Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open ; he was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye , and walking away across the lawn . 
He closed his eyes for a few moments , wishing they would all vanish , that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds … 
A few days ago , before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind , he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth , for them to believe that Voldemort was back , and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad . 
He walked a short way around the lake , sat down on its bank , sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs , and stared out over the gleaming water , thinking … 
An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world . 
It was just that he had never really understood what that meant … 
And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake , with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him , with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside , he could not muster any great sense of fear . 
It was sunny , and the grounds around him were full of laughing people , and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race , it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include , or end in , murder … 
He sat there for a long time , gazing out at the water , trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here , on the opposite bank , that Sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred Dementors … 
He got up and returned to the castle , wiping his face on his sleeve as he went . 
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term . 
Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius , but Ron tended to make ` hushing noises every time she mentioned his name . 
Harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet ; his wishes varied with his mood . 
He knew one thing , though : unhappy as he felt at the moment , he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days ' time when he was back at number four , Privet Drive . 
Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer , he did not feel any better about it . 
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term . 
It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime , evidently hoping to depart undetected , but unfortunately for her , she met Peeves on the way , who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed , and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk . 
Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half - heartedly to restrain them . 
Indeed , Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself , because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick . 
Their last evening at school arrived ; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end - of - term feast , but Harry had not even started . 
" Come on , I'm starving . " 
But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron , Harry made no effort to speed up his packing . 
The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast . 
He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech . 
Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and , as he did so , noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it . 
He bent down , pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it . 
He realized what it was within seconds . 
Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place . 
Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package . 
Out fell a small , square mirror . 
It looked old ; it was certainly dirty . 
Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him . 
He turned the mirror over . 
This is a two - way mirror , I ' ve got the other . 
If you need to speak to me , just say my name into it ; you ' ll appear in my mirror and I ' ll be able to talk in yours . 
James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions . 
Harry's heart began to race . 
He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago . 
He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again , right now , he knew it - 
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there ; the dormitory was quite empty . 
He looked back at the mirror , raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said , loudly and clearly , " Sirius . " 
His breath misted the surface of the glass . 
He held the mirror even closer , excitement flooding through him , but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own . 
He wiped the mirror clear again and said , so that every syllable rang clearly through the room : 
" Sirius Black ! " 
Nothing happened . 
Sirius didn't have his mirror on him when he went through the archway , said a small voice in Harry's head . 
Harry remained quite still for a moment , then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered . 
He had been convinced , for a whole , shining minute , that he was going to see Sirius , talk to him again … 
Disappointment was burning in his throat ; he got up and began throwing his things pell - mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror - 
But then an idea struck him … a better idea than a mirror … a much bigger , more important idea … how had he never thought of it before - why had he never asked ? 
He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing ; he hurtled across the empty common room , through the portrait hole and off along the corridor , ignoring the Fat Lady , who called after him : " The feast is about to start , you know , you ' re cutting it very fine ! " 
He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead . 
Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt , panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later , until after the end of the feast … 
But just as he had given up hope , he saw it - a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor . 
" Hey - hey Nick ! NICK ! " 
The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall , revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington . 
" Good evening , " he said , withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry " I am not the only one who is late , then ? 
Though , " he sighed , " in a rather different sense , of course … " 
" Nick , can I ask you something ? " 
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter , apparently to give himself thinking time . 
He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely . 
" Can't it wait until after the feast ? " 
" No - Nick - please , " said Harry , " I really need to talk to you . 
Can we go in here ? " 
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed . 
Harry was holding the door open for him , but he drifted through the wall instead . 
Harry asked , as he closed the door . 
" You to come and find me , " said Nick , now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds . 
Nick said nothing . 
But you ' re still here , aren't you ? " 
Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds . 
" You died , but I'm talking to you … you can walk around Hogwarts and everything , can't you ? " 
" Yes , " said Nearly Headless Nick quietly , " I walk and talk , yes . " 
" So , you came back , didn't you ? " said Harry urgently . 
As ghosts . 
They don't have to disappear completely . 
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated , then said , " Not everyone can come back as a ghost . " 
" What d ' you mean ? " said Harry quickly 
So he can come back , right ? " 
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry . 
" He won't come back . " 
" Sirius Black , " said Nick . 
" But you did ! " said Harry angrily . 
" You came back - you ' re dead and you didn't disappear - " 
" Why not ? " said Harry . 
" Anyway - it doesn't matter - Sirius won't care if it's unusual , he ' ll come back , I know he will ! " 
And so strong was his belief , Harry actually turned his head to check the door , sure , for a split second , that he was going to see Sirius , pearly - white and transparent but beaming , walking through it towards him . 
" He will not come back , " repeated Nick . 
" He will have … gone on . " 
" What d ' you mean , ' gone on ' ? " said Harry quickly " Gone on where ? 
Listen - what happens when you die , anyway ? 
Where do you go ? 
Why - ? " 
" I cannot answer , " said Nick . 
" Who can answer better than you ? " 
" I was afraid of death , " said Nick softly . 
I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have … well , that is neither here nor there … in fact , I am neither here nor there … " 
He gave a small sad chuckle . 
" I know nothing of the secrets of death , Harry , for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead . 
I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries - " 
" Don't talk to me about that place ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" I am sorry not to have been more help , " said Nick gently " Well … well , do excuse me … the feast , you know … " 
And he left the room , leaving Harry there alone , gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared . 
Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more . 
He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle , wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again . 
He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady's corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall . 
A second glance showed him it was Luna . 
There were no good hiding places nearby , she was bound to have heard his footsteps , and in any case , Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment . 
" Hello , " said Luna vaguely , glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice . 
" How come you ' re not at the feast ? " 
Harry asked . 
" People take them and hide them , you know . 
But as it's the last night , I really do need them back , so I ' ve been putting up signs . " 
She gestured towards the noticeboard , upon which , sure enough , she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes , with a plea for their return . 
An odd feeling rose in Harry ; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius's death . 
" I think they think I'm a bit odd , you know . 
Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully . 
" That's no reason for them to take your things , " he said flatly . 
" Oh , no , " she said , smiling at him . 
It was just that I wanted to pack tonight . 
Anyway … why aren't you at the feast ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
" Just didn't feel like it . " 
Harry nodded curtly , but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius . 
He had just remembered that she , too , could see Thestrals . 
" I mean , who … has anyone you known ever died ? " 
" Yes , " said Luna simply , " my mother . 
She was a quite extraordinary witch , you know , but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day . 
I was nine . " 
" I still feel very sad about it sometimes . 
But I ' ve still got Dad . 
And anyway , it's not as though I ' ll never see Mum again , is it ? " 
" Er - isn't it ? " said Harry uncertainly . 
She shook her head in disbelief . 
You heard them , just behind the veil , didn't you ? " 
" You mean … " 
" In that room with the archway . 
They were just lurking out of sight , that's all . 
You heard them . " 
They looked at each other . 
Harry did not know what to say , or to think ; Luna believed so many extraordinary things … yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil , too . 
" Are you sure you don't want me to help you look for your stuff ? " he said . 
" Oh , no , " said Luna . " No , I think I ' ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up … it always does in the end … well , have a nice holiday Harry " 
" Yeah … yeah , you too . " 
She walked away from him and , as he watched her go , he found that the terrible weight in his stomach - seemed to have lessened slightly . 
Firstly Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle , who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses , attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet . 
The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D . A . members , who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry's aid . 
By the time Ernie Macmillan , Hannah Abbott , Susan Bones , Justin Finch - Fletchley , Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them , Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry , Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze . 
" I must say , I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mother's face when he gets off the train , " said Ernie , with some satisfaction , as he watched Malfoy squirm above him . 
Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment , where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties . 
Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again , Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia , which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched . 
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet . 
It was now full of articles about how to repel Dementors , attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning … 
" Hey , Harry " said Ron softly , nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor . 
Harry looked around . 
Cho was passing , accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe , who was wearing a balaclava . 
His and Cho's eyes met for a moment . 
Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight . 
" Nothing , " said Harry truthfully . 
" I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now , " said Hermione tentatively . 
Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him ; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius ' , death felt that way these days … the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much , much longer ; it stretched across two universes , the one with Sirius in it , and the one without . 
Ron asked Hermione , but it was Ginny who answered . 
" Michael Corner , " she said . 
" Michael - but – " said Ron , craning around in hiss eat to stare at her . " But you were going out with him ! " 
" He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch , and got really sulky , so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead . " 
She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill , turned The Quibbler upside - down and began marking her answers . 
Ron looked highly delighted . 
" Well , I always thought he was a bit of an idiot , " he said , prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle . 
Just choose someone - better - next time . " 
" Well , I ' ve chosen Dean Thomas , would you say he's better ? " asked Ginny vaguely . 
" WHAT ? " shouted Ron , upending the chessboard : Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead . 
As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross , Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less . 
He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off , but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September , when it would take him back to Hogwarts . 
When the ticket inspector signaled to Harry , Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten , however , he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side : a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all . 
There was Mad - Eye Moody , looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it , his gnarled hands clutching a long staff , his body wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak . 
Tonks stood just behind him , her bright bubblegumpink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling , wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T - shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters . 
At the front of the group stood Mr . and Mrs . Weasley , dressed in their Muggle best , and Fred and George , who were both wearing brand - new jackets in some lurid green , scaly material . 
" Ron , Ginny ! " called Mrs . Weasley , hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly " Oh , and Harry dear - how are you ? " 
" Fine , " lied Harry , as she pulled him into a tight embrace . 
Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins ' new clothes . 
" What are they supposed to be ? " he asked , pointing at the jackets . 
" Hello , Harry " said Lupin , as Mrs . Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione . 
" Well , " said Lupin with a slight smile , " we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home . " 
" I dunno if that's a good idea , " said Harry at once . 
" Oh , I think it is , " growled Moody , who had limped a little closer . 
He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder ; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat . 
Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad - Eye was pointing and there , sure enough , were the three Dursleys , who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee . 
" Ah , Harry " said Mr . Weasley , turning from Hermione's parents , who he had just greeted enthusiastically , and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione . 
" Yeah , I reckon so , Arthur , " said Moody . 
He and Mr . Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys , who were apparently rooted to the floor . 
" Good afternoon , " said Mr . Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him . 
" You might remember me , my name's Arthur Weasley " 
As Mr . Weasley had single - handedly demolished most o f the Dursleys ' living room two years previously , Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him . 
Sure enough , Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr . Weasley , but chose not to say anything , partly , perhaps , because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one . 
Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed ; she kept glancing around , as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company . 
Dudley , meanwhile , seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant , a feat at which he was failing extravagantly . 
" We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry , " said Mr . Weasley , still smiling . 
" About how he's treated when he's at your place . " 
Uncle Vernon's moustache seemed to bristle with indignation . 
" I expect what you ' re not aware of would fill several books , Dursley , " growled Moody . 
" Anyway , that's not the point , " interjected Tonks , whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together , for she closed her eyes rather than look at her . " The point is , if we find out you ' ve been horrible to Harry – " 
" Yes , " said Mr . Weasley , " even if you won't let Harry use the fellytone – " 
" - Yeah , if we get any hint that Potter's been mistreated in any way , you ' ll have us to answer to , " said Moody . 
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously . 
His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs . 
" Are you threatening me , sir ? " he said , so loudly t hat passers - by actually turned to stare . 
" Yes , I am , " said Mad - Eye , who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly . 
" And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated ? " 
barked Uncle Vernon . 
" Well … " said Moody , pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye . 
He turned away from Uncle Vernon to survey Harry . 
If we don't hear from you for three days in a row , we ' ll send someone along … " 
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously . 
It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path . 
" Bye , then , Potter , " said Moody , grasping Harry's shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand . 
" Harry , we ' ll have you away from there as soon as we can , " Mrs . Weasley whispered , hugging him again . 
" We ' ll see you soon , mate , " said Ron anxiously , shaking Harry's hand . 
" Really soon , Harry " said Hermione earnestly . 
Harry nodded . 
He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him , to see them all ranged there , on his side .
