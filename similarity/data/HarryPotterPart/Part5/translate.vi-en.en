Chapter 20 : THE STORY OF HAGRID 
Harry ran all the way to the south room to find the invisibility cloak and map of the bandits in the chest ; It made it so fast that Ron and Ron were ready to go for at least five minutes to see Hermione return from the girl's bedroom after wrapping the towel , wearing gloves and carrying one of the capped caps . 
' It's cold outside ! ' she said as Ron pinched his tongue impatiently . 
They went through the hole and covered themselves in an invisibility cloak - Ron grew so fast he had to stoop so as not to open his legs from the shirt - then they moved slowly and very carefully , They went down the stairs , stopping at the stairs between the stairs to check on the map the signs of Filch or Norris . 
They are lucky ; They could not see anyone but Nick Whistler . Flying away their heads and calling out something that sounded like ' Weasley is our King ' . 
They sneaked past the Hall and went out into the air and the snow covered land . 
His heart jumped when Harry saw the bright squares of lights in front of him and the smoke rising from Hagrid's hut . 
It accelerates , the others pushing and hitting each other behind it . 
The thick snow is scorched by their feet until they reach the door of the wood . 
When Harry raised his hand and knocked on the door three times , the dog's voice began to rumble inward . 
' Hagrid , we're here ! ' Harry called through the keyhole . 
' How can we know ? " said a gruff voice . 
They laughed together under invisibility cloak ; Hagrid's voice told them that he was satisfied . ' Three seconds , Fang avoided , this lazy dog ' 
The bolt was pulled up , the door snapped open and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap . 
Cried Hermione . 
' Oh , my voice down ! " said Hagrid briskly , and stared at their heads all around . ' Hiding under the shirt , okay ? 
Come on home , come on ! ' 
' I'm sorry ! ' Hermione whispered as the three of them drove past Hagrid to get in and took off the invisibility cloak so he could see them . ' I just ... oh , Hagrid ! ' 
' No problem ' ! " Hagrid hastily said , closing the door behind them and hastily pulling on all the curtain , but Hermione continued to stare at her frantically . 
Hagrid's hair was bleeding , and his left eye fell into a line between a large bruise . 
There were many cuts on his face and hands , some still bleeding , and he walked away cautiously , seemingly breaking his ribs . 
Obviously , I have just arrived home ; a rugged travel mantle squeezed across the back of the chair and a bag large enough to squeeze some children against the wall opposite the door . 
Hagrid , twice the size of a normal man , was hobbling to the fireplace and placed a bronze kettle on it . 
' What happened to you ? ' Harry asked , as Fang played around with the three , trying to lick their faces . 
' I did not breathe , ' ' Hagrid said flatly . ' Drink tea ? ' 
' Do not say that again , ' said Ron , ' you are in a safe place ! ' 
' You said you were fine , ' said Hagrid , as he straightened up and laughed at all of them but could not help but grin . ' Oh , so nice to see you again - happy summer vacation ? ' 
' Uncle Hagrid , you have been attacked ! ' Said Ron . 
' The last time you said it was nothing ' ! " Hagrid said earnestly . 
' Can you say that it is not okay if one of us has a face that looks like a fleshy meat ? ' Ron interrupted . 
' You should go to Mrs. Pomfrey , Uncle Hagrid , ' said Hermione nervously , ' some cuts look terrible . ' 
' Can you handle it , type ' ? Uncle Hagrid said roughly . 
Uncle walked to the giant wooden table in the middle of the tent and tugged at the tablecloth that was covering something . 
Under the scarf is a piece of meat that is slightly green , still bloody and larger than a car tire on average . 
' Are not you going to eat that stuff , Hagrid ? " Said Ron , leaning forward to see more clearly . ' It looks poisonous . ' 
' It looks just like that , it's dragon meat , ' said Hagrid . ' And you do not get here to eat it . ' 
He picked up the meat and patted it on the left half of the face . 
The light blue blood flowed down the beard while she moaned contentedly . 
' I'm better than a boob . 
This helps you less aching , you know . ' 
' Are you going to tell us what happened to you ? ' Asked Harry . 
' You can not , Harry . 
Strange secret . 
It is better for you to lose your job than to speak . ' 
' Are the giants attacking you , Hagrid ? ' Asked Hermione . 
Hagrid's fingers slipped off the dragon's meat and it fell to his chest . 
' Giants ? Uncle Hagrid said , catching the meat before it fell to the waist and hatched it back to his face , ' who said something about the giants ? 
Who did you talk to ? 
Who told you that - who said you were there ... uh ? ' 
' We're just guessing , ' said Hermione , utterly repentant . 
' Oh , you guessed it ? " Uncle Hagrid said , looking at her incredibly prolificly with her eyes unobstructed . 
' That's obvious , ' said Ron . 
Harry nodded approvingly . 
Hagrid glanced at them , then obeyed , threw the meat on the table , strode to the warmth that had begun to ring . 
" You can not tell that kids like three of us can know more than they can , " he snarled , and poured boiling water into the three barrel - shaped cans . ' And I will also not praise you for that knowledge . 
He called it curious . 
Put on other people ' . ' 
But his beard was jerky . 
' Does that mean you've met the giants ? ' Said Harry and grinned as he sat down at the table . 
Uncle Hagrid put the tea down in front of them , sat down and picked up the meat again , hatched it back to his uncle . 
' Yes , yes , ' he grumbled , ' You have come there . ' 
' And did you find them ? " Hermione said in a secret voice . 
' Yes , to be honest , finding them is not that hard , ' said Hagrid . ' big beautiful people . ' 
' Where are they ? ' Said Ron . 
' On the mountains , ' said Hagrid , not very enthusiastic . 
' Why do not the Muggles ... ? ' 
' They have , ' murmured Hagrid . ' Only their deaths were attributed to mountain accidents , right ? ' 
Uncle fixes the piece of meat so that it can cover the entire purple . 
' Go on , Hagrid , tell us what you do there ! ' Said Ron . 
Tell us about the attack of the giants and Harry will tell how his uncle was attacked by the Dementors - 
He squeezed the cauldron and dropped the meat at the same time ; a pile of saliva , tea , and blood came out of the table when Uncle Hagrid coughed , slurred and the meat slid to the floor . 
' What are you going to say , being attacked by the Dementors ? Uncle Hagrid growled . 
' Do not you know ? Hermione asked , eyes wide . 
' I do not know what's gone down since you left . 
Uncle is doing secret task , I do not want the owl to follow the doctor everywhere - the cursed curses ! 
Nothing serious ? ' 
' Seriously , they came and attacked me and my cousin , and then the Ministry of Magic dismissed me from school - ' 
' What ? ' 
' and you have to go to court and everything else , but tell us about the giants first . ' 
' I was expelled ! ' 
' Tell us about your summer vacation and I ' ll tell you my story . ' 
Hagrid looked at him with wide eyes . 
Harry looked back , the innocent assertion clearly visible on his face . 
' Okay , ' said Hagrid , in a tone of surrender . 
Uncle bent down and snatched the dragon meat out of Fang's mouth . 
' Oh , Hagrid , do not do that , it's not very hygienic - ' Hermione started , but Hagrid hatched the meat back into his swollen eyes . 
He took another sip of tea for steam , then said , ' We left shortly after the semester ended - ' 
' Mrs. Maxime's with you , right ? " Hermione interrupted . 
' Right , ' said Uncle Hagrid , and a gentle expression appeared on the few inches of his face , which was not blocked by the beard or the meat . ' Yes , we two go . 
And you must say this , she is not afraid of anything , Mrs. Olympe . 
She knows very well , dresses politely , and knows what we are going to do , she wondered how she felt when she climbed over the rocks and slept in the caves , but she do not complain ' 
' Do you know where you come from ? ' Harry repeated . ' Do you know where these giants are ? ' 
' Well , Dumbledore knows , and he tells you , ' said Hagrid . 
' Are they hidden ? ' Asked Ron . ' Is it a secret , where are they ? ' 
" It's not very secret , " said Hagrid , shaking his shaggy head . ' It's just that most of the witches never wonder where they are , ' is far from here . 
But in that place they are hard to meet people , so we need to have Dumbledore's instructions . 
It takes about a month to get there - 
' One month ? " Said Ron , as if he had never spoken of such a long and long journey . ' But - but why do not you use a Port Lock or something like that ? ' 
There was a strange look in Hagrid's unobstructed eyes as he looked at Ron in full measure ; look almost pity . 
' We are being watched , Ron , ' said the gruff . 
What is your opinion ? ' 
' I do not understand , ' said Hagrid . 
The Ministry is eyeing Dumbledore and anyone they think is on the side , 
' We know that , ' said Harry quickly , anxious to hear the rest of Hagrid's story , ' we know he's watching Dumbledore - ' 
' So you can not use magic to get there ? ' Ron asked , looking dumbfounded , ' did you go the Muggles way ? ' 
' Well , it's not exactly the same , ' said Hagrid , not quite open . ' We are just very careful , ' because you and Olympe , we have broomsticks , sometimes - ' 
Ron made a sound almost half as loud as a whistle and a half - breath and hurriedly took a sip of tea . 
' so we do not have much trouble . 
We are like a vacation together , and we went to France like we were ... ' 
Uncle went straight to the school of Olympes , ' because we would have been followed by the Ministry of the tail . 
We have to go very slowly , ' because he did not really use magic and the ministry secretary was looking for reasons to detain us . 
But we tried to get the dog to hang around it . ' Dee - John - ' 
' Oh no , Dijon ? " Hermione said excitedly . ' I was there on holiday , did you see - ? ' 
She stops when Ron's expression is revealed . 
' We have the opportunity to use magic and that is not a bad trip . 
We ran like crazy giants to the Polish border , and there was a bit of a disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk , but then everything went smoothly . 
' And when we arrived , we went along the mountain trail , searching for their sign ' 
We can not use magic when we are near them . 
Partially ' because they do not like witches and we do not want them to turn their backs too early , and 
in part ' because Dumbledore has warned us all - who - well - know - that everyone is intent on the giants . 
It seemed strange but he sent a message to the giants . 
He said that we must be very careful not to draw attention to them when we are there in case there are death spirits around him . ' 
Hagrid stopped to take a large sip of tea . 
' Come on ! " Said Harry urgently . 
We found them , ' Uncle Hagrid said colorless and somewhat boastful . 
We crossed a cliff at night and saw them there , just below us . 
There are small fires burning and huge shadows that look like moving mountains . ' 
' How big are they ? " Ron asked in a low voice . 
' About 20 feet high , ' said Hagrid . 
Some are even as high as 25 feet . ' 
' And how many are they ? ' Asked Harry . 
' I think it's about 70 or 80 , ' said Hagrid . 
' that's all ? ' Said Hermione . 
' Oh , yes , ' said Hagrid sadly , ' there are only 80 people , and about 100 other groups around the world . 
But they are dying from time to time . 
The witches kill some , of course , but mostly they kill each other , and now they die faster than ever . 
They are not forced to live together like this . ' Dumbledore said it was our fault , that the witches ' fault forced them to leave and live away from us , and that they had no chance to unite to protect themselves . ' 
' And then , ' said Harry , ' you see them and what happens after that ? ' 
' We wait until the next morning , because we do not want to go to them with a sneak peek at night , for our own safety , ' said Hagrid . " At around 3 am they were asleep at their place . " 
We dare not sleep . 
Because we want to make sure that none of them wake up and go to where we stand , and another reason is that your snoring is not very reliable . 
There is a snowstorm near dawn . 
' Anyway , when it's morning , we go down and meet them . ' 
' How are you going ? ' Said Ron , looking frightened . ' Uncle simply go straight to the tent of a giant ? ' 
' Well , Dumbledore showed you how to do it , ' said Hagrid . ' Give the Gur presents , show him your respect , the grandsons . ' 
' Who gave you gifts ? ' Asked Harry . 
' Ồ , gur - means the head . ' 
' How can you know who the leader is ? ' Asked Ron . 
Hagrid grunted with pleasure . 
' Very simple , ' he said . ' The head is the biggest , most ugly , and most lazy . 
The person just sat there waiting for others to bring peace offerings . 
The dead goats and the like . 
That person's name is Karkus . 
He estimated he was about 22 to 23 and was about the size of two male elephants . 
The skin looks like rhino skin . ' 
' And you go straight to him ? " Hermione breathlessly said . 
' We go to where he is in the valley . 
They were in a valley between a beautiful mountain , beside a mountain lake , and Karkus was lying on the edge of the lake shouting for the others to bring him and his wife back . 
Olympe and I go down the slopes - ' 
' Did not they try to kill you when they saw you ? " Ron asked skeptically . 
' Surely they have that idea in their heads , ' said Hagrid , and shrugged his shoulders , ' but we are what Dumbledore said , that is to lift the gift up , to look away from him . Head out and ignore the others . That's what we did . 
And the rest of us will watch over us quietly and we can go straight to Karkus's feet , bow our heads and place gifts in front of him . ' 
What gifts did you give ? ' Asked Ron eagerly . ' Food ? ' 
' No , he has all the food he needs , ' said Hagrid . ' We bring him a miracle . 
The giants like magic , they just do not like us to use magic against them . 
Anyway , it was the first time we gave them a bunch of Gubraithian fire . ' 
Hermione whispered , ' That can not be ! ' but Harry and Ron both frowned . 
' A beam - ? ' 
' Flames of immortality , ' said Hermione snubbly , ' you should know that Professor Flitwick mentioned it twice in the classroom ! ' 
' Oh , anyway , ' said Hagrid quickly , interrupting before Ron could respond , ' Dumbledore casts a spell on the fire so it never burns off , it's not all wizards . I could do it , and I placed the cluster of fire on the snow at Karkus's feet and said , " A gift from Albus Dumbledore to the Giant Head with the most respectful greetings . " 
' And what did Karkus say ? " Asked Harry impatiently . 
" Nothing , " said Hagrid . ' He does not speak English . ' 
' Uncle joking ! ' 
' Not at all , ' said Uncle Hagrid , without hesitation , ' Dumbledore warned him of that . 
Karkus tight enough to shout a few giants of our language and he translated it for him . ' 
' So he likes gifts ? ' Asked Ron . 
' Of course , it was like a storm when they understood what that was , ' said Hagrid , flipping the dragon meat and putting his cool face on the swollen eye . ' They are very satisfied . 
And then he said , " Lord Albus Dumbledore asks the Heads to answer you a message when we come back to the same gift tomorrow . " 
' Why do not you tell them that day ? ' Asked Hermione . 
' Dumbledore wants us to proceed slowly , ' said Hagrid . Let them see that we will be between the promises . 
We come back tomorrow with another gift and we come back with another gift - to make a good impression on them ? 
And give them time to check whether our first gift is good , making them more eager . 
In any case , giants like Karkus - will infiltrate them with infinite information and they will kill just to make things simpler . 
So we just bow , go out and find a nice little cave for the night , and the next morning we come back , this time we see Karkus waiting for us , all of them are very eager . ' 
' And you talked to him ? ' 
' Ờ . First of all , we give him a beautifully worn helmet - goblins made and it can not be destroyed , the kids know - then we sit down and start chatting . . ' 
' What did he say ? ' 
' Not much , ' said Hagrid . " He listens primarily . 
But they show good signals . 
He had heard about Dumbledore , that he was opposed to destroying the last giant in England . 
Karkus seems to be very concerned about what Dumbledore has said . 
And a few others , especially those with little English , gathered around and listened . 
We had a great deal of hope when we left that day . 
We promised to come back the following morning with another gift ' 
' But that night , it all changed . ' 
' What do you mean ? " Said Ron impatiently . 
' Oh , as you said , they do not live together , those giants , ' said Hagrid sadly . ' Not as big as this . 
They can not help themselves , every few weeks , they kill each other half way . 
People 
Men fight men , women fight each other , and they fight not even because of scuffles for food , fire or good sleeping . 
Think about it , try to imagine how their fight ended , they separated , but " 
Hagrid breathed a beat . 
That night , a war broke out , we saw it from the cave mouth that we spent the night , we looked down into the valley . 
The battle will last for a few hours , and you will not be able to imagine that horrible noise . 
And when the sun rose , the snow was dying red , and his head was lying there . ' 
Who's your head ? " Said Hermione gasp . 
' Karkus's , ' said Hagrid harshly . 
They had a new head , Golgomath . He sighed . ' We did not bargain with the new head for two days after we established a friendly relationship with the first , and we have the feeling that Golgomath will not be eager to listen to us . , but we have to try . ' 
' Uncle go talk to him ? ' Asked Ron frightenedly . ' After you saw him cutting off another giant's head ? ' 
' Of course we have to do that , ' said Hagrid . ' We can not go that far and give up everything after only two days ! 
We go down there with the next gift we're about to give Karkus . 
' I did not know that before he opened his mouth . 
He sat there , wearing Karkus's head cap , glaring at us as we approached . 
He was huge , one of the biggest people there . 
He has black hair , fine teeth and a bone necklace . Some seem to be human bones . 
He handed the gift - a large roll of dragon skin - and said , " A gift to the Giant's Head - " the next thing he was told was that he was hanging upside down in his leg , hovering in the air gas , his two entourage grabbed him . ' 
Hermione held both hands over her mouth . 
' How could you get out of that ? ' Asked Harry . 
' You will not be able to escape without Olympe there , ' said Hagrid . ' She pulled out the wand and made the quickest spell he had ever seen . 
This is amazing . 
Attack the two of you in the eye with the curse of Conjunctivitus and they must let go - but we were in big trouble then , ' because we used magic against them , and that was the thing . the hated giants of the witches . 
We have to escape quickly and we know that there is no way to get into that tent anymore . ' 
' Oh , Hagrid , ' Ron said quietly . 
' How long did you come back here if you only stayed there for three days ? ' Asked Hermione . 
We did not leave after three days ! Uncle Hagrid said , looking outraged . ' Dumbledore trusted us ! ' 
' But I said there is no way to get back there ! ' 
' It is as natural as day , that we can not do it . 
We just think a little . stay a few days in the cave and watch ' . 
And what we see is not good . ' 
' He cut off someone's head ? ' Asked Hermione , her voice resentful . 
' No , ' said Uncle Hagrid , ' I wish he had his head cut off . ' 
' What do you mean ? ' 
I mean , we soon discovered that he was not against the whole world of wizards - he just opposed us . ' 
' Death Eaters ? ' Harry said quickly . 
' Yes , ' said Hagrid grimly . ' Someone visits him every day , brings gifts , and he does not hang up the flood . ' 
' How do you know these are Death Eaters ? ' Said Ron . 
' Because you recognize one of them , ' Uncle Hagrid snarled . ' Macnair , do you remember that old man ? 
The executioner sent to kill Buckbeak ? 
Maniac , it's him . 
Love to kill like Golgomath ; Do not expect them to be kind . ' 
' The Macnairs have convinced the giants to follow the Who - who - knows - who ? ' Said Hermione . 
' Do not guess , you have not told me yet ! Uncle Hagrid said indignantly , he was the one who initially did not want to tell them anything , now seems very excited . ' Uncle and Mrs. Olympe talked to each other and we agreed on that . ' 
' cause the head who seems to lean toward the One - Know - Who does not mean that all the giants are like that . 
We must try and persuade others who do not want Golgomath to be the Head . ' 
' How can you tell who they are ? ' Asked Ron . 
' Well , they are the ones who are beaten , right ? Uncle Hagrid said very patiently . 
Those who wish to stay away from Golgomath , hide in those caves around us as we do . 
And then we decide to rummage around the caves at night and find out if we can convince some of them . ' 
' Uncle Grope in the dark caves to find the giants ? ' Said Ron , obviously having respect in his voice . 
' Yes , not the giants are most concerned about us , ' said Hagrid . 
Death Eaters are very interested in watching us . 
Dumbledore has told us that we try not to stir up the bubbles if we avoid that , and the problem is that they are around us - ' said Golgomath to them . we . 
At night , when the giants were asleep and we wanted to go into the caves ,, Macnair and another sneakily hovered over the mountains to find us . 
You have had a hard time stopping Olympe from jumping on them , ' said Hagrid , the edge rising , raising her beard , ' she was anxious to attack them so hard to describe . Excited , Mrs. Olympe is on fire , the kids know ' probably because of the French blood in her body ' 
Hagrid gazed dreamily at the fire . 
Harry let me flashback for 30 seconds before calling on him . 
' Then how about that ? 
Are you close to the other giants ? ' 
' What ? Ah , yes , we met . 
Yes , on the third night after Karkus was killed , we walked away from the cave we hid and headed down the valley , and watched as there were Death Eaters around . 
Let's go into some caves , but we do not see anyone - then , in the sixth cave , we meet three big men who are hiding . " ' 
' That cave must have been packed , ' said Ron . 
' It's not a room for a Kneazle , ' said Hagrid . 
' Did not they attack you when they saw you ? ' Asked Hermione . 
' Surely they would do it if they could , ' said Hagrid , ' but they were badly wounded , all three ; Golgomath struck them unconscious ; They woke up and crawled into the nearest hiding place they could find . 
Luckily , one of them can speak a little English and he translates it to others , and the things we say seem to be not so bad . 
So we continue to come back , visit the wounded Uncle think we have about six or seven people have believed in a point . ' 
' Six or seven ? ' Said Ron excitedly . ' It's not bad - so they come here and we fight with Who - knows - who - is not it ? ' 
But Hermione said , " What is your mind when you say " in one spot , " said Hagrid ? ' 
Hagrid looked at her sadly . 
' Golgomath scours the caves . 
The survivors do not want to continue with us . ' 
' So will not any giant come here anymore ? ' Said Ron , looking disappointed . 
' No , ' said Hagrid , letting out a long breath as he turned the cool face of the meat up in his face , ' but we did what we were going to do , we gave them Dumbledore's message , some of them have heard the message and some believe that the message will be remembered . 
Maybe they will not want to stay with Golgomath , they will leave the mountains , then there is a chance they will remember Dumbledore's friendliness and maybe they will come here . ' 
The snow is falling out the window . 
Harry noticed that his shirt was soaked : Fang was panting as he leaned over his lap . 
' Uncle Hagrid ? ' After a moment , Hermione quietly said . 
' Huh ? ' 
' Do you have any indication what you heard about your mother when he was there ? ' 
Hagrid's unobstructed eyes stopped on the girl and Hermione looked scared . 
' I'm sorry I forgot it - ' 
' was dead , ' murmured Hagrid . ' died many years ago . 
They told him so . ' 
' Oh my dear , ' said Hermione in a very small voice . 
Hagrid shrugged his shoulders . 
' No need , ' he said shortly . ' You can not remember much about her either . 
She is not a good mother . ' 
They were silent . 
Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron , apparently waiting for them to open their mouths . 
' But I have not explained how you are in this situation , Hagrid , ' said Ron , gesturing to Hagrid's bloody face . 
' Or why did you come back so late , ' said Harry . ' Uncle Sirius said Maxime had returned to her place for a long time - ' 
' Who attacked you ? ' Said Ron . 
' Uncle attacked ! Uncle Hagrid said affirmatively . ' Uncle - ' 
But the end of the sentence was stopped suddenly by the door . 
Hermione gasped ; her song slipped from her fingers and fell apart on the floor ; Fang barking . 
Four people stared at the window next to the entrance . 
The shadow of a small and dimly dimmed man appeared through the thin curtain . 
' She is ! ' Ron whispered . 
" Hurry up here ! ' Said Harry urgently ; Grabbing an invisibility cloak , he covers it with himself and Hermione as Ron runs around the table and underneath the shirt . They crowded together , they gathered into the corner . 
Fang barked madly at the door . 
Hagrid looked confused . 
' Uncle Hagrid , hide our shifts ! ' 
Hagrid held Harry and Ron's songs , stuffing them under the rug in Fang's nest . 
Fang was clawing at the door ; Hagrid pushed the dog out of the way and opened the door . 
Professor Umbridge was standing in front of the door , wearing a green woolen cap , a hat of the same color with two earplugs . 
With a pout , she leaned back to look at Hagrid's face ; She just stood up to her navel . 
' So , ' she said slowly and loudly , as if speaking a deaf person . ' You are Hagrid , are not you ? ' 
Without waiting for an answer , she went into the house , her eyes wide in all directions . 
' Come out , ' she snapped , catching her handbag at Fang , who was jumping up and trying to lick her face . 
' I do not want to be rude , ' said Hagrid , and stared at her , ' but what the hell are you ? ' 
' My name is Dolores Umbridge . ' 
Her eyes covered the hut . 
They looked straight at the corner of Harry's face , twice between Ron and Hermione . 
' Dolores Umbridge ? " Uncle Hagrid said , sounding confused . " I think she works in the Ministry - she works with Mr. Fudge , right ? ' 
" I am the Minister's Senior Assistant , yes , " Umbridge said , and walked back and forth in the tent , scrutinizing everything , from the dagger to the wall to the traveling gown . out . ' Now I'm the Dark Arts teacher - ' 
' She is brave , ' said Hagrid , not many people wanted to take that job . ' 
" - and as the Hogwarts Higher Education Inspector , " Umbridge said , showing no sign of her hearing his words . 
' What ? " Uncle Hagrid said and frowned . 
' Exactly what I was going to ask you here , ' said Umbridge , pointing to the broken porcelains on the floor of Hermione's song . 
' Well , ' said Hagrid , glancing at the base of the house where Harry , Ron and Hermione were hiding , ' Well , that's because of Fang . 
It breaks the shit . 
So I have to use this instead . ' 
Uncle Hagrid pointed at the song that he was drinking , a doctor still hugging beef on the eye . 
Umbridge stood facing her , examining her face in detail , not looking around the tent anymore . 
' I heard a voice , ' she said quietly . 
' I talked to Fang , ' said Uncle Hagrid . 
' And did he answer you ? ' 
' In that respect , ' said Uncle Hagrid , in discomfort . ' I can sometimes say that Fang is close to human - ' 
There were three footprints on the snow that led to my tent , long ago , ' said Umbridge sweetly . 
Hermione gasped ; Harry held her hand up and covered her mouth . 
Fortunately , Fang was sniffing around Umbridge's tiara and she did not seem to have heard the noise . 
' Well , I just got back , ' said Hagrid , waving his hand toward the bag . " Maybe someone came to call me early and I did not see them . ' 
' There is no oil left to leave the hut . ' 
' Well , I do not know , ' said Uncle Hagrid , tugging his beard tensely and glancing back at Harry , Ron and Hermione standing , as if asking for help . ' Ahem ' 
Umbridge hovered around the house , scrutinizing the length of the tent , carefully examining it . 
She knelt down under the bed . 
She opened Hagrid's cupboard . 
She crossed two inches across to Harry , Ron and Hermione pressed against the wall ; Harry's stomach was fluttering as she passed . 
After scrutinizing the huge cauldron Hagrid used for cooking , she turned around and said , ' What happened to you ? 
How could he have these wounds ? ' 
Hagrid hurriedly removed the dragon's meat from his face . In Harry's opinion , his method seemed wrong , because the black cloud around his eyes now looked more distinct , not fresh blood and dry . on the doctor's side . ' Well , I got a little accident , ' I said hesitantly . 
' How was the accident ? ' 
' I - I fell . ' 
' I fell down , ' she repeated solemnly . 
' Yes , yes . slowly broom a friend . 
I do not fly . 
You see , with my body like this , I do not think any broom can carry me . 
My friends have breed like Abraxan horses , I do not know if you have ever seen them , chest breasts , wings , she knew , I was riding a bit and then - 
' Where were you ? ' Umbridge asked , coldly interrupting Hagrid's stuttering voice . 
' I did - ? ' 
' Where , yes , ' she said . 
The semester started two months ago . 
Another teacher should get up for you . 
None of my colleagues can give me any information about where he is . 
Uncle did not leave the address . 
Where were you ? ' 
There was a pause while Hagrid stared at her with unblocked eyes . 
Harry could almost hear his head working wildly . 
' I - I'm healing , ' he said . 
' Healing , ' recalls Professor Umbridge . 
Her eyes looked at Hagrid's swollen and discolored face ; Bloody dragon ball slowly on the line on the back of his uncle . ' I understand . ' 
' Yes , ' said Hagrid , ' I need some fresh air , you know ... ' 
' Yes , as a doorman , fresh air is hard to find , ' said Umbridge sweetly . 
The small , purple or black spots on Hagrid's face widened . 
' Ah yes ... just change the air a bit , she said ... ' 
' Mountain air ? said Mrs. Umbridge sweetly . 
" She knew , Harry thought desperately . 
' Mountain ? " Hagrid repeated , obviously he was thinking so fast . ' No , I went to the south of France . a little sunshine and sea . ' 
' Really ? said Mrs. Umbridge . ' You do not seem to be very tanned . ' 
' Yes , I have sensitive skin , ' said Hagrid , trying to smile . 
Harry noticed that the two teeth were broken . 
Mrs. Umbridge looked at her coldly ; His smile turned into hesitation . 
Then she picked up her bag a little bit taller , tucked it in her hand and said , ' Of course I will have to tell the Ministry that I'm late . ' 
' Okay , ' said Hagrid , nodding his head . 
" You also need to know , as a High School Education Inspector , that my task is very unfortunate , but it is necessary for me to inspect my fellow teachers . 
So , I can say that we will meet again soon . ' 
She turned and walked out the door . 
' She inspected us ? Hagrid repeated , blankly looking at her . 
' Well , yes , ' said Umbridge softly , looking back at her while one hand was on the door knob . 
The ministry decided to remove some inappropriate teachers , said Hagrid . 
Good night . ' 
She left after closing the door . 
Harry gets out of the invisibility cloak but Hermione pulls her wrists back . 
' Not yet , ' she breathed in his ear . ' She may not have gone yet . ' 
Hagrid seemed to think so too ; He ran across the room and pulled the curtain over a few inches . 
' She's coming back to the castle , ' he lowered his voice . ' Oh , inspector people , is she right ? ' 
' Yes , ' said Harry , coming out of his shirt . 
Ms . Trelawney is in the ' 
' How undervalued was the plan for the class , Uncle Hagrid ? ' Asked Hermione . 
' Oh , do not worry about it , I arranged for the homilies for you , ' said Hagrid enthusiastically , picking up the dragon meat from the table and putting it in his eyes . I have a number of creatures dedicated to the school year I take the Lead Standard Witchcraft ; Let's wait and see , they are really special . ' 
' What's the special way ? Hermione asked nervously . 
' You will not say ' , ' said Hagrid happily . ' I do not want you to lose the surprise . ' 
' Carefully , Hagrid , ' said Hermione impatiently , she did not pretend , ' Professor Umbridge will not be happy if I bring anything into danger . ' 
' Danger ? Uncle Hagrid said , looking stunned . ' Do not be so stupid , I ' ll take something dangerous into the classroom ! I mean , they can take care of themselves ... ' 
' Uncle Hagrid , you must pass Umbridge's inspection , and it would be really good if she saw you get up to how we were to take care of the Porlocks , or tell us the difference between Knarls and Porcupines Europe , things like that ! ' Said Hermione earnestly . 
" It's not fun , Hermione , " said Hagrid . 
Something that impressed me a lot . 
You have had them for years , I think you are the only one who has this kind of creature in England . ' 
' Hagrid please , ' said Hermione , a little desperate in her voice . Mrs Umbridge is seeking an excuse to shake off the teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore . 
Please , Hagrid , teach us something is enough for us to pass the Common Witchcraft Exam . ' 
But Hagrid just yawned and turned his gaze toward one of the huge beds in the corner . 
' Look , I've had a very long day and it's been too late , ' he said , tapping Hermione's shoulder , causing her knees to fall and hit the floor . ' Oh - I'm sorry - ' Uncle grabbed her collar and pulled her up . ' Do not worry too much for me , I promise you that you have been well prepared for your class , you have come back now all of you are better off going back to the castle , and do not have Forget about the footprint behind us ! ' 
' I do not know if you can convince him , ' Ron said after a moment , when they checked out no one and returned to the castle , wading through the heavy snow , clearing the trail behind him . by the Obliteration spell Hermione made when they left . 
' I ' ll be back tomorrow , ' said Hermione . 
Even prepare the lecture for him if necessary . 
I do not care if she chases Miss Trelawney but she can not get rid of Hagrid ! ' 
Chapter 21 : THE SUNS OF THE MOUNTAIN 
Hermione returned to Hagrid's hut on a thick layer of snow on two Sunday mornings . 
Harry and Ron wanted to go with her , but the mountain of their homework came to an alarming level , and they reluctantly stayed in the common room , while the other students entertained with skidding . the frozen lake , skiing and , worse yet , casting the snowballs to Gryffindor Tower and banging on windows . 
Oh ! Shouted Ron , finally losing patience and poking his head out of the window , I was a chauffeur and if there was a snowball on the window then - OUCH ! 
He fluttered his head , his face covered with snow . 
As Fred and George , he said angrily , stomping the window . the stingers 
Hermione returned from Hagrid's place just before lunch , trembling , her gown draped over her knees . 
So ? Said Ron , looking up as she entered . Have you prepared all the lessons for him ? 
Oh , I tried , the dark girl said , sitting in the chair next to Harry . 
She draws away the wand and performs a complicated wave that causes a stream of warmth to emerge from the end of the wand ; Then she pointed it to her cloak , to dry it . He was not even there when I came , I knocked at least an hour . 
And then he came out from the forest . 
Harry moaned . 
The Forbidden Forest is full of creatures capable of causing Hagrid to be fired . What does he raise in there ? 
Does he say ? she asked . 
No , Hermione said miserably . 
He said he wanted to surprise them . 
I tried to explain about Umbridge , but he did not understand . 
He goes on to say that no one wants to learn Knarl with Chimaera < a kind of monster , often seen in FF games - oh , I do not think he's raising a Chimaera , she added with a The look of panic on Harry and Ron , but apparently he has not tried , as he lamented how hard it is to get their eggs . 
I have said so many times that he should follow Grubbly's textbook - Plank , honestly I do not think he heard half of what he said . 
He is very excited , you know . 
And he refused to tell me why he was hurt . 
The return of Hagrid's teacher's desk at breakfast the next morning was not greeted by the students . 
Some , like Fred , George and Lee , cheered and ran along the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to capture Hagrid's huge arm ; Others , like Parvati and Lavender , exchanged sad looks and shook their heads . 
Harry knew that many of them liked Professor Grubbly - Plank's lessons , and at least a little bit of it understood that they had a good reason : Grubbly's ideal class - Plank is not a class that someone can lose head . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione are afraid to go down to Hagrid's classroom on Tuesday , which they wear to fight the cold . 
Harry was worried , not only for what Hagrid could use to teach them , but also about the attitude of the rest of the class , especially Malfoy and his party , if Umbridge came to watch the class . 
No one , however , saw that Advanced Inspector when the whole class went through the snow toward Hagrid , waiting for them at the edge of the Forest . 
His appearance does not create peace of mind ; The purple bruises on Saturday have now turned green and yellow , and some of his wounds are still bleeding . 
Harry could not understand this : Could Hagrid be attacked by a venomous creature that caused his wounds to heal ? 
As if to complete the overcast picture , Hagrid carries something that looks like a half dead cow on his shoulders . 
Today we will study there ! Hagrid happily called the students who were coming , nodding toward the dark trees behind him . There is more discreet ! 
Anyway , they also like darkness ! 
What do you like the dark ? Harry heard Malfoy say to Crabbe and Goyle , a look of terror in his voice . He said something like darkness - are you listening now ? 
Harry remembered that there had been only one case in which Malfoy entered the Forbidden Forest ; This name is not very courageous . 
He smiles to himself ; After the last Quidditch match , anything that made Malfoy unhappy made him happy . 
Ready to go ? Hagrid said cheerfully , looking around the classroom , out of earshot , prepared a trip to the Forbidden Forest for the fifth year . 
Imagine that we can go and see mysterious creatures in their natural habitat . 
Now , the things we're going to learn today are very harsh , we think we may be the only people in the UK who can train them . 
Are you sure they are trained ? Malfoy said , the terror in his voice was clear . Just because this is not the first time that you brought horror into the classroom , right ? 
The Slytherin House agrees and some Gryffindors also seem to think that Malfoy is fair . 
Of course they were trained to do so , Hagrid said , scowling and lifting his dead cow higher up , 
What happened to your face ? Asked Malfoy . 
Not your game ! Hagrid said furiously , Now , if we have already asked these silly questions , follow us ! 
He turned and walked straight into the Forest . 
No one seemed willing to follow him . 
Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione , who sighed but nodded , and the three of them started following Hagrid , leading the class . 
They walked for about ten minutes and they came to a place where the trees grew so dark that the darkness was dazzling and there was no snow on the ground . 
With a grunt , Hagrid threw his cow on the ground again , stepping back and facing the whole class , most of whom were wandering through the trees toward him , looking around as anxiously as he could . Waiting will be attacked at any time . 
Gather here , gather here , Hagrid encourages , Now , they will be fascinated by the smell of meat and I will also call them , because they cling and like me . 
He turned around , shook his head to shake his hair off his face and made a strange cry echoing through the dark trees as the call of some giant birds . 
No one laughs : most of them are too afraid to make a sound . 
Hagrid took up the horror call again . 
A moment passed , the class continued to panic over his shoulder and look around at the trees trying to find out what was coming . 
And then , as Hagrid flicked his hair back the third time and took out his huge breasts , Harry pushed Ron and pointed to a black area between two dense yew trees . 
A pair of white , lifeless , and glowing eyes were rising through the dim darkness and a moment later a dragon's face , neck and bony figure of a large , black and winged horse appeared . from dark areas . 
He looked around the classroom for a few seconds , waving his long and black tail , then lowered his head and began to tear the flesh from the dead cow with his sharp fangs . 
A sense of relief spread over Harry . 
At least this also proves that it does not imagine these animals : they are real and Hagrid knows about them . 
She glanced eagerly at Ron , but Ron stared blankly at the trees , and after a few seconds muttered , why did not Hagrid try calling again ? 
Most of the remaining students in the class are also embarrassed and anxious to wait like Ron and look everywhere except where the horse is standing about a food from them . 
Only two people seemed to be able to see them : a thin Slytherin boy stood behind Goyle , who was staring at the horse with a look of disgust on his face ; and Neville , his eyes on each of the long black waving flats . 
Oh , another one ! Hagrid said proudly , as a second black horse emerged from the dark trees , closed his skin close to his body and lowered his head to the flesh . Now , who can see them , they raise their hands . 
Extremely satisfied when he finally felt the mystery of these horses , Harry raised his hand . 
Hagrid nodded to him . 
Yes , I know you can see , Harry , and he went on to say , uh , uh , Neville ? 
Ua ... 
Sorry , Malfoy said in a scornful voice , but exactly what would we have to see ? 
To answer , Hagrid pointed toward the cows on the ground . The class gazed at it for several seconds , then many of them gasped and Parvati screamed . 
Harry understood the reason : the pieces of meat that had broken out of their bones and disappeared into the empty air would have looked extremely weird . 
What is it doing ? Parvati asked in a horrified voice , backing away from the nearest tree , What was eating it ? 
Thestral , Hagrid proudly said and Hermione whispered Ồ ! In the back of Harry's mind , Hogwarts School has a colony here . 
Come on , who knows ... ? 
But they are very bad luck ! Parvati interrupted , looking frightened . They will bring terrible unhappiness to those who see them . 
Professor Trelawney has told me once - 
Hips , hips , Hagrid said , giggling , that's just superstitions , that is , they do not bring bad luck , they are smart and extremely useful ! 
Of course , they do not have much to do , their main duty is to pull the school bus unless Dumbledore wants to go far without wanting to go out - look , there's another pair - 
Two more horses gently slipped out of the tree , one parvati near Parvati , shivering like a dry tree and hugging the tree , saying , I think I just felt something , I felt it near close to me ! 
Do not worry , it will not hurt you , Hagrid said patiently . 
Now , who can tell me how some people can see some of them ? 
Hermione raised her hand . 
Only some people can see the Thestral , she said , those who saw death . 
Exactly , Hagrid said solemnly , ten points for Gryffindor . 
Now , Thestral - 
Hem , hem . 
Professor Umbridge has just arrived . 
She stood a few feet away from Harry , still wearing a hat and a green shawl , his profile in hand . 
Hagrid , who had never heard Umbridge's cries before , was staring at the nearest Thestral , apparently thinking that the animal had made the sound . 
Hem , hem . 
Oh , hello ! Hagrid said , smiling . He found out where the noise came from . 
He received my notice sent to his tent this morning ? Umbridge said , with the loud and slow voice she used to talk to him before , as if she was talking to a foreigner and very slowly . 
Tell him I will inspect his class . 
Oh , yes , Hagrid said cheerfully , Very glad she can find the place ! 
Oh , can you ... or , I do not know ... can you ? 
Today we study about Thestral ... 
Sorry ? said Professor Umbridge , raising his hand to his ear and frowning . What did you just say ? 
Hagrid looked a bit confused . 
Ờ - Thestral ! he said loudly . Horses ... well ... winged wings , you know ! 
He slammed his big arms in a hasty way . 
Professor Umbridge frowned at him and as she noted on the record : to use the rude language sign 
Oh , anyway Hagrid said , turning to the class and looking confused , erm said 
Where is the bow ? 
It seemed to have bad memory Umbridge muttered , loud enough to be heard . 
Draco Malfoy looked happy as if the Christmas season was coming soon all month ; Hermione , in contrast , flushed and turned angry . 
Oh , yes , Hagrid said , throwing a glare at Umbridge's profile , but still determined to continue . Yes , I will say to you now that we have a flock . 
Oh , first we got a male and five females . 
This one , he just pointed to the horse first appeared < insane , how many people see where only - LHX > , its name is Tenebrus , it is my favorite , the first child was born in the forest . 
Did you know , Umbridge said , interrupted him , that the Ministry of Magic classified Thestral as a dangerous group ? 
Harry's heart was petrified , but Hagrid merely laughed . 
Thestral is not dangerous ! Agreed they might be slightly aggressive if they are really bothered ... 
offer . 
the gratification of the violent idea , Umbridge mumbled , continuing on the dossier . 
No ... Hagrid , look angry now . I mean , even a dog will bite if it gets poked , is not it - but Thestral was bad at just about the problem with the chit - they thought they were bad , right ? 
But they are not ? right ? 
Umbridge did not answer , she finished the last note , then looked up at Hagrid and said , still very big and slow , Please continue to teach as usual , I will go , she pretends to be moving ( Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson burst into laughter in silence ) , among the students , ( she pointed at the students in the class , and asked them questions , she just gestured for the talk . 
Harry stared at her , obviously not understanding why she behaved like Hagrid did not understand normal English . 
The tears of anger were burning in Hermione's eyes . 
Mi is a witch , a witch wicked ! she whispered , as Umbridge walked over to Pansy Parkinson , I know what you're doing , the nasty , the ugly , the ugly ... 
Like Hermione , Pansy was crying , but because she laughed so hard ; Actually , its answers are almost nothing to be honest because it has to try to keep its giggle . 
Not because it seems like a grunt at all times . 
Umbridge scrawled over the pair of records . 
Hagrid's swollen face was reddened , but he tried to behave as if he did not hear Pansy's answer . 
Oh yes the good thing about Thestral . 
Well , when they are domesticated , like these , never let us lose them . 
They have a good sense of direction , just tell them where you want to go ... 
Of course assume that they understand you , " Malfoy said loudly , and Pansy Parkinson dumped the thing for a new laugh . " Umbridge smiled warmly at them and turned to Neville . 
Can you see Thestral , Longbottom ? she said . 
Neville nodded . 
Did you see the dead ? she asked in a strange voice . 
My grandfather , Neville said . 
What do you think about them ? she said , waving her rough arm toward the horses , now scouring the large corpse to the bone . 
Erm , Neville said excitedly , glancing at Hagrid , oh , they looked so good 
The students were threatened not to admit that they were frightened by Umbridge , who continued to record . 
Are not ! Neville said , looking confused , No , I'm not afraid of them ! 
All right , Umbridge said , patted on the shoulder with a smile that she clearly seemed to understand , even to Harry , it looked more like a glance . 
Well , Mr. Hagrid , she turned back to him , in a loud and slow voice , I thought I had collected all the necessary information . 
You will receive ( as if you were taking something from the air in front of you ) the result of your inspection , ( she just put up a briefcase ) , in ten days . She raised her friends ' fingers , and her smile widened and she looked more like a toad than ever before under her blue hat , and she rushed in front of everyone , causing Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson laughed again , and Hermione shook her head in anger and Neville looked confused and confused . 
old , silly , lousy and ghostly ! Hermione burst out a half hour later , when they returned to the mansion on the snow - covered walkway they had gone before . You see what she wants ? 
She goes on to do what she did with the hybrids - she tried to make Hagrid like a gigantic dark demon , just because he had a huge mother - and it was not . It's not a bad lesson - I want to say , of course , if it's a Tail - tail , then the Thestral is good , - in fact , for Uncle Hagrid , they are really great ! 
Umbridge said they were dangerous , Ron said . 
Oh , as Hagrid says , they can watch over themselves , Hermione says impatiently , and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly - Plank is not going to show us anything like that before we get there . Get NEWT certificates , but , are they really interesting ? 
There are some who can see and some others can not ! 
If only I could see . 
Do you want Harry asked her gently . 
She looked like she was suddenly terrified . 
Oh , Harry - I'm sorry - no , of course not - to say such a thing is stupid . 
That's fine , Harry said quickly , do not worry . 
I'm surprised that so many people can see them , Ron said . this is a class ... 
Yes , Weasley , we just wondered that , a malicious voice resounded . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were walking behind them , but no one heard them in the snow . Do you think that if you see someone die then you can see the Quaffle better ? 
He , Crabbe , and Goyle laughed as they jumped up and headed for the castle , and began to sing the Weasley chorus as King of ours . Ron's ear is red . 
Ignoring them , Hermione whispered , drew her wand and again made the spell create hot air , so she put them on an easier path to cross . Without touching the snow between them and the glass house 
* 
In December , the snow is falling again , and the falls of the homework for the fifth year students are still coming . 
Ron and Hermione's bosses become increasingly burdensome when Christmas approaches . 
They were called to oversee the decor of the castle ( we had to hang the needle thread while the Peeves held one end and tried to strangle us with those things , Ron said ) , to watch over the students . In the first and second year , we only had a break in the house because it was too cold ( And they were really stupid little boys , you know , we're not that bad . I learned the first year , Ron said ) and to walk the corridors along with Argus Flinch , who doubted that the festive atmosphere could cause fights among the witches . bean , Ron said angrily ) . 
They were so busy that Hermione had to stop knitting hats and she snapped when she put down her last three . 
The poor elves who have not released themselves will have to stay here for Christmas because they do not have enough hats ! 
Harry could not even tell you that Dobby had cleaned up all the clothes she had made , and she bent down to her Magisterial Essay . 
In any case , it does not want to think of Christmas . 
For the first time in his student life , he wanted to get away from Hogwarts . 
Having been banned from playing Quidditch and worried whether Hagrid was challenged or not , he felt that this place was boring at the moment . The only thing that really looked forward to was the DA meetings , and these were also halted on holiday , when nearly all DA members were away with their families . 
Hermione would go skiing with her parents , which made Ron very interested , had never heard of Moogle tying pieces of wood to his feet to slip from the mountain . 
Ron will return to his home at The Burrow . 
Harry had to endure several days of living in jealousy before Ron , in response to Harry asking him about going home for Christmas : But he would go too ! 
Do not you say ? 
Mother wrote it I invited him last week ! 
Hermione's eyes widened , but Harry's spirit was lifted up : the thought of enjoying Christmas in The Burrow was wonderful , though Harry was still guilty of guilt that he could not sleep with Sirius . 
He did not know that he could persuade Mrs. Weasley to invite her godfather to attend the holidays . 
Although he doubted whether Dumbledore would allow Sirius to leave Grimmauld Square , it was impossible to think that Mrs. Weasley could have liked him ; they often disagree with each other . 
Sirius had not contacted Harry since his last appearance in the fire , and although Harry knew that Umbridge was constantly following up on things , it was unwise to try to contact him , He did not like to think that lonely Sirius lurked in his mother's old house , and could have been alone with Kreacher . 
Harry came to the Request Room early in the last DA meeting , and it was fun , because when the torches glowed he realized that Dobby was decorating himself for Christmas . 
It can be said that Dobby has done this , since no one else can hang a hundred gold jewels along the ceiling , each of which appears in Harry's face with the words : HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY BIRTHDAY ( A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS ) ! 
Harry just barely had the last shot down before the door opened and Luna Lovegood came in , still dreaming as usual . 
Hello , she said absently , looking at the remaining specimens . Really , do you ? 
No , Harry says , it's Dobby . 
The mistletoe , Luna dreamily said , pointed to a large branch of tree with bunches of whites lying almost atop Harry's head . 
It jumped out of position just below the tree . Goodbye , Luna said solemnly , It is often sabotaged by the Nargles . 
Harry goes back to asking what Nargle is because Angelina , Katie and Alicia come in . 
They all gasped and seemed very cold . 
Oh , Angelina said sadly , took off her jacket and threw it into the corner , we finally replaced us . 
Replace us ? Harry said impatiently . 
You and Fred and George , the hot girl said , we have a new look ! 
Who is that ? Harry asked quickly . 
Ginny Weasley , Katie says 
Harry looked up at her . 
Yes , I know , Angelina said , pulling her wand out and bending her arms , but she was fine too . 
Of course not with you , little girl , give it a look of lazy , but when we do not have you 
Harry wanted to retaliate with what it had been long since : when did she think she had regretted being banished from her team a hundred times ? 
What about the players ? he asked , trying to keep his voice natural . 
Andrew Kirke , Alicia says not very enthusiastic , and Jack Sloper . 
None of them are excellent , but if compared to the other idiots that appear there 
The appearance of Ron , Hermione and Neville ended this discouraged conversation , and five minutes later the room was full enough to stop Harry from looking at Angelina's impatient gaze . 
Okay then it says , call people back order , I think we should review tonight what we have done so far , because this is the last rehearsal before the holiday and so should not take a lesson what's new before the three week holiday ... 
We will not do anything new ? Zacharias Smith said , with an angry whistle large enough to spur the room . If I knew this , I would not have come . 
Then all of them apologized that Harry had not told him before , Fred said loudly . 
Many laughed . 
Harry saw Cho laughing and feeling his heart pulsating in a familiar way , as if he had just stepped down a ladder . 
... we can do it in pairs , Harry said . We start with the WORD back in ten minutes , then we roll the mattress out and do the Stun Quests back . 
They split the pair according to his orders , Harry still paired with Neville as usual . 
The room was filled with Impedimenta . 
Those who hit the stick freeze for about a minute , while you practice their look around the room , looking at the other pairs , until their friends are resolved and take turns to practice . this curse . 
Everyone has acknowledged that Neville has made remarkable progress . 
A moment later , when Harry had to throttle three times in a row , he let Neville join Ron and Hermione again so he could walk around the room and watch the others . 
When she went to Cho , the little girl happily looked at her ; He tried hard not to come back to her again . 
After ten minutes of cessation , they spread the mattresses on the floor and practiced the Stun Quests . 
The space is limited so that all of them can practice this mantra at the same time ; Half of the group observed the practice for a while , then they changed the session . 
Harry felt really proud when he watched all of you . It was true that Neville had stunned Padma Patil rather than Dean , who he was aiming for , but the deviation was shorter than usual and the others had improved . 
About an hour , Harry called everyone to stop . 
You do well , it says , happy to see people , When we come back after the holiday we can start to practice harder things - maybe even Patronus . 
The whisper of excitement sounded . 
The room began to sparse as each group of two and three familiar friends left , most of whom wished Harry Christmas cheerfully as they passed . 
Feeling excited , he and Ron and Hermione took back the mattresses and stacked them on top of each other . 
Ron and Hermione leave before it's done , it lingers a little because Cho is still there , and she hopes to receive a cheerful Christmas greeting from her . 
No , you go ahead , he hears her talk to her Marietta , and her heart jerks it . 
It pretends to straighten the mattress . 
It must have been just two of them and he waited for her to speak . 
But he heard the noise . 
She turned around and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room , tears streaming down her face , 
What ... ? 
He does not know what to do . 
She stood there , crying quietly . 
What's going on ? she said weakly . 
She shook her head and wiped her tears . 
I ... sorry , she said tiredly , I thought that it was only when learning all these spells it just made me think that the price he also knows he probably is still alive . 
Harry's heart fluttered , and now it was tightly closed somewhere around his navel . 
It should have known this . 
She wants to talk about Cedric . 
He knew all these spells , Harry said heavily . 
He does them well , otherwise he can not get in the middle of the maze . 
But if Voldemort wants to kill someone , he does not have a chance . 
She hiccups when she hears Voldemort , but stares at Harry unabashedly . 
You survived as soon as you were just a baby , she was quiet . 
Yes , Harry said tiredly , going to the door , I do not know why or anyone else could do it , but nothing worth proud of . 
Oh , do not go , Cho shouted , full of tears . I'm really sorry to make things so sad so I do not want to 
She hiccups again . 
She looked beautiful , despite her eyes red and bruised . 
Harry felt totally distressed . 
It must have been a happy Christmas . 
I know it's scary for you , she said , wiping her eyes with her sleeve , I mean Cedric , when you see him dying you think you just want to forget it ? 
Harry did not say anything about this ; That's right , but it feels so cruel . 
You are m ... a very good teacher , you know , Cho said , with a watery smile . 
I've never done a Stun Gun before . 
Thanks , Harry said awkwardly , 
They looked at each other for a long time . 
Harry felt the intense urge to run out of the room , but at the same time , his legs were completely unable to move . 
The mistletoe , To speak softly , pointing to the ceiling above his head . 
Yes , Harry said . 
Its mouth is dry . But it may also be covered by Nargle . 
What is it ? 
I do not know , Harry said . 
She stepped closer . 
It seems to be hit by a Stun Blast . You should ask Loony . 
I want to say Luna . 
For giving a funny sound between sobs and laughter . 
At this point , she was closer to Harry . 
It can even count the freckles on her nose . 
I like you very much , Harry . 
Harry could not think of anything . 
A sense of confusion spreads across it , making its hands , legs , and brain paralyzed . 
She was close by . 
Harry could see tears streaming down her lashes 
Harry returned to the common room an hour and a half later , seeing Hermione and Ron sitting in the best chairs in the stove , everyone else had gone to sleep . 
Hermione was writing a very long letter , she wrote more than half a roll of parchment , was swinging from the edge of the table . 
Ron was lying on the mat , trying to finish his dissertation . 
Why stay so long ? he asked , as Harry sat in the chair next to Hermione . 
Harry did not reply . 
It was still shocking . 
She wanted to tell Ron and Hermione about what had happened , and half wanted to bring this secret down to her grave . 
How are you , Harry ? Hermione asked , looking over it from the top of her fur . 
Harry shrugged reluctantly . 
Actually , it does not know whether it is healthy or not . What's going on ? Said Ron , raising his elbows to look at Harry more clearly . 
What happened ? 
Harry did not know to start telling you that , and it was still not really sure he wanted to . 
So it decided not to say anything . 
Hermione tugged at her hand . 
Is not it ? She asked , did she stay with you after the meeting ? 
Dumbfounded , Harry nodded . 
Ron laughed , but stopped short when meeting Hermione's eyes . 
So ... 
Um ... what does she want ? he asked in a voice acting inadvertently . 
She's ... Harry started , slightly hoarse , he cleared his throat and tried again . She's ... oh 
Kissed yet ? Asked Hermione briskly . 
Ron sat up so fast that his ink bottle fell on the carpet . 
Absolutely disinterested in it , he gobbled up at Harry . 
How ? she asked . 
Harry looked at Ron's curious and funny face , then looked at Hermione's slightly frown , then nodded . 
HA ! 
Ron was a happy punch with his punch and laughed in a hoarse voice and made a bunch of shy second - year students outside the window startled . 
A reluctant smile was attached to Harry's face as he watched Ron roll over the carpet . 
Hermione looked at Ron with an utterly disgusted look and returned to her letter . 
How ? Ron finally spoke , looking up at Harry . What is it ? 
Harry hesitated a bit . 
Wet , it says honestly . < echo > 
Ron emits a loud noise that can be a hint of joy , which can be disgusting , hard to say . 
Because she was crying , Harry said heavily . 
Oh , Ron said , smile away , So when you kissed them feel bad ? 
I do not know , Harry said , he did not think about it , and immediately felt anxious . Maybe I see that . 
Of course you are not , Hermione said absently , still writing to the letter . 
How do you know ? Said Ron quickly . 
Because crying for several days , Hermione responded indifferently . She is crying at lunchtime , in the toilet , and elsewhere . 
Do you think kissing will make him happy ? Said Ron , grinning . 
Ron , Hermione said in a dashing voice , dipping the ink into her ink cartridge , you are the most innocent man in the world that I was unlucky to encounter . 
What does that mean , Ron said irritably . 
What kind of people are crying while kissing ? 
Yes , Harry said , a bit desperate who would do that ? 
Hermione looked at her with a pitying expression . 
Do not you understand Cho's feelings at that moment ? she asked . 
No , both Harry and Ron said . 
Hermione sighs and puts it down . 
Oh , obviously she was saddened by Cedric's death . 
And I think she's confused because she likes Cedric and now she likes Harry , and she does not know who she likes the most . 
Then she felt guilty , thinking that he had insulted Cedric's memory when he kissed Harry , and then he was worried about what other people were saying about him when he started going out with Harry . . 
And he can not understand his feelings for Harry at this moment , because anyway Harry is the one who's with Cedric when Cedric dies , they mix and make she feels miserable . 
Oh , and she's scared she's going to be knocked out of the Ravenclaws Quidditch team just because she's been bad lately . 
A squeaky silence welcomes the end of the talk , and Ron says If a person feels all of that at the same time it explodes . 
Just because your affection is just filled with a teaspoon does not mean that we are all the same , said Hermione with a disgusted expression and picked up the pen again . 
She's not the starter , Harry says , I do not ... she's just coming over ... 
And the next thing is he cried to me ... I do not know what to do ... 
Your friend , do not blame yourself , said Ron , seeming to think very lively . 
You have to be gentle with her , Hermione said , seeming worried , did you do that ? 
Oh , Harry said , his face flushed uneasily , I was like ... pounding her back slightly . 
It seems to be a very difficult task for Hermione at this point to recover from her condition . 
Oh , I thought that was not bad , she said . 
Will you meet her again ? < Is not it ? > 
Still have to meet that ? Said Harry . We still have DA meetings , right ? 
You know what you mean , Hermione says impatiently . 
Harry did not say anything . 
Hermione's words open up a frightening scene in front of her . 
He tried to imagine a place to take Cho - perhaps Hogsmead - and only had him with her for hours . 
Of course she will wait for her to take her to play after what has just occurred this thought to stomach it back pain < stomach is also suffering pain - laugh > 
Oh , okay , Hermione said coolly , leaning back to her letter , you would have plenty of opportunity to ask her . 
What if he does not want to ask her ? , Said Ron , who was watching Harry with a weird look on his face . 
Do not be silly , Hermione said absently , Harry liked her for a long time , right , Harry ? 
It does not answer . 
Yes , it has long been liked , but whenever it imagines a scene with only two of them , it is always Cho's image that is happy to smile , completely opposite to Cho sighs . can not rest on his shoulder . 
Who are you writing the novel for ? Ron asked Hermione , trying to read the parchment spread out on the floor . 
Hermione hid it from sight . 
Mr. Viktor . 
Krum ? 
How much do we know Viktor ? 
Ron did not say anything , but it sounded disgusted . 
They sat silent for another twenty minutes , and Ron finished the essay on his Transfiguration , with many hot snatches and scissors , and Hermione remained awake and wrote the parchment , wrapping it and sealing it . And Harry glared at the fireplace , hoping Sirius would come out and give her advice about the little girl . 
But the flames continued to fade and fade away , until the charcoal samples became ash . 
Looking around , Harry found again that they were the last remaining people in the common room . 
Oh , late at night , Hermione said , yawning as she headed for the ladder . 
What is the point in Krum ? Asked Ron , as he and Harry climbed up the stairs for his son . 
Oh , Harry said , showing interest in the matter , I think because he's older , is not he and he's an international Quidditch player ? 
But other than that , Ron said , the more annoyed I was , he said , he was a bitch , right ? 
Oh , quite a bit , yes , Harry said , his thoughts turned to Cho . 
They took off their robes and put on their pajamas in silence ; Dean , Seamus and Neville have long slept . 
Harry placed his glasses on the bedside table and lay on his bed as if he had not pulled the curtain around his four posters ; Instead , he stared at the starry sky through the window frame next to Neville's bed . 
If it knew it , it happened tonight , in the twenty - four hours it had kissed Cho Chang 
Sleep well , Ron said , from somewhere on the right it . 
Sleep well , Harry said . 
Maybe next time if she will be happy next time . 
She should have invited her to go out , she may be waiting for her and is now feeling angry or she is lying in bed , still crying for Cedric ? 
He wants to think again . 
Hermione's explanation makes it all the more complicated instead of easier to understand . 
They should teach us about this , how they think , how they are , what the mind of the girls is anyway , this is more useful than the Divination . 
Neville snorted sleepily . 
And one owl hovered in the night . 
Harry dreamed that he had returned to the DA room . 
Cho is accusing her of having seduced her with a fake reason , she said , promising her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if she came . 
Harry protested to yell at England Cedric gave me countless chocolate frog card , look at this ! Then she pulled out a card from the cloak and threw it into the air . 
Then she turned to Hermione , who was saying , You promised her that Harry thought you should give him something else to make up your lightning bolt ? And Harry protested that it was impossible for his Lightning , because Umbridge had taken it , and even afterwards it was all so funny , it just went to the DA room just to hang some pictures . The Christmas decorations look like Dobby's head 
Dream changes 
Its body seems very flexible , strong and soft . 
It was gliding between the bright metal bars , across the frozen rocks , the darkness that was on the floor , slipping on its belly . The scene was so dark it could see what was around it . The colors were brilliant and strange . It looked back at first when it seemed as if the corridor was empty but no crowded man was sitting in front of the ground , his jaw dropped to his chest , his shape flushed . dark 
Harry stuck his tongue out to feel this man's incense in the air we were still alive but was sleeping dreamily sitting in front of the door at the end of the corridor . 
Harry wanted to bite the man but he had to control his emotions and it was more important to do it . 
But the man who moved a silver Coat dropped from his leg as he jumped up , and Harry could see a glistening and shimmering silhouette above him , seeing the wand of the waist was no choice . She rose from the ground and bitten one , two , three times , plugging her fangs into the flesh of the man , feeling his ribs crumble beneath his jaw , 
The man screamed in pain and he silenced him back to the wall of blood splashing on the ground . 
His forehead ached with pain as it burned 
Harry ! 
HARRY ! 
It opened its eyes . 
His whole body was covered with cold sweat ; Its bed sheets roll around like a bundle ; It felt as though there was a white baked iron stove that touched his forehead . 
Harry ! 
Ron was standing at his bed , looking very frightened . 
There are many others at the foot of Harry's bed . 
She was holding her head with her hands , the pain that made her face dark . She curled up and vomited into a corner . 
He was sick , a voice scared him , Should call someone ? 
Harry ! 
Harry ! 
He had to tell Ron , it was important to tell him to take a sip of air , Harry pushed him back to bed , trying not to throw himself away , the pain that made his eyes blossom . 
His father , his panting , his chest pounding , his father was attacked 
What ? Said Ron , looking unconcerned . 
Your father ! 
He was bitten , very serious , blood everywhere 
I called out to help the old voice still horrible , and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dorm . 
Harry , sweetie , Ron said hesitantly , he only just dreamed . 
Are not ! Harry said angrily ; Life is about to make Ron understand . 
Not a dream . It's not a dream I used to be 
He hears Seamus and Dean whisper but does not care . 
The pain on his forehead was reduced , though he still felt sweat pouring out and shivering . 
He left again and Ron stepped back . 
Harry , he was not well , he said shakily , Neville ran to call the help . 
I'm fine ! Harry sobbed , wiping his mouth with his nightgown and trembling uncontrollably . 
There is nothing wrong with me , you have to worry about your father - we need to find out where he is - he dyed blood - I was - it was a giant snake . 
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed it back , and Dean and Seamus whispered next to him . One or ten minutes passed , Harry did not know ; She just sat there and shivered , feeling the wounds softening from her scar and having so many footsteps hurried up the stairs , and she heard Neville again . 
here , professor . 
Professor McGonagall hurried into the dorm in her striped dress , her glass sliding down her nose . 
Why , Potter ? 
Where are you hurt ? 
He had never been so happy to see her , a member of the Phoenix Army that he needed now , not somebody fussing over it and giving it some sort of medicine . . 
Ron's dad , she said , sat up . He was attacked by a serpent , very serious , I saw it happen . 
What do you want to say , do you see it happening ? said Professor McGonagall , her dark eyebrows knit . 
I do not know you sleep and I'm there 
I want to say you dream ? 
Are not ! Harry said angrily ; Why does not anyone understand it ? First I dream of something completely different , the nonsense and then it cut off . 
It is true , I can not imagine . 
Uncle Weasley sleeps on it and is attacked by a giant serpent , blood spilling all over , he drops , someone must find where he is . 
Professor McGonagall stared at her through the glasses as she was shocked at what she was seeing . 
I do not lie and I'm not crazy ! Harry said to her , his voice rising to a scream . I told you , I saw it ! 
I believe you , Potter , Professor McGonagall said neatly . Get dressed , we go to see the principal . 
Chapter 22 : THANH MUNGO HOSPITAL 
Harry was relieved that she was serious about not hesitating , she jumped out of bed , dressed , and put on her nose . 
' Weasley , you should go over here , ' said Professor McGonagall . 
They followed Professor McGonagall across Neville's motionless bodies , Dean and Seamus , to the bedroom , down the spiral staircase to the common room , through the hole in the portrait and away . Along the corridor there is a portrait of Mrs. Fat by the moonlight . 
Harry felt as if the fear inside it could flow at any moment ; he wants to run , he wants to call Dumbledore ; Mr. Weasley was still bleeding when they went silent , and whether the fangs were poisoned ( Harry hardly tried not to think of his ' fangs ' ) ? 
They passed by Mrs. Norris , who was looking at them with eyes like a lamp and hissing at the noise , but Professor McGonagall said , ' Go ! ' She ducked into the shadows , and a few minutes later , they headed for the statue of a stone statue in front of Dumbledore's office entrance . 
' Fizzing Whizzbee , ' said Professor McGonagall . 
The statue came alive and slipped sideways ; the wall behind the split in half reveals a continuous stone staircase that moves like a spiral escalator . 
The three of them went up the stairs to move ; the wall behind them closed the thug and they moved upward in small circles until they reached a shadowy oak wing on the door with a fist knocking on the monster's door . lion head bird . 
Although the middle of the night was long , there were still voices coming from inside the room , as if someone was murmuring . 
It seems Dumbledore is having fun with at least a dozen people . 
Professor McGonagall gestured to the door three times and the voices stopped instantly as if someone had twisted them off . 
The door opened , Professor McGonagall pushed Harry and Ron in . 
Twilight room ; strange silver tools stand on the tables and still clatter and emit smoke as usual ; Old portraits and the principal covered with dormant walls sleeping in paintings . 
Behind the door , a magnificent yellow and red bird , the size of a swan sleeping dreamily on a beanstick , huddled his head on his wing . 
' Oh , you , Professor McGonagall and here a . ' 
Dumbledore was sitting behind a high chair behind the table ; She was leaning toward the candlelit light that was shining on the sheets of paper in front of her . 
He wore a yellow and purple embroidered gown emblazoned with a snow - white sleeping gown , but he seemed to have woken up a long time , and his bright blue eyes met Professor McGonagall . 
' Professor Dumbledore , Potter has a bad nightmare , ' said Professor McGonagall . ' She said ' 
' It's not a nightmare , ' Harry said quickly . 
Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with disdain . 
' Okay , Potter , tell the schoolmaster the story of the game . ' 
' My son , I'm sleeping , ' said Harry , and even though it was still horrifying and desperate to make Dumbledore understand , he still felt the Rector was not looking at him but was looking at the fingers . hands knit together . ' But that was not a normal dream , it was real . I saw it happen . ' He took a deep breath , ' Ron's father , ' Uncle Weasley , ' was attacked by a giant snake . ' 
Those words seemed to hang in the air as it said them , their sound a bit funny , even funny . 
A moment stopped as Dumbledore leaned back and gazed at the ceiling . 
Ron looked away from Harry to Dumbledore , his face white and dumbfounded . 
' How did you see that scene ? " Dumbledore asked quietly , still not looking at Harry . 
' I do not know , ' said Harry in anger , ' does that make sense ? ' I guess you see in my head ... ' 
' You misunderstand me , ' said Dumbledore calmly . I mean you can remember - well - where did you stand when you saw that attack happen ? 
Could you stand next to the victim , or see the scene from above ? ' 
It was a curious question , and Harry gasped ; It's almost like he knows everything 
' Com is a snake , ' he said . ' Look at everything as a snake . ' 
For a moment , no one was able to say a word , then Dumbledore looked at Ron standing there with a white face and asked in a sharp voice , " Are you Arthur seriously injured ? ' 
' Yes , ' said Harry in a confident voice , ' why are they all so slow to understand that no one knows how big a person can be when they are pierced by teeth ? ' so on the ribs ? 
And why did Dumbledore not look down on him ? 
But Dumbledore stood up , making Harry jump up , pointing at one of the old portraits hanging near the ceiling . ' Everard ? he says sharp . ' And you , Dilys ! ' 
A witch with a yellow face , a black short beard and another older woman with long curly hair in the side frame , both seemingly sunk into deep sleep , they open Eyes open when asked . 
' Have you heard all this ? ' said Dumbledore . 
The wizard nodded ; And the witch said , ' This is natural . ' 
' The man has red hair and glasses , ' said Dumbledore . ' Everard , you will have to take that vigil , make sure he's the right person to discover - ' 
Both nodded in agreement and moved away from the picture frames , but they did not appear in the next picture ( as is often the case at Hogwarts ) or appeared . 
A frame now has nothing but the dark wall of the curtain , in the other , people just see a leather armchair breeze . 
Harry noticed that there were many other principals or principals on the walls , though they were snoring and drooling , but still secretly stole it through the lids , and suddenly he understood who was talking . when they knocked . 
' Everard and Dilys are two of Hogwarts ' most celebrated principals , ' said Dumbledore , now circling Harry , Ron , and Professor McGonagall to the sleek , sleeping bird on the door near the door . 
Their reputation is enough for their portraits to be suspended in the headquarters of other important sorcerers . 
And because they are free from their own portraits , they can tell us what is happening somewhere . " 
' But Uncle Weasley can be anywhere ! ' Said Harry . 
' Sit down , ' said Dumbledore , as if Harry had not said anything , ' Everard and Dilys have not been able to return yet . 
Professor McGonagall , can you get extra chairs ? ' 
Professor McGonagall pulled the tree out of his pocket and waved ; Three chairs appeared in the air , wooden chairs , straight back , almost the same as Dumbledore's softly decorated sofa that appeared at the trial of Harry . 
Harry sat down , staring over Dumbledore's shoulders . 
Dumbledore now stroked the blond head of the Fawkes with one finger . 
The phoenix wakes up immediately . 
He reached for his beautiful head and watched Dumbledore with his dark and bright eyes . 
' We need to , ' said Dumbledore smoothly to the bird , ' a warning . ' 
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix fly away . 
Dumbledore took a thin silver device and Harry did not know the utility , carried it over his desk , sat down across from them again and taped it with his wand . 
The tool comes alive with chirping chirps . 
Small , light blue smoke ejected from the tiny tube on the top . 
Dumbledore drew close to seeing the smoke , his brows furrowing . 
After a few seconds , the thin smoke became a thick smoke and circled in the air , a snake - shaped head slowly rising at the end of the smoke , its mouth open . 
Harry wondered if this device was confirming its story : he looked at Dumbledore with all his might to find a sign that it was true , but Dumbledore did not look up . 
' Very natural , very natural , ' Dumbledore was obviously murmuring , still observing the smoke without being surprised . ' But their nature is dichotomy ? ' 
Harry could not catch the head or tail of this question . 
However , the snake's head in the smoke began to split into two snakes , both curled up in the dark air . 
With a satisfied look , Dumbledore knocked on the device again with his wand : the sound slowed and stopped , the snake faded , its shape became unclear and finally turned . lost . 
Dumbledore put the tool back on the small turntable for it . 
Harry saw many former principals in the portraits watching him , then realized that Harry was watching them quickly pretending to be sleeping . 
Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver stuff was for , but before he could do that , there was a cry at the top of their right wall ; The witch named Everard has reappeared in his portrait , his breath panting . 
' Mr. Dumbledore ! ' 
' Do you have any news ? " said Dumbledore . 
' I'm screaming until someone runs up , ' said the witch , who was rubbing his forehead on the curtain behind him , ' I'm sure I heard something down the ladder - not sure they believed it . I did not go down to check - you know , there's no portrait to look at . 
Anyway , they also brought him a few minutes later . 
He did not look so good , he was bloody , I ran into the portrait of Elfrida Cragg to see clearly when they were gone - 
' Very good , ' said Dumbledore as Ron motioned for a panicked motion . ' I'm sure Mrs. Dilys will see him come , then - ' 
And a little later , the curly - haired witch appeared in her portrait ; She threw herself on the couch , cleared her throat and said , ' Yes , they brought it 
He came to St Mungo Hospital , Dumbledore they brought him across the portrait with me he looks so bad ' 
' Thanks , ' said Dumbledore . 
He looked up at Professor McGonagall . 
' Minerva , you need to wake up the Weasleys . ' 
' Of course ' 
Professor McGonagall stood up and ran to the door . 
Harry threw a glance at Ron , who looked frightened at the moment . 
' Mr. Dumbledore - what about Molly ? Professor McGonagall said , stopping at the door . 
' That's for the Fawkes after it makes a round of checks to see if anyone is approaching , ' said Dumbledore . ' But she might have known she had a great watch ' 
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock not to see the time but to inform the location and status of the Weasley family members , and with a puzzled mood as he thought of the needle Weasley is now pointing at the deadly danger . 
But now it is very late . 
Mrs. Weasley must have been asleep and could not watch the clock . 
Harry felt cold as he remembered Mr. Weasley's lifeless body , his glasses deflected , the blood flowing down his face , but Mr. Weasley could not die . 
Dumbledore now searches for something in the cupboard behind Harry and Ron . 
Pulling out of the cupboard an old black kettle and carefully placed on the table . 
He raised his wand and muttered , ' Portus ! " For a moment , the warmth shook , and the vivid blue light looked so strange ; Then it shakes slightly when it turns black . 
Dumbledore went through another portrait , this time a clever witch with a sharp beard , painted in a Slytherin green and silver outfit , who apparently slept very well . He could not hear Dumbledore's voice when he tried to wake him up . 
' Phineas . 
Phineas . ' 
The characters in the other portraits hanging on the wall of the room do not continue to pretend to be sleeping again ; They move in the picture frames and keep track of what's going on . 
When the cleverly intelligent wizard continues to pretend to be asleep , some of them begin to call out his name . 
' Phineas ! 
Phineas ! PHINEAS ! ' 
He could not continue to pretend to sleep ; He was startled and opened his eyes wide . 
' Does anyone call me ? ' 
' I need you to visit another portrait of yourself again , Phineas , ' said Dumbledore . ' I have another message to send . ' 
' Visit another portrait of me ? " Phineas said in a wry voice , opening his false yawning mouth ( his eyes swirled around the room and stopped at Harry ) . ' Oh , no , Dumbledore , I'm so tired tonight . ' 
Something in Phineas's voice was very familiar to Harry , where did he hear it ? 
But before it could come up , the portraits on the surrounding walls screamed in protest . 
' That is not submissive ! ' a witch has a red nose , big fat fluttering fists . ' Ignorance is the duty ! ' 
' We are honored to serve the Head of Hogwarts ! " A sorcerer screamed , this man Harry recognized as Dumbledore's predecessor , Armando Dippet . ' What a shame for you , Phineas ! ' 
' Do I need to persuade him , Dumbledore ? " A witch with sharp eyes , holding an unusually large wand , looked like a birch wood . 
' Oh , come on , ' the witch named Phineas said , glaring at the wand , ' although he was able to destroy my portrait completely at the moment , he did so . with most of his family ... ' 
' Sirius did not destroy his portrait , ' said Dumbledore , and Harry immediately recognized it had heard Phineas's voice before : from the empty picture frame in the bedroom at the Castle in the Square Grimmauld Place . ' Please send Sirrus a message that Arthur Weasley has been seriously wounded , and that his wife and his children and Harry Potter will come to his home immediately . 
Do you understand ? ' 
' Arthur Weasley , injured , wife , son and Harry Potter are coming there , ' Phineas repeated in a bored tone . ' okay , okay ' 
He slipped out of the frame of the portrait and momentarily disappeared . 
The door opened again , and Fred , George , and Ginny were brought in by Professor McGonagall , all three of whom were hairy , still in pajamas , and looked dumbfounded . 
' Brother Harry ... what's wrong ? ' Ginny asked fearfully . ' Professor McGonagall said he saw my father being hurt ... ' 
' Three of you were injured while doing the mission of the Brotherhood of the Phoenix , ' Dumbledore spoke before Harry could speak . He was taken to St Mungo Hospital for the treatment of illnesses and injuries caused by magic . 
I took you back to Sirius ' home , where it would be more convenient for you to visit the hospital than at the Hangout Farm . 
You will meet your cheeks there . ' 
' How are we going ? ' Fred asked , sounding shaky . 
With Floo powder ? ' 
' No , ' said Dumbledore , ' Floo is not safe at this time , the Network is being monitored . 
The children will use the port lock . " He pointed to the old kettle lying on the table . ' We will wait for Phineas Nigellus to return to report the situation . I want to make sure everything is safe before taking the kids away ... ' 
Suddenly sparks lit up the room and a single golden feather glided to the floor . 
' That's the Fawkes notice , ' said Dumbledore , picking up the feather as it fell . ' Professor Umbridge must have known you were leaving Minerva's bed , you should have misled her ... tell her something ... ' 
Professor McGonagall came out with a rustle of clothes . 
' He said he was very happy , ' said a voice behind Dumbledore ; The witch named Phineas appears in front of his Slytherin banner . ' My grandchildren have always had a strange taste for their guests . ' 
' Come here , ' said Dumbledore to Harry and the Weasley children . ' Hurry up , before anyone shows up . ' 
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore's table . 
' Have you ever used Harbor ? " Dumbledore asked , and all nodded , all reaching out to touch a part of the black kettle . ' Good . Count to three , three , one two ' 
It only happened for a fraction of a second : the thought stopped for a moment before Dumbledore said ' Daddy , ' Harry looked up at them - they were so close together - and Dumbledore's bright blue eyes shifted from that . Lock the port on its face . 
Immediately , the scars burned up , as if an old wound had come up - unannounced , unwanted , but very strong , inside Harry , it felt a burning hatred . , as if he wanted nothing more than to be beaten - bitten - plugged his teeth into the man in front of him - 
' father . ' 
Harry felt very strong jerking in the center , the ground disappeared under his feet , his hands sticking to the kettle ; It bumps into the others as they all rush into the whirlwind of color and whirlwind , and the warmth pushes them until it hits the ground , causing the knee to collapse . warm and heavy on the ground , and somewhere close , the voice said : 
' Come back , you insults , they betray the blood . 
Is it true that their father was dead ? ' 
' go out ! " the second voice growled . 
Harry stood up and looked around ; They were standing in the dark basement kitchen of House 12 , Grimmauld Square . 
The only light source is the fire and a candle illuminates the rest of the dinner for one person . 
Kreacher had disappeared through the door leading into the lobby , looking back at them maliciously as he tightened his belt ; Sirius rushed to them , looking very tense . 
He has not shaved and is still wearing his day clothes ; Uncle Mundungus rancid when he drinks . 
' What's up ? he said and held out his hand to help Ginny stand up . 
Thineas Nigellus said Arthur was seriously wounded ... ' 
' Ask Harry , ' Fred said . 
' Yes , I want to hear , ' George said . 
Brother brother and Ginny staring at it . 
Kreacher's footsteps stopped at the outer staircase . 
' That's ... ' Harry started ; It's worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore . ' I have ... a capacity ... to look 
And it tells them all that they see , however it chooses to tell the story as if seen as an outsider when the snake attacks , not from the snake's eyes . 
Ron is still white but does not say anything . 
When Harry ends , Fred , George and Ginny keep staring at it for a moment . 
Harry did not know if it was imaginary , but he felt it was a bit of an accusation in their eyes . 
If they were to blame it on seeing the attack , it was glad they did not tell them it was actually the snake in the story . 
' Is your mother here ? ' Fred turned to Sirius . 
' Surely she did not know what had happened , ' said Sirius . 
It is important to take the children out before Umbridge can come in . 
He thought Dumbledores had told Molly now . ' 
' We want to go to St Mungo's Hospital , ' Ginny urged . 
She looked at her brothers ; They are still wearing pajamas . ' Sirius , can you lend us a coat or something to wear ? ' 
' Honestly , you can not go to St Mungo's Hospital ! " said Sirius . 
' Of course we can go if we want , ' Fred said stubbornly . ' That's three of us ! ' 
' So how do you intend to explain how your children know their three children were attacked even before his wife ? ' 
' What's wrong ? ' George said impatiently . 
' The problem is that we do not want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is capable of seeing things going on hundreds of miles away ! " Sirius said angrily . ' Can you imagine how the Ministry would respond to that information ? ' 
Fred and George looked as if they did not care what the Ministry could do . 
Ron was still pale and kept silent . 
Ginny said , ' There must be someone telling us we have to hear from someone other than Harry . ' 
' Ai who ? Sirius said impatiently . ' Listen , your father is injured while on duty with the Brotherhood , the situation is very unclear and his children can not know as soon as it happens , you can cause serious damage . important for Assembly ... ' 
' We do not care about that damn guild ! ' Fred shouted . 
' Our three are the ones who are dying ! ' George exclaimed . 
" Your father is aware of what he is doing and he will not thank you for messing up this Society ! Sirius said , equally angry . 
It is because of that - that is why you are not joining the Society - you do not understand - there are things we need to sacrifice for it ! ' 
' You said it was easy , because you just sat here ! ' Fred roared . ' I see that you have to risk your life ! ' 
The pink color on Sirius ' face glared when he heard that . 
He looked for a moment as if trying to beat Fred , but as he started to speak , his voice was calm . 
' You know it's hard , but we all have to behave like we do not know anything . 
We have to stay here , at least until we hear the news from your mother , okay ? ' 
Fred and George still seem to want to protest . 
But Ginny took a few steps to the nearest couch , throwing herself into it . 
Harry looked at Ron with a laughing motion between nodding and shrugging , and finally they sat down . 
The twin brothers looked at Sirius for a few more minutes and then sat down beside Ginny . 
' That's good , ' said Sirius , in a cheerful voice , ' Come on , let's all drink something while we wait . 
Beer butter here ! ' 
He raised his wand as he spoke , and about half a dozen bottles of beer flew off the pavement , slid under the table toward them , scattering pieces of leftover food at Sinus's remaining meal , in front of six people . 
Everyone drinks beer , and in a moment the only sound is the sound of fire in the kitchen heater and the sound of bottle and light on the table . 
Harry drank just because his hands did not know what to do . 
His stomach twitches because of guilt guilty terrible . 
They were not here if not for it ; Everyone should have been in bed . 
And it's not good to say that the only alarm is to make sure we find Mr Weasley , because it can not escape the fact that it is the man who attacked Mr Weasley there . 
' Do not be silly , you do not have fangs , ' she said to herself , trying to keep herself calm , though her hand was holding a jar of shredded butter , you were lying on the bed , you were not attacking . Anybody 
' But then , what happened in Dumbledore's office ? he asked himself . 
I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore 
Unwillingly , it placed the beer bottle on the steam table and it poured on the table . 
No one cares . 
Then , a flame of fire exploded in mid air showing a dirty dish in front of everyone , and as they cried out in astonishment , a roll of parchment dropped to the table with a gold feathered tail feather . 
' Baby Fawkes ! ' Sirius said immediately and reached for the parchment . This is not Dumbledore's word - it must be from your mother ... right ... ' 
He tucked the letter into George's hand , ripping it out and reading aloud : ' I'm still alive . 
I will go to the hospital immediately . 
Stay still . 
Mom will send you news as soon as she can . 
Your cheeks . ' 
George looked around the table . 
' Still alive , ' he said slowly . ' But it sounded like ' 
It does not need to finish the sentence . For Harry too , it sounded like Mr. Weasley was lying between life and death . 
Still strangely pale , Ron stared at his cheeks from behind as if he would say words to comfort him . 
Fred pulled the paper out of George's hand and read it himself , then looked at Harry , who felt the hand of his beer begin to tremble and clench harder to stop it . 
Harry could not remember whether he had ever spent a night like this . 
One time Sirius tried to suggest but they were not convinced that they should go to sleep , but the insults of the Weasleys were enough to say the answer . 
Most of them sat around the table , silent , watching the candle melt into liquid wax , occasionally lifting the beer bottle to his lips , saying only when asked , wondering what was going on and to make sure If there is bad news they will know right away because Mrs. Weasley must have been at St Mungo for quite some time . 
Fred fell asleep , his head twisting to his shoulders . 
Ginny curled up like a cat in a chair , but her eyes were open ; Harry could see them glittering . 
Ron sat in his arms , unable to know whether he was awake or sleeping . 
Harry and Sirius often look at each other , who are intruding on the sadness of the family , waiting to wait 
At 10 : 05 pm Ron's clock , the kitchen door opened and Mrs. Weasley came in . 
She looked very pale and pale , but when they looked at her , Fred , Ron and Harry rose from the chair and she smiled tiredly . 
' You will be fine , ' she said in a weak and tired voice . ' I'm sleeping . 
We can visit three later . 
Now Bill is there ; He asked this morning . ' 
Fred fell back to the chair , his hands up from his face . 
George and Ginny get up , quickly go to her mother and embrace her . 
Ron smiled shakily and drank a bit of beer . 
' Breakfast ! ' Sirius said loudly and cheerfully , and jumped . ' Where are the horrible elves ? 
Kreacher ! 
KREACHER ! ' 
But Kreacher did not answer that call . 
' Well , forget it , ' Sirius muttered and counted the people standing in front of him . ' to see how many people are there - seven people with bacon and eggs , I think , a little tea , and toast - ' 
Harry hurried to the fireplace to help him . 
He did not want to intervene in the Weasleys ' fun and was afraid to think of the moment Mrs. Weasley suggested telling her what she saw . 
However , it still took the plates from the cupboard to the dishes while Mrs. Weasley took them out of his arms and hugged them . 
' I do not know what would happen if you did not see , Harry , ' she said , her voice clenched . 
They may not be able to find Arthur for hours , and it will be too late , but thanks to his nephew he is still alive and Dumbledore can think of a rational story explaining that Arthur is present at the place . I found him , I can not figure out how he would get into trouble if the situation is different , look at Mr. Poor Sturgis " 
Harry could hardly swallow her views , but fortunately she let it go , turned to Sirius and thanked him for keeping the children all night . 
Sirius said he was glad to help everyone , and he hoped the children would stay with him as long as Mr. Weasley was in the hospital . 
' Oh , Sirius , I'm really glad to say that he will be there for a while and there is nothing better than being around , of course , that means we're going to be here . Christmas . ' 
' As long as I'm happy ! " Sirius said sincerely , making Mrs. Weasley smile at her , dressing up the table and starting to help prepare breakfast . 
' Uncle Sirius , ' Harry whispered , he could not stand this moment anymore . ' Can you talk to me briefly ? 
Right now ? ' 
He went to the dark room and Sirius followed . 
Without giving a damn , Harry told his father to keep all the details he saw , including the fact that the snake had attacked Mr. Weasley . 
When it stopped breathing , Sirius said , ' Did you tell Dumbledore ? ' 
' I did , ' said Harry impatiently , ' but he never told me what that meant . 
Yes , he did not tell me anything . ' 
' But I'm sure you ' ll tell me if there's anything to worry about , ' said Sirius calmly . 
' But not yet , ' said Harry , with a low voice . ' Sirius , I think I'm going to lose my mind . 
When we were in Dumbledore's office , just before we grabbed the Quay Key for a few seconds there , I thought you were a snake , I felt like - my scar was sharp Look at Dumbledore - Sirius , I wanted to attack Dumbledore ! ' 
She could only see part of Siriuss's face ; the rest is in the dark . 
" That would be the consequence of what you see , that's all , " said Sirius . ' I'm still thinking of a dream or something so great and ... ' 
' No , ' said Harry and shook his head , ' it's like something rising up in you , like there's a snake in you . ' 
' You need to sleep , ' said Sirius firmly . ' Go breakfast , then go upstairs to sleep , and after lunch you can visit Arthur with the others . 
I was shocked , Harry ; You are blaming yourself for something you just witnessed , and fortunately I have witnessed it , otherwise Uncle Arthur could die . 
Do not worry anymore . ' 
He patted Harry's shoulder and left the chamber , leaving Harry alone in the dark . 
Everyone except Harry slept through the rest of the morning . 
She went upstairs to the bedroom where he and Ron had been together for the last few weeks , but while Ron was wrapped in his bed and set in a matter of minutes , Harry was still wearing his clothes , trying to bend The cold metal rod of the bed frame , deliberately keeping himself uncomfortable , determined not to fall asleep for fear he would once again become a snake in his sleep and wake up to find himself attacking . Ron , or crawl through the house attacking others 
When Ron woke up , Harry pretended he had just had a good sleep . 
Their chests arrived when they had lunch , so they could dress like Muggles to go to St Mungos's Hospital . 
Everyone , except Harry , was overjoyed and chattering as he changed his clothes , wearing jeans and short sleeves . 
When Tonks and Crazy Eye returned to escort them to London , they welcomed the two of them with great joy , laughing at the melon hat that the Crazy Eye Master had squatted to cover his eyes , However , it is true that Tonks with short , pink hair is less likely to attract attention . 
Tonks was very concerned about Harry seeing the attack on Mr. Weasley , but it was something he was not interested in discussing . 
' Are not there any prophets in your family at all ? she asked curiously , as they sat next to each other on the train and rushed to the city center . 
' No , ' said Harry , thinking to Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted . 
' No , ' said Tonks sternly , ' no , you do not think that's really a prophecy . You mean , you do not see the future , you see the present is so strange ? 
Very useful , although ' 
Harry did not answer ; As luck would have it , it was a station in central London , and while hustling down the train , it could follow Fred and George to stop it with Tonks on the way . 
Everyone followed her up the escalator , Moody went behind the group , his bowler hat fell , his master's bony hand in the button between the buttons , holding the wand . 
Harry felt the obscure eyes of his teacher was very attentive . 
Trying to avoid any questions about his dream , he asked Madam Eye what St Mungo Hospital was . 
' Not far from here , ' said Mr. Moody , as they stepped out into the windy air on a busy street full of shoppers for Christmas . 
He pushes Harry forward and i right afterwards ; Harry knew his god - eye was flipping in all directions under the hat . ' It's not easy to find a good place to put a hospital . 
There is no place in the X - Large alleyway and we are not going to put it underground as the Ministry of Magic is - the air is not good . 
Finally , people decided to build a building right there . 
Theoretically , ill sorcerers can come and go , just joining the crowd . ' 
He grabbed Harry's shoulders so that they were apart from each other by a group of shoppers wandering to shove them into a row of electric goods near by . 
' We're here , ' said Moody after a moment . 
They are standing outside a large , ancient store called Purge & Dowse Ltd . 
That place looks old - fashioned ; Through the window , some of the chubby haircuts can be seen wearing scattered wigs , standing scattered , and wearing outdated clothes for at least 10 years . 
On all the dirty doors , one could read at the large panels : ' closed for renovation ' . 
Harry heard clearly a woman carrying heavy plastic shopping bags told you when she passed by , ' This shop never opened ' 
" Exactly , " said Tonks , pushing them toward a window that displayed nothing but an ugly woman figure . 
The dummy's lashes were closed and she wore a green nylon gown . ' Are all ready ? ' 
People nodded , standing around her . 
Brother Moody pushed between Harry's shoulders so that it went forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass door , looking at the ugly dummy man , her breath blurring the glass . ' Wotcher , ' she said , ' chuns I came here to see Arthur Weasley . ' 
Harry thought Tonks was stupid enough to expect the dummy to hear her whisper , she whispered through the window , with a bunch of cars rattling behind her and the noise of the street full of people . go shopping . 
Then he reminded himself that dummy dolls could not be heard . 
Moments later , her mouth gaped open as the dummy nodded slightly and gestured with her finger jointed , and Tonks dragged Ginny and Mrs. Weasley's elbow back , stepping out the window and disappearing . 
Fred , George and Ron followed them . 
Harry glanced at the throng ; no one glanced at the ugly glass door of Purge & Dowse Ltd ; Or it seems that after the person has just vanished into the air right in front of their nose . 
' Come on , ' said Moody growled , pushing Harry again from behind , and they walked forward through a layer of cool water and appeared on the other side dry and warm . 
There are no signs of ugly dummy or where it stands . 
They are standing in a crowded area that looks like a reception , where there is a row of witches and witches sitting on rickety chairs , some perfectly healthy and reading attentively . The Witchcraft Weekly numbers are old , some of them appear to be horribly deformed such as having a large body like an elephant or having extra hands growing on the chest . 
The room was more frightening than the street because many patients were making strange noises : a wily sneeze on the face in the middle of the front seat , fan fanning in a newspaper . The prophet , who was making a whistling noise , and a breath of air coming out of her mouth ; A witch in the corner vibrates like a bell when moving , and every single one of his voices , his head vibrates fearfully so that he must hold his ear to keep it still . 
The sorceress and the sorceress wore yellow - blue robes walking along the rows of chairs , asking questions and taking notes in Mrs. Umbridge's record folder . 
Harry noticed the embroidered logo on their chest : a wand and a crossed bone . 
' Are they doctors ? ' he asked quietly to Ron . 
' Doctors ? " Said Ron , looking startled . 
Are the Muggles cutting people off ? 
No , they are physicians . ' 
' Come here ! Mrs. Weasley cried out from the wizard in the corner , and they followed her in the line before a blonde blonde wizard sitting in front of a desk with instructions . 
The wall behind her is covered with messages and advertisements such as : A CLEAN CLEANER FOR PHARMACEUTICAL DRINKS DOES NOT BECOME ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTIBIOTIC DISEASES ARE PROHIBITED BY A MEDICINE Qualified . 
There is a large portrait of a witch with long silver hair , a portrait of : 
Dilys Derwent 
Physician of St Mungo Hospital in 1722 - 
Principal of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft in 1741 
Mrs. Dilys was glaring at the Weasley family at almost as if counting them ; When Harry caught her eye , she blinked , walked away from the portrait and disappeared . 
Meanwhile , in front of the line , a young witch is performing a jig dance in a very strange place , and is trying in the midst of painful groans to explain its condition to her . Behind the table . 
' that is ... 
Hmm ... brother shoes for grandchildren ... 
Oh ... they eat me ... 
Oops ... the legs ... look at them , there must be ... 
Ah ... something damned devil on the shoes and I can not ... 
AAAAAH ... take them out with you . " It jumped all over on one leg and swung it over the other as if it was jumping on hot coal . 
' shoes can not stop me from reading ? " the blond witch said , irritably pointing to the big sea on the left of her desk . ' I need to go to MA wounded , fourth floor . 
Just like the floor signs . 
Next ! ' 
As it wandered away from the line , the Weasley family inched forward a few steps and Harry read the sign of the floor : 
ACCIDENTS ACCORDING TO THE Ground Floor 
Cauldrons , burning wands , brushes , etc . 
TRIBUTES FROM BIRDS IN THE FIRST FLOOR 
Bites , burns , burns , thorns , etc . 
SPECIAL FEATURED BIRDS 2 nd floor 
Contagious diseases , such as acne , diarrhea , scrojungulus , etc . 
PHARMACEUTICALS AND PLANTS The third floor 
Redness , vomiting , loss of control , etc . 
MAJOR TREATMENT OF THE ROAD 
Curse can not be solved , magical spell , misapplication mantra , etc . 
COFFEE DRINK FOR VISITORS / STORES Floor 5 th 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE THE NEXT PLACE , DO NOT REPRESENT OR MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE BEEN , THERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ? 
An old witch with a headset standing at the top of the line was now walking toward the reception desk . ' I want to meet Broderick Bode ! he said while wheezing 
' Room 49 , but I'm afraid you're just wasting your time , ' the witch said roughly . ' He was totally confused , he knew - he still thought he was a teapot . 
Next ! ' 
A sorcerer with a sly look took a small girl by the grip of her ankles as she flapped wings at his head , a pair of huge wings , covered with fur that protruded from behind her . 
' Fourth floor , ' said the witch , bored without asking , and the man disappeared through the double door next to the table , still holding her daughter in a strange shape . . ' Next ! ' 
Mrs. Weasley moved to the table . 
' Hello , ' she said , ' my husband , Arthur Weasley , seems to have been moved to another room this morning , could you tell us ... ? ' 
' Arthur Weasley ? " said the sorcerer , dragging his finger under a long list of items in front of him . ' Right , first floor , second door , Dai Llewellyn's Room . ' 
' Thanks , ' Mrs. Weasley said . ' Let's go , everyone . ' 
Everyone followed her through the double door and walked down the narrow corridor with portraits of well - known doctors illuminated by candles in crystal lamps hanging from the ceiling that looked like huge soap bubbles . 
There were many witches and wizards in their blue robes - yellow out through the door they had just passed ; a yellow gas stained the path as they passed through a door , and now they heard the cry coming from all sides . 
They rushed up a staircase and entered the corridor called The Traumatic Trash , where , on the second door read : ' Dangerous ' Dai Llewellyn Room : weight . 
Just below that line , there is a business card in a bronze brass desk , with handwritten text : The main physician : Hippocrates Smethwyck . 
Trainee : Augustus Pye . 
' We will wait outside , you Eyes crazy , ' Miss Tonks said . ' Arthur does not want to have too many people visit a moment does not prioritize the family before . ' 
The mad - eyed teacher grimaced and leaned back against the wall of the corridor , his master's eyes flashing in all directions . 
Harry also stepped back , but Mrs. Weasley raised her hand through the door and said , ' Do not be silly , Harry , Arthur would like to thank you . ' 
The room is small and gray , while the only window is narrow and lying high on the wall opposite the door . 
Much of the light emanating from the crystal lamps hangs between the ceiling . 
The walls are covered with oak and there is a portrait of a wicked witch hanging on the wall below it : Urquhart Rackharrow , 
1612 - 1697 , the invention of the word Entrail - expellin g ( Prolific Gesture - perhaps to avoid surgery ? ) . 
There are only three patients in it . 
Mr. Weasley occupied the bed at the end of the room , next to the tiny window . 
Harry rejoiced and watched as he was leaning against the pillows and reading the Daily Prophet under the rays of the sun falling on his bed . 
He looked up and blushed as they walked towards him . 
' Hi everybody ! he sighed loudly and threw the newspaper across the side . ' Bill just walked away , Molly , he had to go back to work , but he said he was going to see you later . ' 
' How do you feel , Arthur ? Mrs. Weasley asked while bending over to kiss Mr. Weasley's cheek and anxiously looking at his face . ' He is still very weak . ' 
' You feel perfectly well , ' said Mr. Weasley radiant , raising his well - rounded arm to hug Ginny . ' If they can remove the tape , you're perfectly fine to go home . ' 
' Why can not they remove the tape , Dad ? ' Fred asked . 
' Well , I was bleeding like crazy whenever they tried , ' said Mr Weasley cheerfully , raising his hand with his wand lying on the bedside table , waving and six more chairs appearing next to him . His bed and all sat down . ' It looks like the snake's canine teeth have an unusual type of poison that causes the wound to open . 
They will definitely find the antidote ; They said that they had received so much worse than this , and in the meantime , every hour they had to take blood medicine . 
But the one over there , ' he lowered his voice and nodded toward the opposite bed , where a pale and sick man was staring at the ceiling . " Being bitten by a Wolf Wolf , poor . 
Can not cure . ' 
' A Wolf Chemist ? Mrs. Weasley whispered , looking wary . ' Is he dangerous in the public area ? Should he be in his own room ? ' 
' There are still two weeks until the moon is full , ' said Mr. Weasley quietly . 
People talked to him this morning , the doctors trying to convince him that he could return to a normal life . 
I told him without name - of course - that I knew there was a Wolf Wolf , a very cute man who had found a very good way to overcome it . ' 
' What did he say ? ' George asked . 
' Say he ' ll bite you if you do not go , ' said Mr. Weasley sadly . ' And the woman over there , ' he pointed out , the only person remaining in the bed at the door , ' refusing to tell the healer what bite her , that made us think She must have done something wrong . 
Whatever it is , it bites her a pretty bad piece on her leg , it smells disgusting when they remove the tape . ' 
' So what will happen to us , Daddy ? ' Fred asked and pulled the chair closer to the bed . 
' You already know what , right ? " Mr. Weasley said with a meaningful smile on Harry's face . ' It was so simple - Daddy had a long day , drowned , got up and got bitten . ' 
' Did the prophet say that he was attacked ? ' Fred asked and pointed to the newspaper that Mr. Weasley had left beside . 
' No , of course not , ' said Mr. Weasley with a slightly sour smile , ' I do not want people to know there's a big and dirty snake attacking ... ' 
' Brother Arthur ! ' Mrs Weasley warned . 
' ... attacking ... eh ... three , ' said Mr. Weasley hurriedly , though Harry could be sure it was not his intention . 
Where are the three when things happen ? ' George asked . 
' That's my job , ' said Mr. Weasley , still laughing . 
He picked up the Prophet's Diary and opened it again , " I just read that Willy Widdershins was arrested before everyone came here . 
Do you know that Willy is suspected to be standing behind the last summer's water sprays ? 
One of them caught fire , the toilet exploded and people found him unconscious , from head to toe covered with fragments ... ' 
' When Daddy said he was " on duty , " ' Fred came in with a low voice , ' what are you doing ? ' 
' I heard you talking , ' Mrs. Weasley whispered , ' we do not discuss those issues here ! 
Talk about Willy Widdershins to Arthur . ' 
' Do not ask me any way , but he really got out of the toilet , ' said Mr. Weasley . ' I can only guess that gold has changed everything ... ' 
' You're protecting it , are not you ? ' George quietly said . 
That weapon ? 
What - Who - knows - who - is - looking ? ' 
' George , be quiet ! ' Mrs Weasley . 
' Anyway , ' Mr Weasley said in a higher voice , ' this time Willy is caught red - handed , but the door knob bites the Muggles but he does not think he can get out of the case because the post The Muggles lost their fingers and now are in St Mungo Hospital for emergency bone reconstruction and memory correction . 
Let's think , the Muggles are in St Mungo ! 
He wondered where they were ? ' 
And he glanced around as if hoping to see a sign . 
' I did not say Who - who - knows - who - was there a snake that Harry ? ' Fred asked and looked and three to probe response . ' A big snake ? 
I saw the night he came back , right ? ' 
' That's enough , ' Mrs. Weasley interrupted . ' Brother Eyes crazy and Miss Tonks hang out , Arthur , they come to see you . 
And wait outside , ' she added to the kids and Harry . ' You can go to goodbye later . let's go . ' 
They went back to the corridor . 
Mad Professor Eyes and Miss Tonks walked in and closed the door behind them . 
Fred raised an eyebrow . 
' Very good , ' he said calmly and rummaged in his pockets of clothes , ' this is it . Do not say anything else . ' 
' Did you find this ? ' George said and pulled out something that looked like a human skin . 
' I read your mind , ' Fred said and grinned . ' to see St Mungo's hospital have a spell blocking the door ? ' 
He and George unfastened the rope and separated the five extended ears from each other . 
Fred and George raised them up . 
Harry hesitates not to hold . 
' Come on , Harry , take it ! 
I saved my life . 
If anyone has the right to eavesdrop , then that is me . ' 
Grinning unwillingly , Harry took one end of the string and inserted it in his ears to imitate the twins . 
' OK , let's go ! ' Fred whispered . 
The strands of human skin twisted and wandered like worms and long , through the door . At first , Harry did not hear anything , then jumped up when he heard Tonks whisper as clearly as she stood next to him . 
' They searched the whole area but could not find the snake anywhere . 
It seems that it disappeared after attacking Arthur but who - who - also - knows - who can not hope to use a snake to break into ? ' 
' I suppose he's got that snake in to spy on , ' Moody snarled , ' because he can not get lucky , is he ? 
No , I suppose he is trying to get a better picture of what he is facing and if Arthur is not there , he will have more time to look around . 
So Potter said he saw all that happen ? ' 
' Yes , ' said Mrs. Weasley . 
She said it seemed difficult . ' Everybody knows , Dumbledore seems to expect Harry to see something like that . ' 
' Well , yes , ' said Moody , ' there is something very strange about Potter , we all know that . ' 
' Dumbledore looked worried about Harry when I talked to him this morning , ' Mrs. Weasley whispered . 
' Of course you have to worry , ' said Mr. Moody . ' He saw everything through the Who - Who - Know - Who's snake eyes . 
Obviously , Potter does not realize what that means , but if Who - who - knows - who - is - he owns the boy ... ' 
Harry removed the extended Ears , his heart beating very fast and the heat was pouring on his face . 
He looked at the others . 
They are staring at it , the ropes still lingering on their ears , they look so horrible . 
Chapter 23 : CHRISTMAS IN THE ROOM 
Is this the reason why Dumbledore does not look in Harry's eyes ? 
Do you think Voldemort is watching them , fearing that their bright youths might turn red , with scratches like cat scratches ? 
Harry still remembered how Voldemort's snake face escaped behind Professor Quirrel's head and tied his arm behind his back , wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort had escaped from his body . 
He felt dirty , impure , like he was holding on to his germ of death , feeling inadequate to sit on the subway back from the hospital with pure , innocent people . , but neither soul nor body is bound by Voldemort's uncleanness . It not only sees the snake , it is the serpent , it now knows it . 
A terrible thought , very faintly flashed in his head , a memory floating in consciousness , thought had deepened his mind rolling , writhing like real snakes . 
Besides focusing on the hands and feet , is he still doing g ? 
Things that he could only do in a sneaky manner like a weapon that he had not used before 
I was the weapon , Harry thought , and the thought was like a poison pumped into his veins , causing it to clutter , causing it to sweat as he sat on the electric car wobbling through the dark tunnel . . 
I'm what Voldemort is trying to use , that's why they give the guard around him wherever they are , it's not protecting him , but to protect others , only one place . They could not protect us , they could not let anyone keep their eyes on me all day at Hogwarts . I attacked Uncle Weasley last night , it was Voldemort who made me do it , and now he has . I am in my body , listening to my thoughts 
Are you Harry ? Mrs. Weasley whispered , reaching over to Ginny to tell her while the electric car was still wobbling in the dark . You do not look very well . 
Do you feel tired ? 
Everyone looks at it . 
Harry shook his head and looked at the brochure about family insurance . 
Harry , are you sure you're fine ? Mrs. Weasley said in a worried voice as they passed the weed - filled wasteland between Grimmauld Place . You look so pale too This morning did you sleep ? I went upstairs and rested for a few hours before dinner , okay ? 
Harry nodded . This is probably a reason to be prepared not to talk to anyone else , the reason it really is , so when she opened the door she rushed straight in , crossing the price . Yeah , upstairs , into his bedroom and Ron . 
There , it began to move , between Phineas Nigellus ' empty beds and the empty picture , filled with questions and even crazy thoughts in his mind . 
How could it turn into a snake ? 
Could it be a zoologist , he could have known that maybe Voldemort was a proper beast , Harry thought , it seemed reasonable , of course he had turned into a snake . And as he manipulates himself , the two mutate still can not explain how he can get to London and get back in bed for five minutes but Voldemort is now the most powerful witch in the world , Dumbledore , it is very likely that he moves so easily . 
And then , with a throbbing pain , he thought , but this was crazy , if Voldemort was controlling me , I was giving him a great view of the Brotherhood of the Phoenix Brotherhood . gay now ! 
He would know who was in the organization and where Sirius was and heard so many things he was not supposed to , everything Sirius had told him about the first time I was here . 
There is only one way to solve it : it must leave Grimmauld Place immediately . 
He will enjoy all the Christmas in Hogwarts without the others , at least to keep them safe during the holidays but no , that's not possible , yet many people in Hogwarts may be injured . 
What if next time it's Seamus or Neville ? 
He paused and stared at the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus . 
A heavy sensation is settling down at the end of the stomach . 
It has no other choice . 
It will have to return to Privet Drive , completely secluded from other witches . 
Well , if it had to go , then there's no reason to be vicious here . 
Do your best not to think of how the Dursleys will cry when they see it at their doorstep six months earlier than they think it's coming to their chest , shoving the lid shut and locking , then He looked around for the Hedwig before realizing that it was still at Hogwarts - well , that was less of a thing to wear - it held one end of the chest and halfway to the door as the voice Are you running away ? 
He looked around . 
Phineas Nigellus was back on the portrait and leaned against the picture frame , watching Harry with an amused expression . 
No need to run away , Harry said short , pulling his chest a few more feet through the room . 
( Foot is 31 cm , feet is plural of foot ) 
I think , Phineas Nigellus stroked his beard , to belong to the Gryffindor home he must be brave ! 
You are showing us that you are better off to belong to my home . 
Slytherin we are brave , yes , but not stupid . 
For example , if we had to choose , we would always choose to secure our head . 
Not that I was protecting my head , Harry said shortened , tugging the chest through the particularly rugged floor , an old rug in front of the door . 
Well , I see , Phineas Nigellus said , still bearded , this is not a dirty run - he is so admirable . 
Harry ignored him . 
His hand was holding the doorknob , Phineas Nigellus said sluggishly , I have a message for him from Albus Dumbledore . 
Harry turned around . 
what is that ? 
Stay there . 
I have moved ! Harry said , his hand still on the door knob . What is the notice ? 
I gave it to him anyway , huh , Phineas Nigellus said gently . Dumbledore says ' stay there ' 
Why ? Harry said impatiently , releasing his hand from the chest . Why did he want me to stay here ? 
Did he say anything else ? 
He did not say anything , Phineas Nigellus said , lifting his thin black eyebrows as if he felt Harry was very confused . 
Harry's mood flared like a snake launching off a long grass . 
It was exhausted , it was embarrassed in the vast space , it was faced with horror , then peace , and again scared again in the last 12 hours , and Dumbledore still do not want to say What with it ! 
That's the message , is not it ? it says loudly . 
' Stay there ' ! That is all that one can command me after I was attacked by the Dementors ! 
Be there for the adults to settle things , Harry ! 
We will not tell you everything , because your little brain will probably not be able to cope with it ! 
You know , Phineas Nigellus says , even bigger than Harry is exactly the reason I hate being a teacher ! 
Young people are always convinced that they are absolutely correct about everything . 
Had that not come out clearly in front of you , that poor , pugnacious man , that there must be a good reason that the Rector of Hogwarts did not disclose every detail in his plan for you ? 
Have you ever stopped thinking that you are being treated so badly , to notice that following Dumbledore's instructions has never caused you any harm ? 
Are not . 
No , like all the other kids , he was absolutely sure that he was lonely thinking and endured alone , he realized danger alone , he was the only one smart enough to recognize God . What are the plans ? 
He is planning to do something with me right ? Said Harry immediately . 
Did you say that ? Phineas Nigellus said , lazily ruffling his silk gloves . Now , if you forgive me , I have other more important things to do than to hear the pain of the children wish you a good day . 
Then he walked over the edge of the picture frame and disappeared . 
The picture is still empty . 
Anger , Harry pulled his chest back to the foot of the bed and threw himself face down on the old bed sheet , his eyes closed , his body heaving and aching . 
It felt like it was going to be a long , hard - to - believe journey less than 24 hours before Cho Chang came close to her under the mistletoe . It was so tired that she was afraid to sleep but she did not know it . How to tolerate that for how long Dumbledore told him to stay in it means he was allowed to sleep but he feared what would happen if he did it again ? 
It is falling into the dark 
It's all like a movie in the beginning it's just waiting to start . 
He was walking along a quiet corridor toward a simple black door , passing through rough stone walls , torches and an open door to the stone steps leading down to the lower level . left 
It came to the black door but could not open it it staring at it , desperately what it eagerly wanted with all my heart was beyond the reach of the wish beyond its dream price His scar is aching at the time it can think more smoothly 
Harry , Ron's voice , far away , Mom said dinner was over , but she would leave it to him if he wanted to rest . 
Harry opened his eyes , but Ron left the room . 
She does not want to be alone with her , Harry thought . 
Not after what he heard Moddy say . 
It is assumed that no one wants it to stay there , now they know what is in it . 
It does not come down to dinner , it does not want to impose its presence on people . 
She turned away , and a moment later , she fell asleep . 
He woke up very early , in the early morning , his stomach ached from hunger and Ron was snoring evenly in the bedside . 
Looking around the room , he saw Phineas Nigellus's black - and - white silhouette return to his painting , and this meant that Dumbledore would be able to take Phineas Nigellus to look after it , in case he attacked . other one . 
The feeling of not being clean again resurfaces . Sometimes he wished that he had not followed Dumbledore ... if this was the way life went to him when he was staying at Grimmauld Place from now on , in the end it might have been better off . at Privet Drive . 
Everyone else would spend the next morning decorating the house for Christmas . 
Harry could not remember whether Sirius had been in a happy mood before ; He really is singing happy songs , it seems like he is happy that he has friends around for Christmas . 
Harry could hear his voice through the floor in the cold living room as he sat alone , looking out the white sky outside the window , the heavy snow falling , wildly that it gives people the opportunity to talk to each other about it , like they have to do it . 
When he heard Mrs. Weasley call her name lightly at lunchtime , she pulled farther up the stairs and ignored it . 
About six o ' clock in the evening , the doorbell rang and Mrs. Black started screaming again . 
Given that Mundungus or some other member of the Brotherhood came to call , Harry just adjusted his position for comfort , leaning against the wall of the living Buckbeak room , where it was hiding , trying to forget the hunger . scratching it when he fed his son the rat died . 
A few minutes later , someone banged on the door and it was startling . 
I know you're here , Hermione's voice . Can you go out ? 
I want to talk to you . 
What the hell are you doing here ? Harry asked the girl , opening the door as Buckbeak searched for the debris of the dead rats on the straw - covered floor that could have fallen off . I think you are skiing with your parents ? 
Well , to be honest , skiing is not really my job , says Hermione . So come here for Christmas . There was snow on her hair and her face was bleeding from the cold . But do not tell Ron . 
I told him that skiing was really fun because he kept smiling . 
Dad and Mom have a little disagreement , but I tell them that those who are anxious about the test stay at Hogwarts to learn . 
They want to do well , they will understand . 
No matter what , she said vigorously , go to his bedroom , Ron's mother burned the fireplace there and he sent some sandwiches . 
Harry followed her down to the second floor . 
As it entered the bedroom , it was quite a surprise to see both Ron and Ginny waiting , sitting on Ron's bed . 
I came here with a Coach Bus , Hermione said gently , took off her jacket before Harry had time to say . Dumbledore had told me what was going on in the morning , but I had to wait until the end of the program to leave . 
Umbridge was irritated to see that all of them had disappeared in her nose , even though Dumbledore had even told her that Dr . Weasley was at St Mungo's and she allowed all of you to come . visit . 
So that ... 
She sat down next to Ginny , and the two girls with Ron looked straight at Harry . 
How do you feel ? Asked Hermione . 
I'm fine , Harry says harshly . 
Oh , do not lie , Harry , she was impatient . Ron and Ginny said that he had been avoiding everyone since he had returned from St Mungo . 
Did they say that ? Said Harry , glaring at Ron and Ginny . 
Ron looked down at his feet , but Ginny seemed completely unconcerned . 
yes , he was like that ! she said . 
And he will not look at anyone anymore ! 
It's not that everyone will look at me ! Harry was angry . 
Maybe he thought about it again , and made him think that people did not look at him , Hermione suggested , her mouth twitching . 
Funny , Harry , turning away . 
Well , do not make more misunderstandings , Hermione said sharply . See , people have told me about what he was listening to last night with the Long Ears 
So what ? Harry grumbled , putting his hands deep into his pocket as he watched the snow grow thicker on the outside . They all talk about me , right ? Well , I'm getting used to that . 
We want to talk to you , Harry , Ginny says , but he's been hiding since we're here . 
I do not want anyone to talk to me , Harry says , getting angry more and more . 
Okay , you're a bit stupid , Ginny is angry , maybe I do not know that I'm the one who was being manipulated by Know - Who , and I can tell I know how you feel . 
Harry remained silent as the effect of these words gradually defeated him . 
Then it turns its head around . 
He forgot , he said . 
Good luck to you , Ginny cool . 
I'm sorry Harry said , and he wanted to say . 
So ... do you think you're being manipulated ? 
To see , do you remember all that you do ? Asked Ginny . Are there any long time that you do not know what you are doing ? 
Harry rummaged in his memory . 
No , it says . 
Then that Know - Who - Who never occupied him , Ginny said simply . When he did it for me , I could not remember what he had done for many hours . 
I found myself somewhere and did not know how to get there . 
Harry did not dare to believe her , but his heart flashed almost in spite of himself . 
That dream is about my dad and that snake , though - - 
Harry , you've had such dreams before , Hermione said . You've got pictures of what Voldemort has planned since last year . 
That's another story , Harry shook his head . I was in the snake . It's like I'm a snake ... what would happen if Voldemort somehow took me to London - - ? 
One day , Hermione was really upset , he would have to read Hogwarts : A History , and maybe it would show him that it did not show up and disappear in Hogwarts . 
Even Voldemort could not make him fly out of his bedroom , Harry . 
You never leave your bed , dear friend , Ron said . I see you kick in sleep for at least a minute before we can wake you up . 
Harry started walking back and forth in the room , thinking . 
What they say is not just for comfort . It's also very sensible ... not to think much , it took a sandwich from the plate on the bed to drown in the mouth . 
Finally I'm not a weapon , Harry thought . 
Her heart was filled with happiness and comfort , and it felt like she was really into everyone when they heard Sirius walk through the door to enter Buckbeak's room , sing God Rest Ye , Merry Hippogriffs to the highest can 
How could it ever wish to return to Privet Drive for Christmas ? 
Sirius's joy for the house was so crowded as before , and especially Harry had turned around , so easily spread to others . 
You are no longer a mournful owner like last summer , now you seem to have determined that people should enjoy the holidays together , if the holiday is not happier than what is at Hogwarts , and he Working tirelessly to prepare for Christmas , cleaning up and decorating with the help of the children , so that when they go to bed at Christmas Eve , the house is almost unrecognizable . 
The dull chandelier was no longer full of spider webs but now covered with wreaths of hummingbirds and long , gold , silver flags ; The magic snow falls shimmeringly on the carpet ; a huge Christmas tree that Mundungus earned , decorated with real fairies , obscured Sirius's pedigree tree , and even the stuffed elk on the wall of the hall was worn . beard and Santa Claus hat . 
Harry woke up in the morning of Noel to open the presents at the foot of his bed and Ron opened half of his seemingly larger presents . 
This year the real income , it informed Harry through a bunch of paper flipped . Thank you for the Spirit Bowl , it was great , eating off Hermione's gift - she gave herself a homework plan . . 
Harry rearranges his presents and finds a gift with Hermione's handwriting on it . 
She also gave him a diary like a diary , except for the fact that whenever she opened a page , she bellowed something like : Do it today or you will pay ! 
Sirius and Lupine gave Harry a superb book entitled , " Defense of the Magic of Defense , " and its application against the Dark Arts , with vivid illustrations for the Spellcasters and Ghosts . The technique is described in it . 
Harry eagerly pulled out the first book and it immediately became apparent that it was very useful for DA's upcoming project . 
Uncle Hagrid sent a brown leather wallet with fangs , probably a way to prevent theft , but unfortunately Harry could not insert money and his fingers were not bitten off . 
Her gift Tonks is a small model of Lightning , which can work , as Harry watches it fly around the room , expecting it to still have a normal sized broom ( lightning is a broom ) . God , can accelerate from 0 to 150 miles per hour in 10 seconds - ND ) ; Ron gave him a bag of lentils , Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's still a regular knit sweater and some patties , and Dobby's gift was one . It's really bad that Harry suspected it was painted by the elf . 
It had to upset the picture from head to toe , and it was nicer when , with a loud crack , Fred and George moved to the bottom of his bed . 
Good Christmas , George said . Do not go downstairs at this time . 
Why not ? Said Ron . 
Mother cried again , Freg said heavy . Percy sent back his sweater . 
Without an explanation , George added . Do not ask about your father , or talk about visiting your father , or something like that . 
You tried to comfort your mother , Fred said , walking around the bed to see Harry's painting . Tell Mom that Percy is nothing better than a pile of rat droppings . 
Not effective , George said , reaching for a Chocolate Frog Candy . So Lupine replaced it . 
It's best to let him cheer me up before we go down for breakfast , he thought , 
What could this be ? Fred asked , glancing at Dobby's picture . Just like a chimpanzee with dark eyes . 
that's Harry ! George said , pointing to the back of the painting , behind the writing . 
Frankly , Fred grinned . 
Harry threw his diary - his - home - on - his - house ; It hits the wall opposite and falls to the floor , happily humming : If you hit enough dots on the i and draw enough horizontal lines of the letter t then you can do anything . you want ! 
They got up and changed . 
They can hear the people in the house saying Merry Christmas to each other . 
On the way down the stairs they meet Hermione . 
Thanks for the book , Harry said happily . I wanted to have the theory of arithmetic 
That's a long time ago ! 
And that perfume is not normal Ron . 
That's fine , Ron said . Who is it for ? she added , nodding toward the neatly folded gift she was holding . 
Kreacher , Hermione said cheerfully . 
Do not give it your clothes ! Ron warned her . You know what Sirius said : Kreacher knows too much , we can not free it ! 
This is not the clothes , Hermione said , though if I had my own way to give him something to wear , instead of the old tattered piece of cloth . 
No , this is just an old blanket you sew . I think it will make his bedroom brighter . 
What bedroom ? Harry asked , lowering his voice to the point of whispering as they passed the portrait of Sirius ' mother . 
Sirius said it was not a bedroom , rather a small shack , said Hermione . It seemed as if he was sleeping under the boiler in the kitchen cabinet . 
Mrs. Weasley was the only one in the basement when they arrived . 
She was standing in front of the fireplace , her voice like she had a bad cold when she wished the Merry Christmas kids , and they looked away . 
Is this Kreacher's bedroom ? Said Ron , stepping over to a dirty door in the corner opposite the dining room . 
Harry never saw it open . 
Oh , Hermione said , sounding a bit nervous . 
Oh ... I think we should knock on the door . 
Ron knocked on the door but did not respond . 
He could be upstairs , he said , and it was not difficult , pulling the door open . Urgh ! 
Harry peeked in . 
The crockery was almost crushed by a huge pot boiler , but at the end of the space under the steam pipes , Kreacher made it look like a bird's nest . 
A mess of rags of all kinds and old smelly blankets was piled on the floor and a small hollow in the middle said where Kreacher was sleeping every night . Here in the middle of the cloth are moldy breadcrumbs and rancid slices of cheese . In a corner of the room there are sparkling objects and coins that Harry thinks Kreacher has kept , like a wicked bird , while Sirius cleans his house , and also finds photographs of him . The family had silver frames that Sirius threw away in the summer . 
Their broken glass was still visible , but the small figures in the black - and - white image were looking at it haughty , including - it felt a slight shock in the belly - a black woman The heavy expression on her trial was witnessed in Dumbledore's Sign : Bellatrix Lestrange . 
As far as its appearance , her photos are most liked by Kreacher ; The picture is placed in front of all the other pictures and the glass is clumsy attached with the charm . 
I thought I would leave him a present here , Hermione said , putting the neat package in the middle of the dents of the rags and blankets , and closing the door gently . He will find it later , will be fine . 
Think about it , Sirius appeared from the pantry holding a large turkey as the kids closed the door , recently did anyone actually see Kreacher ? 
I did not see it from the night we came back , Harry said . He ordered it out of the kitchen . 
Oh , Sirius thought . You know , that was the last time he saw it ... it might have been hiding somewhere upstairs . 
It can not leave , right ? Said Harry . I mean , when he says ' out ' , maybe he thinks he wants it out of the house ? 
No , the elves must not leave unless they get dressed . 
They were tied to the family's home , Sirius said . 
They could leave if they really wanted to , Harry refuted . Dobby did that , leaving Malfoy to give him a warning two years ago . 
He had to punish himself later , but it still did . 
Sirius was a little confused for a moment , and said , " Look for it later , I hope to find it on the crouching bed in front of my mother's pants or something else . 
Sure enough , maybe it was crawling into the closet that was spraying and dying ... ( The cabinet was placed on the boiler , but it was not set so high . 
Fred , George and Ron both laughed ; although Hermione was very reproachful . 
While eating lunch in Noel , the Weasleys , Harry and Hermione planned to visit Mr. Weasley again , accompanied by Mad - Eye and Lupine . 
Mundungus appeared at the time when people ate pudding and cream cakes , thanks to borrowing a car for the occasion , as the subway did not work during Christmas . 
The car , which Harry suspected was stolen with the approval of the owner , was expanded by the mantra that was once recited in the Weasley old Ford Anglia . 
Even with the usual size , ten people with a Mundungus driver can still fit in a perfectly comfortable car . 
Mrs. Weasley hesitated before entering the car - Harry knew her disagreement with Mundungus was struggling with her dislike of traveling without magic - but , finally , the cold outside with the plea of The kids won , and she dropped into a back seat , between Fred and Bill with a comfortable mood . 
Trip to St Mungo Hospital takes very little time because there are almost no vehicles on the road . 
Small groups of sorcerers are sneaky , gradually going to another quiet street to enter the hospital . 
Harry and the others got out of the car , and Mundungus drove to the corner to wait for them . 
They walked casually toward the window with a standing plastic mannequin , then , one by one , stepped through the glass . 
The reception area looks very much like the holiday : the St Mungo glass sphere is red and gold , becoming more colorful and colorful with Christmas decorations ; the hummingbirds are hung at each door ; and the bright Christmas trees covered with magic snow and glittering poles at each corner , each with a glittering golden star on top . 
At this time , the hospital was not as crowded as they had been before , although in the middle of the room Harry was pushed aside by a witch who had a stuck in her left nostril . 
Family harmony ? The blonde witch laughed behind the table . You are the third person I met today ... 
Magic wounded , fourth floor . 
They saw Mr. Weasley leaning against the wall of the bed , with the rest of the turkey lying in his lap and a slightly embarrassed expression . 
One thing is fine , Arthur ? Mrs. Weasley asked , after all the congratulations and gifts for him . 
Good , good , Mr. Weasley said , a bit too warm . I have not met Mr. Lang Smethwyck yet ? 
No , Mrs. Weasley looks suspicious , so what ? 
Nothing , nothing , Mr. Weasley said relieved , began to open his pile of presents . Why are people still happy ? 
What have you been given in Christmas ? Oh - Harry - this is awesome ! He had just opened Harry's fruit , a weld and screwdrivers . 
Mrs. Weasley was not entirely content with Mr. Weasley's answer . 
When her husband reached out to shake Harry's hand , she peered into the white ribbon inside his nightgown . 
Arthur Arthur , she said , with a voice in the voice like a mouse trap , he changed the tape . 
Why do you have to change the ice soon one day Arthur ? 
They told me that they would not have to change until tomorrow . 
What ? Mr. Weasley looked frightened and pulled the sheets up to his chest . No , no - nothing - it's just - 
He seemed depressed at Mrs. Weasley's sharp look . 
Well - do not get angry with Molly , but Augustus Pye has an idea ... he is Master Lang , you know , a guy who's so easy to get around and loves ... 
Um ... I mean , some Muggle healing ... they're called stitches , Molly , and they work very well to heal Muggle wounds . - 
Mrs. Weasley made a sound that seemed somewhere between the hiss and the roar . 
Lupine stepped out of bed and walked towards the Wolf , an uninhabited patient who was staring coyly at the crowd around Mr. Weasley ; Bill whispered something about getting a cup of tea , and Fred and George jumped up to him , grinning . 
Did I want to tell you , her tone grew louder and she did not seem to notice that those who accompanied her were seeking shelter , that he was croaking with the Muggle stuff ? 
Is not that crappy baby , Mr. Weasley begged , that's just - that's what Pye and I thought we just tried , but unfortunately - well , with the kind of wounds like this , It did not work as well as we thought 
What does it mean ? 
So ... to see , I do not know if you know - what are the stitches ? 
It sounded like he was trying to sew his skin , Mrs. Weasley said with a wry smile , but even he , Arthur , should not be so stupid - 
I also want a cup of tea , Harry ran away . 
Hermione , Ron and Ginny rushed out the door with it . 
When the door closed behind the children , they heard Mrs. Weasley scream , WHAT MEANS , THAT IS A GENERAL TREND ? 
It's true , Ginny shook her head as they started to walk down the corridor . Stitches ... you said ... 
You know , they are very effective with normal wounds , Hermione said frankly . You think that something in the snake venom has blocked them or something like that . 
I do not know where the tea room is ? 
In the fifth floor , Harry said , trying to remember the sign on the receptionist's table . 
They walked along the corridor through a series of double doors and found a narrow staircase with lots of portraits of ferocious lions . 
As they climbed over , the Lang Masters diagnosed them with strange illnesses and made terrible remedies . 
Ron was actually insulted when a medieval witch said it was obviously a bad case of Spattergroud ( apparently a smallpox , not found in the dictionary ) 
And what is that ? Ron was angry when Master Lang chased him through the six pictures , shoving all the occupants out of the way . 
It is the most severe pain in the flesh , young man , which will leave it with little pox and even worse than it is now - 
See who you say terrible ! Ron's eyes flushed . 
- The only remedy was to take the liver of a toad , tightly closed in the throat , standing naked at full moon in a container full of eel eyes - 
I'm not Spattergroud ! ( Maybe Spattergroto is smallpox ) 
But the ugly stain on his face , young man - 
it is freckles ! Ron was ravenous . Now go back to your painting and leave me alone ! 
She turned back to the others , all the while trying to keep her face serious . 
What floor ? 
I think it's the fifth floor , Hermione said . 
No , new fourth floor , Harry said , only one - 
But as it reached the top of the stairs , it suddenly stopped suddenly , staring at the small windows inside the double doors at the top of the corridor , which read : Curse HAVING INJURY . 
A man is looking at them with a nose pressed on the glass door . 
He had curly hair , bright blue eyes , and a blank smile that revealed his teeth . 
Ồ ! Said Ron , looking at the man . 
Oh my god , Hermione suddenly said panting . Professor Lockhart ! 
The former Black Children's Anti - Art teacher pushes the door forward and heads towards them , wearing a mauve - colored robe . 
Hello ! he said . 
I suppose you would ask for my autograph right ? 
Not much change ? Harry whispered to Ginny , who was laughing to her ear . 
Oh , how are you , Professor ? Said Ron , sounding blameworthy . 
It was Ron's wrench that ruined Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had to go to St Mungo right away , even though Lockhart was trying to completely erase Harry's memory . And Ron , Harry's understanding is limited . 
I am really very well , thank you ! Lockhart opened his mouth , drawing a distorted pen from his pocket . Now , how many signatures do you need ? 
I can sign it at once ! 
Er - we do not need a signature at this time , thanks , Ron said , raising his eyebrows as Harry asked , Professor , you should not wander in the hallway . 
Why do not you stay in the room ? 
The smile faded on Lockhart's face . 
After a long time staring at Harry , he said , have we met yet ? 
Er ... yes , we met , Harry said . You taught us at Hogwarts , do you remember ? 
Teach ? Lockhart repeated , seeming hesitant . I am ? 
Did I teach ? 
And immediately the smile returned on his face , which was a little confusing . 
taught you all that you know , I think so , right ? Well , what about the signatures ? 
Or will I sign a dozen , you can give to other little friends so no one is left out ! 
But right after that a head poked out the door at the end of the hallway and a voice rang out , Gilderoy , he was so wretched , he wandered away ? 
A Master Lang looks like a mommy to a glittering wreath running along the corridor , giving Harry and the others a warm smile . 
Oh , Gilderoy , it's a guest ! 
That's great , especially at Christmas ! 
Do not you know , he never had a visitor , poor boy , and I can not think of why , he is a cute little dog . 
They want to sign autographs ! Gilderoy told Master Lang , a grinning smile on his lips . They would like to ask for a bunch of signatures , without reply . 
I just hope we have enough photos ! 
Listen to this boy , Master Lang took Lockhart's hand and looked at him affectionately as if he were an early two - year - old child . The boy was very famous a few years ago ; We very much hope that the likelihood of donating his signature to others is a sign that his memory has begun to return . 
Will you go with me ? 
He was in a closed room , you know , he got out when we were carrying Christmas presents , the door was locked frequently ... not because he was dangerous ! 
But , she lowered her voice as whispered , he was dangerous for himself , god bless him ... do not know who you are , you see , lurk around and do not know how to spin Again ... it was good to see him this way . 
Er , Ron signaled unnecessarily on the front door , in fact , we just - er - 
But Lang's teacher had a hopeful smile , and Ron's murmured whisper of ' going to have a cup of tea ' dissolved into space . 
They looked at each other helplessly , and then followed Lockhart and Mrs. Lang down the corridor . 
Let's not stay too long , Ron said quietly . 
The Master slammed the wand into the door of Janus Thickey's Chamber and whispered , ' Alohomora . ' 
The door opened and she led the children inside , grasping Gilderoy's hands until she placed him in the armchair beside the bed . 
This is our long boarding room , she told Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny with a sad voice . For the long - term injuries caused by magic . 
Make sure that with strong doses and spells , with some luck , we can have good results . 
Gilderoy is apparently regaining some self - consciousness , and we've seen Bode's true progress , he seems to have regained his power of speech , although he did not say anything . Any language that we can recognize . 
Well , we have to go to Christmas gifts , you can talk freely . 
Harry looked around . 
The room appears with no signs of where it is that it really is a permanent residence for the sick in it . 
They have more personal belongings around the bed than Uncle Weasley ; The wall at Gilderoy's bedside was , for example , covered by his photographs , all smiling and waving to the newcomers . 
He signed many of those photos , with a scrawl , childish . 
As he was put down by his teacher Lang in his chair , Gilderoy pulled a pile of pictures toward him , took a brush and began to sign it in a flurry . 
You can put it in an envelope , he told Ginny , throwing the signed photos in her lap one by one when he signed it . I have not forgotten , you know , not yet , I still receive a lot of fan mail ... 
Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly ... I just hope that I know why he stops , gets a little embarrassed , then laughs and goes back to work with a new enthusiasm . I suspect it was just my handsome look ... 
A wiry , yellow - skinned witch in the opposite bed was looking up at the ceiling ; He was mumbling to himself and seemed completely oblivious to the surroundings . 
Two beds over there had a woman with a head covered entirely by feathers ; Harry still remembers a similar thing that happened to Hermione in the second year , though the accident , in her case , was not long . At the end of the room , colorful curtains were pulled out between the beds to keep patients and visitors away from others . 
Here , Agnes , the Doctor , told the woman with her furry face , giving her a small pile of Christmas presents . See , do not forget right ? 
And her son sent a joke saying it would be coming tonight , is not it ? 
Agnes barked for a few hours . 
And look , Broderick , he was given a beautiful pot and a beautiful calendar with a picture of a crucifix for each month ; Will they make things brighter ? Master Lang said , hurrying toward the muttering man , placing the ugly plant pot with the long tentacles on the bedside cabinet and hanging the calendar on the wall with her wand . And - oh , Mrs. Longbottom , are you going to leave ? 
Harry turned his head . 
The screen was pulled up from the two beds at the back of the room and the two of them went out in the middle of the bed : an old witch who looked horrible , dressed in a blue dress , old and wearing a pointed hat decorated with something unmistakable to be a stuffed vulture , and behind her , looked very depressed - Neville . 
For a moment , Harry realized who was lying on the other person's bed . 
He tried frantically , distracting everyone else so Neville could leave the room without being noticed and asked , but Ron also noticed the name ' Longbottom ' , and before Harry could stop him And he called out , Neville ! . 
Neville jumped up and crouched like a bullet that just caught it . 
We're here , Neville ! Said Ron , walking . Have you seen it ? 
Lockhart is here ! 
Who does it visit ? 
My friend Neville ? Neville's grandfather said kindly , approaching the children . 
Neville in looks like it should be anywhere else in the world except this one . 
Its heavy face gradually turned purple and it did not look at any of the children . 
Ah , yes , her grandmother said , looking at Harry and holding out his wrinkled palm . Yes , I know who you are , of course . 
Neville talked a lot about me . 
Oh - thank you , Harry shook hands . 
Neville did not look at it , but looked down at his feet , his face reddening . 
And the two of us are certainly the Weasley , and Longbottom continues , hand in hand to Ron and Ginny . I know your parents - not so much , of course - but they are good people , very good ... and you are Hermione Granger ? 
Hermione was startled by Mrs. Longbottom's name , but shook hands like the others . 
Yes , Neville told me all about him . 
Help him overcome some flaws , right ? 
He was a good kid , she said , throwing a stern look through her nose toward Neville , but it did not have the intelligence of her father , I'm sorry to say so . And she turned her head toward the two beds at the back of the room , so that the stuffed vultures on her hat swayed severely . 
What ? Ron was surprised . ( Harry wanted to step on Ron's leg , but it was a lot harder to signal when you were wearing jeans than when wearing a robe . ) Your dad was there , Neville ? 
What is this ? Ms . Longbotton said . Did you tell your parents about Neville ? 
Neville took a deep breath , looked at the ceiling and shook his head . 
Harry could not remember having felt ashamed , but he could not think of a way to save Neville out of this situation . 
Come on , there's nothing embarrassing ! Mrs. Longbottom angrily . You must be proud , Neville , be proud ! 
They never give up their health and alertness so their only son is embarrassed , you know ! 
I'm not ashamed , Neville said softly , still looking around except for Harry and the others . 
Ron was now trying to see who lay on those two beds . 
Well , I have a funny way of expressing it ! said Longbottom . My son and his wife , she turned to Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny were interrogated to lose his mind by the hands of the Who Who Know Who . 
Hermione and Ginny reached up and closed their mouths . 
Ron stopped looking at Neville's parents and felt ashamed . 
They are the gods , you know , and very much respected in the wizarding world , Mrs. Longbottom walked away . Naturally gifted , both of them , oh - oh , Alice , what do you want ? 
Neville's mother stood up at the back of the room in her pajamas . 
She had no happy face that Harry had seen in Moddy's old photo of the Brotherhood of the Phoenix at first . 
Her face was thin and tired , her eyes were too large and her hair was white , thin and looked like she was dead . 
She did not seem to want to talk , or perhaps she could not speak , but she had timid movements toward Neville , holding something in her extended arm . 
Again ? Ms . Longbottom said slightly tired . Very good , Alice child , very good - Neville , take whatever it is . 
But Neville reached out his hand , with what his mother had just dropped , a piece of Drooble's Drooble wrapping paper . 
Very nice , Mrs. Neville said with a fake cheerful voice , patted her mother's shoulders . 
But Neville said softly , Thank you mother . 
His mother staggered to the back of the room , moaning to herself . 
Neville looked at the others , his face looking challenged , as if he was challenging everyone to laugh , but Harry did not think he could find anything less fun in his life . 
We have to leave , Longbottom sighed , wearing long blue gloves . Nice to meet you . 
Neville , throwing the candy paper in the trash , my mother gave him enough candy paper to cover his bedroom . 
But as they left , Harry made sure he saw Neville secretly stuffing the candy paper into his pocket . 
The door was closed behind them . 
I never knew , Hermione said , looking like crying . 
Me too , Ron said in a slightly husky voice . 
Me too , Ginny whispered . 
They all looked at Harry . 
I know , it says mournfully . Dumbledore had told me he had vowed not to tell anyone ... that was the reason why Bellatrix Lestrange was sent to Azkaban , for making the Negative Curse for Neville's parents until they completely lost memory . 
Did Bellatrix Lestrange do it ? Hermione whispered , scared . 
The woman Kreacher kept the photo in his room ? 
There was a long , quiet time , broken by Lockhart's angry voice . 
See , I do not learn to write words to do nothing at all ! 
Chapter 24 : Occlumency 
Kreacher admits he hid in the attic . 
Sirius said he had found him there , covered by dust , no doubt to watch over the Black clan's hide in his closet . 
Although Sirius seemed pleased with this , it disturbed Harry . 
Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood in this reappearance , his bitter resolve seemed to have partially subsided , and he had succumbed to orders dutifully than usual , but Harry 
One or two times the elf was staring at him , but he was always far away when Harry realized that . 
Harry did not mention that vague suspicion with Sirius , as his joy dissipated quickly as the Christmas season was over . 
On their return to Hogwarts , he became more and more like the look Mrs. Weasley called sullen , often empty and gruff , often withdrawn to Buckbeak's room for hours . . 
The bass of the uncle penetrated the house , rusted under the door like some poison gas , so all of them are infected . 
Harry does not want to leave Sirius again when he mentions only Kreacher to be his friend ; In fact , for the first time in his life , he did not seem to want to go back to Hogwarts . 
Back in school means re - placing itself under the autobiography of Dolores Umbridge , who , without a trace of suspicion , has set up dozens of other rules while they are absent ; There is no Quidditch match to watch in the time to come when it is banned ; It is likely that the burden of homework will increase as the exam approaches or even in the near future ; and Dumbledore is still indifferent to that . 
In fact , without the Defense League , Harry thought he had asked Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and stay in Grimmauld Place . 
And then , on the last day of the holiday , something happened , making Harry extremely afraid of his return to Hogwarts . 
Dear Harry , Mrs. Weasley said , while poking his head into his bedroom and Ron , where the two of them were playing the witch Hermione , Ginny and Crookshanks were watching , could you go down to the kitchen ? To 
Professor Snape wanted to say a few words to his son . 
Harry did not immediately recognize what she had just said ; One of its pieces is fighting in a fierce riot with Ron's good one and it is being urgently pushed . 
Crush it - crush it , its the only good one , you're stupid . 
Sorry , Uncle Weasley , what did you say ? 
Professor Snape , darling . 
In the kitchen , he had a few words . 
Harry's mouth opened in horror . 
He looked at Ron , Hermione , and Ginny , all of them gaping in front of him . 
Crookshanks , whom Hermione had kept for more than 15 minutes , happily jumped over the board and made the chess pieces go out , chirping in their highest voices . 
Snape ? 
Harry said blankly . 
Professor Snape , dear . said Mrs. Weasley . 
Come on , he said he could not stay long . 
What do you want me to do ? Said Ron annoyed as Mrs. Weasley got out of the room . You did not do anything right ? 
Are not ! , Harry said , squeezing his brain to think what he had done so that Snape pursued it to Grimmauld Place . 
The roll of parchment paper in its recent homework may have won a T ? 
One or two minutes later , as he pushed the door into the kitchen , Sirius and Snape saw that they were both sitting in the kitchen table , staring at the enemy . 
The silence between them was really heavy in that jealousy . 
A letter was opened on the table near Sirius . 
Hem , Harry said to announce the presence of it . 
Snape looked at it in a circle , his face set in the midst of black hair and greasy shadows - 
Sit down , Potter 
You know , Sirius yelled , leaning against the back seat and talking to the ceiling , I thought I would be more pleased if he did not order here , Snape . This is my home , he noted . 
I thought to meet privately , Potter , Snape said with a cold smile often bent on his lips , but Black - 
I'm his godfather , Sirius said in a louder voice . 
I was following Dumbledore's orders , Snape said , his voice , conversely , had become a bit more sour , but of course that was still there , Black , I knew he liked to look at everything . work . 
what does that mean Sirius asked as he pushed the four legs of the chair back , causing a loud crash . 
It's just that I am sure that you must feel good , discouraged that in fact you can not do anything useful , Snape has shown a very subtle emphasis on that statement , for the Society . 
That made Sirius's face flush . 
Snape's lips twisted with triumph and he turned to Harry . 
The headmaster sent me to tell him , Potter , that he wanted to take the Occlumency course . 
Harry asked blankly : What learning ? 
Snape's cold smile became clearer . 
Occlumency , Potter . 
The magic defense of the mind against the intrusion from the outside . 
A lesser known spell , but a powerful and very powerful spell . 
Harry's heart started beating very fast . 
The defense against intrusion from outside ? 
But it has not been caught , as all of them have acknowledged that . 
Why do you have to learn Occlu ? Harry blurted out . 
Because the principal said it was a good idea , Snape said softly . 
She will be studying privately once a week , but she will not say it to anyone , especially with Dolores Umbridge . 
Do you know ? 
Yes , Harry answered . And who will teach you ? 
Snape looked up . 
He said : I . 
Harry has a terrible feeling as his intestines are melting away . 
Extracurricular lessons with Mr. Snape - what did he do in this world that suffered ? 
He looked at Sirius for support . 
Why can not Dumbledore teach Harry ? Sirius asked . Why is he ? 
I think it's because of the principal's privilege to delegate this less interesting task , says sweet Snape . I assure you I did not ask for this job . He stood up . I will wait for the game at 6 pm every Monday , Potter . In my office . 
If anyone asks , just tell them that they are learning extra hours for poor students . 
Nobody in the class saw me do not need them . 
He turned away and left , his black robes billowing behind him . Wait , Sirius said , as he sat down neatly in the chair . 
Snape looked back at them mockingly . 
I'm really in a hurry , Black . 
Unlike him , I have no leisure time . 
Go on the matter , Sirius stand up . 
He was taller than Snape , and Harry realized that he had clutched his fist in the pockets of his robes and then he was sure it was the wand's handle . If I heard that you used Occlumency lessons to make it difficult for Harry , then you would have to explain to me about that . 
Touched , Mr. Snape sarcastically . But he certainly noticed that Potter was very much like his father . 
Sirius is proud to answer : yes . 
Then , he will find it so arrogant that critics can make it jump , Snape says sweetly . 
Unruly Sirius pushed the chair aside and strode towards Snape , as he pulled out the wand . 
Snape snapped 
They were determined to confront each other , Sirius angry , his teacher , Snape was calculating , he shot quickly from the tip of Sirius's wand to his eyes . 
Sirius ! Harry screamed , but Sirius did not seem to hear it . 
I warned him , Sirius said , Uncle Snape's face and face were exactly 1 foot ( ~ 33 cm ) apart . 
I did not care about Dumbledore's belief that he had changed , I was not fooled 
Well , why do not you go talk to him ? Snape whispered . Or are you afraid he might not be right when he hears the advice of a hiding place in his mother's house for six months ? 
Tell me , how was Lucius Malfoy ? 
I think he was pleased when his dog worked at Hogwarts , right ? 
The words of the dogs , Snape said softly , " Do you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized him the last time he was on a small outing ? 
A wise thought , Black , cautiously becoming himself on the platform - did not give him a hard enough excuse to leave his hiding place in the future , right ? 
Sirius raised his chopsticks . 
do not ! Harry screamed , jumped over the table and tried to stand between them . Sirius , do not ! 
Did you just call me a coward ? Sirius growled , trying to push Harry out of there , but Harry did not want to budge . 
Why , yes , I think I'm right . Said Snape . 
Harry - out - where - Sirius roared , pushing it out with the other . 
The kitchen door was open and the Weasley family , with Hermione , came in , everyone was happy , Mr. Weasley proudly walking between them with striped pajamas covered with a raincoat . 
Recovery ! He radiated notice throughout the kitchen Completely recovered ! 
He and all the other members of the Weasley family were frozen in the doorway , staring at the sight , pausing in the middle of the fight , both Sirius and Snape looking toward the door with the tree . wand just in the face 
Harry and Harry stood still , their hands stretching and trying to separate them . 
Merlin said Mr. Weasley said with a smile on his face , what's going on here ? 
Both : Sirius and Snape both lowered their wands . 
Harry observed one to the other . 
They both had an extremely contemptuous face , and the unexpected entrance of some witnesses seemed to give them this feeling . 
Snape put his wand in his pocket , turned on his heels , and hurried toward the other side of the kitchen , and did not make a comment as he passed through the Weasley family . 
He came to the door and turned around and said : At six o ' clock , every Monday night , Potter . 
And after he left , Sirius kept staring , his wand next to him . 
What happened ? Mr. Weasley asked . 
Nothing , Sir Arthur , Sirius said and panting as if he had just finished running a long distance . It's just an intimate conversation between two old school friends . As with a great effort , he laughed and said : So is he already recovered ? This is a great news , very important . 
Very true , right ? Mrs. Weasley said and led her husband to the chair . Dr . Swethwyck finally uses his magic , finding the antidote for anything similar to venom in the snake's venom , and Arthur has learned a lesson through his knowledge of medicine . study of the Muggle people , is not it , dear she added threateningly . 
Yes , dear Molly , Mr. Weasley obediently replied . 
That evening meal would be a happy meal when Mr. Weasley came back to them . 
Harry wanted to talk to Sirius and try to do something , but seeing his godfather was not too embarrassed to laugh uncomfortably at Fred and George's jokes and scooping up food for each . One person , his face looks very depressed and moody . 
Harry's Eyes are crazy and Mundungus pulls out of him when they throw in to congratulate Mr. Weasley . 
He wanted to tell Sirius and tell him not to notice what Snape said , he just teased him and that the rest of the people did not think he was a coward when he followed . Dumbledore's advice and stay at Grimmauld Place . 
However , it did not have the opportunity to do so , but merely looked at Sirius's look of discomfort , sometimes wondering if there was enough courage to mention it if it had a chance . 
Instead , it tells Ron and Hermione to learn Occlumency with Snape . 
Hermione immediately said : Dumbledore wants to end his dreams about Voldemort . 
So , you will not feel less mentally in learning them ? 
right ? 
Extracurricular lessons with Snape ? Said Ron frightenedly . 
I would rather dream nightmare than happy . 
The next day , they would return to Hogwarts with the Knights Chariot , once again escorted by Tonks and Lupine , who were eating breakfast in the kitchen as Harry , Ron and Hermione came down that morning . 
The adults seemed to whisper in the middle of the conversation , and as Harry opened the door , they all looked around and became silent . 
After breakfast in a hurry , all dressed in warm clothes and a scarf against a cold January morning . 
Harry has an uncomfortable feeling in him , he does not want to say goodbye to Sirius . 
It had a bad feeling about this breakup , it was not quite clear when they looked at each other again and it felt obligatory to say something to Sirius to prevent him from doing anything stupid . . 
Harry is worried that Snape's accusations of cowardice will offend him so much that he may be planning a few risky ventures away from Grimmauld Place . 
Before he could think what to say , Sirius called to talk to him . 
I want you to hold this . He spoke quickly and roughly in Harry's hand , wrapped in a cover of the size of a thin book . 
what is this ? Asked Harry . Remember to write to you if Snape makes you difficult . Do not open it here , " Sirius said as he carefully looked at Mrs. Weasley as she was persuading the twins to wear mittens . I think Molly will not approve of this , but I want you to use it when you need it , remember ? 
Harry replied and tucked the cover neatly into his warm pocket but knew he would never use it no matter what it was . 
It would not be possible for him , Harry , to leave Sirius to leave this safe haven even during the forthcoming Occlumency , how he had been cruelly treated by Snape . 
Come on , go , Sirius said as he patted Harry's shoulder and smiled , and before Harry could say anything else , they stood in front of the stairs , stopped in front of the chained door , The Weasley family surrounded . 
Goodbye , Harry , remember to take care . Mrs. Weasley said . 
Meet me later , Harry , and keep an eye on the serpent . Mr. Weasley said lovingly and shook hands with him . 
Yes , yes . Harry said absently , this was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful , he turned around , looked at the godfather and opened his mouth to speak , but before he could do it , Sirius took a quick hug and said curtly : Harry , remember to take care of yourself . . 
After a moment , Harry saw it turned out in the cold winter , along with Tonks ( today , dressed up as a tall woman , wearing tweed clothes with gray hair ) it stepped down . 
The door of the 12 th house slammed shut behind him . 
They followed Lupine down the stairs . 
When he came to the sidewalk , he turned to look . 
House number 12 shrank quickly , one of its two sides sliding to the side , piling the house out of sight . 
In a flash , the house was gone . 
Come on , quick , we better take the bus . Tonks said and Harry thought it was frustrating with the glance that she threw around . 
Lupine is swinging his right arm . 
PARTS 
A purple three - story bus shimmering from the thin air appeared before them , narrowly avoiding the nearest street lamp , and the light pole bounced back out of the car's path . 
A thin young man , full of acne , with his ears out in a purple uniform , jumped on the sidewalk and announced : Welcome to - 
Okay , we know , thanks . , Tonks said , Come on , come on up , 
She pushed Harry forward , up the stairs , past the driver , who rolled his eyes as Harry passed . 
Hey , this is Any - 
If you shout out his name , then you will let me try the Lure Tonks threatening to say as she moves to push Ginny and Hermione forward . 
I've long wanted to try this , Ron said happily as he joined the Harry and looked around . 
Last time , when Harry met the Cartwright in the evening and at that time the third floor was full of brass beds . 
Now , in the early morning , here is filled with a series of messy chairs and randomly rotate the window . 
Some of them seemed to have fallen as the car stopped abruptly at Grimmauld Place , some of the witches still stood and grumbled ; Shopping bags of some people slip by the car : a very messy mess of frogs , cockroaches and egg dices lying on the floor . 
Come on , we should split up . Tonks shuddered as he looked around the chairs . Fred , George and Ginny , if you can keep the chairs behind , Remus can stay quiet . 
She , Harry , Ron and Hermione advanced to the top chairs , where there were two empty chairs at the top and two at the back . 
Stan Shunpike and the driver are eagerly following Harry and Ron behind . 
With heads turning to Harry as it passed , he sat down and saw everyone jerking back and forth . 
When Harry and Ron , each giving Stan 11 Sickles , the bus departed and swayed ominously . 
The car rattled in Grimmauld Place , winding up and down the sidewalk , and another grateful sound , they were thrown back . 
Ron's chair flipped to the right and the Pigwidgeon on his lap flicked out of the cage , agitated and flew furiously forward , finally shivering and landing on Hermione's shoulders . 
And Harry , after clutching the candlestick , did not fall out of the window , they were hurrying down to what looked like a highway . 
Out there , Birmingham Stan happily said , answering Harry's unspoken questions while Ron struggled to get up from the floor . 
Can you stand it ? 
I saw your name in the newspaper this summer all the articles are full of him . 
I winked at Ern , I said , ' You have no grip when we meet you . ' Why are you doing the right thing ? ' ' 
His hands clutched their car's ticket and continued to stare at Harry , fascinated . 
It's obvious Stan does not care about how crazy some people are if they're so famous in the press . 
The tanker swayed nervously , crossing a line of vehicles from within . 
Looking ahead , Harry saw Hermione covering her eyes , and Pidwidgeon was happy to rock her shoulder . 
PARTS 
The seats collapsed after the Knights Railroad jumped from the Birmingham sidewalk to a peaceful city full of winding roads . 
The fences across the road jumped out of the way of the car as they advanced to the shore . 
From here , they came out of a bustling street in the middle of a bustling town , to a shallow causeway surrounded by hills and mountains , and then to the winds of high rise land , each with an hour hardworking . 
I changed my mind , Ron whispered the sixth time he got up from the floor . 
I never wanted to climb this thing . 
You pay attention , after this station will go to Hogwarts . Stan happily said as he was swaying in front of them . The boss was in front of them , she gave us a little to let us lined up . 
We would have Mrs. Marsh down first , so a loud noise came from the lower level , followed by a terrible noise that shot her uncomfortably . 
A few minutes later , the Knights hissed at the station stop in front of a small pub and squeezed themselves out of the way to avoid collisions . 
They could hear Stan's voice pick up Mrs Marsh down the car and breathe a sigh of relief when she hears the whispers of passengers sitting with her down to the second floor . 
The car turns the wheel , accelerates and until it hits . 
They are rolling between a snow covered Hogsmeade . 
Harry caught a glimpse of the head of the roadside pig , signs sign of ugly boar squeal creaked in the cold wind . 
Spotted snow spots on the large window above the car . 
And finally they reached the stop in front of the Hogswarts gate , Lupine and Tonks helping them carry their luggage and bye bye . 
Harry glanced up to the third floor of the bus and saw all the passengers bending down , their noses stuck to the window . 
You will be safe once in the campus , Tonks said as he carefully looked around the deserted streets . We have a good semester . 
Lupine said : Remember to take care of yourself when you shake them all and finally go to Harry . 
When the others said goodbye to Tonks , he lowered his voice : Listen , Harry , you know I do not like Snape , but he's a very good Occlumens teacher and all of us , including Sirius , I want you to learn to protect yourself , even if it is a hard work , okay ? 
Yes , yes . Harry said earnestly as he looked at his wrinkled face . See you later . 
The six of them struggled to get to the castle when they had to drag the chests . 
Before going to bed , Hermione kept mentioning the knitting needles for the elf . 
Harry glanced back as they reached the oak wood doors . The Knights ' Carriage was gone and he wanted to know what would happen tomorrow , as he had thought about this while he was still here . in the car . 
Much of the next day , Harry was exhausted as he thought about the evening . 
In the morning , in two hours of poisoning , he did nothing to dispel his worries , Snape was always annoyed . 
Its morale is less than encouraging as the members of the Defense League continue to meet it outside the classroom corridors and cheerfully ask if there are any rallies tonight . 
As long as the next meeting you will be informed in the usual way , Harry repeated , but if I can not attend tonight , I have to go , birth weak 
Do you take extra lessons for weak students ? Zacharias Smith wondered as he met Harry at the turn of the Great Hall after lunch . Oh , you must learn badly . 
Mr. Snape does not usually teach extracurricular courses , right ? 
Smith stepped quickly in a hateful outfit , and Ron glared at it . 
Do you make it sure ? 
I can get it right here , Ron said as he raised his wand and pointed to Smith's shoulder blade . 
Well , forget it , Harry said bleakly , Everybody thinks so , right ? 
Think you're stupid - 
Hi , Harry , a voice from behind it resounded . 
She turned around and saw Cho standing there . 
Oh , Harry said , his stomach crouched . Hello 
We will go to the library , Harry and Hermione resolutely said , grabbed Ron's sleeve and pulled it toward the marble stairs . 
Is Christmas fun ? May I ask you . 
OK , not bad , Harry answered . 
His vacation is quite quiet , Cho said . 
For some reason , looking at her looks more embarrassing . 
Well , have a visit to the village of Hogsmeade next month , you read the message yet ? 
Star ? 
Oh , no , I have not seen the bulletin board from school to now . 
Oh , on Valentine's Day 
That's right , Harry said and wanted to know why she told him this . I think you want - ? Of course , if you say so earnestly . 
Harry knew what he was talking about and said , " What do you think you want to know when you come to the DA meeting ? , but her response seems not to match . 
He said : I ... 
uh ... 
Oh , okay if you do not want to , she said , looking embarrassed . It's okay , so I ' ll see you later . 
She turned away . 
Harry stood there and thought hard . 
And something came to mind very well . 
For ! 
Hey ! Harry ran after and chased her up the middle of the stairs to the marble stairs . 
Oh , do you want to go to Hogsmeade on Valentine's Day with me ? 
Ohhh , fine ! she said , blushing and smiling at it . 
Oh , so decide . Harry said and felt that this day was not necessarily a complete failure , he jumped up to the library meeting Ron and Hermione before the afternoon lesson . 
At any rate , even the warmth of inviting Cho Chang to go out does not relieve the feelings of bad luck , as Harry trudged up to Snape's office . . 
He stopped in front of the door , hoping he had gone elsewhere , and then , taking a deep breath , knocking on the door and entering . 
The darkened room has many shelves placed hundreds of glass jars containing plastic resins of plants and animals , hovering in the colorful variety of poison . In a corner , a chest of drawers filled with material that once had Snape convict Harry , and not a lack of reason , stole them . 
Its attention was drawn to the front of the table , where there was a shallow basin of stone engraved around the edge with its neck and symbol , a liquid that emitted light as a candle . 
Harry noticed right away , that was Dumbledore's Sign . 
I wanted to know what was going on , but it was startled when Snape's cold voice rang out from the dark . Close the door behind the game , Potter . 
Harry followed with the sense of being confined by himself . 
When it turned in , Snape came out of the room and quietly pointed to the chair opposite his desk . 
Harry sat down while Snape's cold black eyes fixed on Harry , watching him without blinking , the harshness of his wrinkled face . 
Potter , you know why he came here , he said . 
The principal asked me to teach Occlumency . 
I just want to show my ability better in the drug . 
OK . Harry replied curtly . 
This may not be a regular classroom , Potter , Snape said as he squinted viciously , but I was still a teacher of the game and so I always had to call me teacher or professor . 
Yes teacher . Said Harry . 
Mr. Snape continued to observe it through his narrowed eyes a moment later , and said : Now , about Occlumency . 
As I told you at the godfather's kitchen , this is a kind of magic that protects the mind against intrusion and magical effects . 
And why does Professor Dumbledore think you need that , teacher ? Asked Harry , looking directly at Snape and suspected that Snape would answer him . 
Snape looked at it a moment and then said desperately : " Of course you can work right out there , Potter ? " 
The Dark Lord is proficient in Legilimency - 
What is that ? 
Sir ? 
It is the ability to draw feelings and memories from the minds of others . 
Can he read the mind ? Harry said with the worst fear . 
Potter , it was not wise , Snape said , his dark eyes lit up , I did not understand the subtle differences . That's one of the downsides to making this happen . 
Snape's teacher paused for a moment , seemingly enjoying the excitement that Harry insulted , before proceeding . 
Only the Muggles call it telepathy . 
Mind is not a book , it is used to open up and look up at free time , and it will be reviewed by any intruder . 
Mind is a complex and classy thing , Potter , to a minimum , most minds are like that . He smiled happily . It is true , however , that those skilled in Legilimency have the ability , under certain conditions , dig into the minds of their victims and understand exactly what they are looking for . 
The Dark Lord , for instance , always knows who is lying to him . 
Only Occlumency experts can repel the sensations and memories that lies and lies can lie undetected . 
No matter what Snape says , to Harry , Legilimency is very much like the extramarital powers and it does not like it at all . 
So now he knows what we are thinking ? 
Sir ? 
The Dark Lord is far away and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts School are protected by so many spells and spells that can secure the bodies and spirits of the people here . Said Snape . 
In magic there are problems of time and space , Potter . 
Direct contact with the naked eye is essential in Legilimency . 
Then , why do you have to learn Occlumency ? 
Snape looked at Harry , his long , slim fingers stroking his mouth . 
Common rules do not seem to apply to people , Potter . 
The curse that does not kill the game seems to have created a kind of link between the game and the Dark Lord . 
Evidence shows that , when the mind becomes relaxed and can be hurt , during sleep , the game participates in the thoughts and feelings of the Dark Lord . 
The headmaster thinks it is unwise to let this go on . 
He wanted me to teach how to close my mind to the Dark Lord . 
Harry's heart beat faster , faster than usual . 
But why Dumbledore wants to end it ? he asked hurriedly . 
I do not like it but it seems to be useful , right ? 
I mean ... I saw the snake attacking Uncle Weasley and if you do not see , is it sure Dumbledore can save him ? 
Sir ? 
Snape looked at Harry for a moment , continuing to stroke his mouth with his elongated fingers . 
When the teacher speaks , it seems very slow and is considered as weighing words . 
Apparently very recently , the Dark Lord was not aware of the connection between him and him . 
Until his passing emotions , sharing his thoughts , what he did not want at all . 
After all , the dreaming things just before Christmas ... 
Is that snake and Uncle Weasley ? 
Do not interrupt me , Potter , Snape said in a dangerous voice . As I said , the dreaming moments before Christmas show that there was a strong intrusion into the thoughts of the Dark Lord -- 
You see in the snake's head , not his ! 
I thought I told you not to interrupt me , Potter ? 
But Harry did not care if Snape was angry , he seemed to want to go to the back of the office ; As he walked toward the chair and as if unaware , so he sat with a very agitated , nervous expression as he held his balance while flying . 
How can you see through the snake's eyes if you are sharing Voldemort's mind ? 
Do not call the name of the Dark Lord ! Snape said . 
A vengeful silence . 
The two glared at the Chiang . 
Professor Dumbledore called his name , Harry said calmly . 
Dumbledore was a great witch , Snape whispered . Whenever he feels safe using this name , we rub his left forehead unconsciously , to where Harry knows the black sign is engraved in his skin . 
I just want to know , Harry said again , trying to be polite , why ? 
It seemed to have entered the mind of the serpent because the Dark Lord was there at specific times , Snape snarled . He was in the snake at that time so the dream saw the game is also in it , 
And Vol - did he recognize you there ? 
Probably , Snape replied coldly . 
How can you know ? Harry asked hurriedly . Just guessed by Professor Dumbledore , or - ? 
I told him , Snape said with a shrug , eyes narrowed , must call me teacher . 
Yes , Master , impatiently said , but how do you know - ? 
We know , that's enough , Snape suppressed , saying that it was important now that the Dark Lord had realized that he had access to his feelings and thoughts . 
He inferred that this process did the opposite , that is , he knew that he could approach his emotions and thoughts in the opposite direction - 
And could he try and force me to do something ? Asked Harry . are not you teacher ? , it rushes on . 
He could , Snape said with a cold and indifferent tone . So we have to use Occlumency . 
Snape's teacher pulled out his wand from his inner pocket and Harry sat straining on the chair , but Snape just put the chopsticks near his temples , in the middle of his shiny , gray hair . 
When he pulls , a silver substance appears from his temples as light and strong silk threads ; He gently used his wand to slide them into the Kuang , where the white substance was whirling , unlike liquid and gas . 
Again , he put the chopsticks on his temples and dropped the silver material into the stone pot , and without giving an explanation for this action , he carefully closed his eyes and placed it on a shelf . and turned to Harry with the wand in his hand . 
Get up and take your wand , Potter . 
Harry stood up and felt very tense . 
They faced each other through the middle table . 
You have to use your wand to try to disarm me , or to defend yourself in some way you know , Mr. Snape said . 
And what are you doing ? Harry asked and looked at the wand at Snape's hand . 
I will try to break into my mind , Snape said softly . We will see how resistance . 
I have heard that the game has proved its ability to resist the curse of Imperius . 
You will have to do the same thing to fight this one ... do your best . 
Legilimens ! 
Snape had attacked before Harry was ready , before it could begin to gather strength and resistance . 
The office is spinning in his eyes and disappearing ; Every single picture was taken from his mind like a flickering film but lively and eye - catching with what's around . 
When it was 5 years old , watching Dudley pedal a new red bike , he was about to explode with jealousy ... he was 9 years old , the bunny ripper chased him up the tree and the Dursleys were standing under the lawn . She was sitting under the Sorting Hat , and the hat told him it would be great if he got into SlytherinHermione's house in a void , her face covered in thick black hair ... hundreds of names The prisoners surrounded it around the black lake . Cho Chang was approaching it under the mistletoe .... 
Without a voice in Harry's head , at the moment of the memory of Cho Chang approaching , he did not see that , he did not see that , it was private matter . 
He felt the pain in his knees . 
Snape's office reappeared and he found it fell to the floor ; Her knees thrashed painfully at Snape's desk . 
He looked up at Snape , who lowered his wand and rubbed his wrist . 
The place was swollen , looked like a scorch . 
Are you making sorceries sore ? asked Snape , coldly . 
No , Harry bitterly answered and stood up . 
I did not see that , Snape said and meticulously looked at it . Games have put me too deep . 
Game has lost control . 
Do you see what I see ? Harry asked and doubted that he could hear the answer . 
Just blinked , Snape said , his lips curled , whose dog was that ? 
My Aunt Marge , Harry murmured , hating Snape . 
This first attempt was too bad for what he needed to show , Snape said and raised his wand again . Even if you wasted your time and energy to scream , you finally managed to stop me . 
Prevent me with your brain and you will not need a wand . 
I'm trying , Harry said angrily , but he did not show me how ! 
Many ways , Potter , dangerous Snape said . 
And now , I want to close my eyes . 
Harry gave him a malicious look before he followed . 
It was not interesting to stand there and close his eyes as Snape faced it with his wand . 
Empty your mind , Potter , you say with a cold voice . 
But Harry's anger continued to rise in his veins as venom flowed . 
Ignore the anger of it ? 
Oh , it's as easy as removing your legs ... 
You do not have to do that , Potter ... you need to be trained ... to focus on ... 
Harry tried to hollow his mind , trying not to think , or remember , or feel 
We ' ll do again - one - three - Legilimens ! 
A huge dragon was snuggling in front of the muzzle and his mother was waving to him in the fluttering glass . The Diggic lay sprawled on the ground with empty eyes watching him . 
Not ! 
Harry knelt again , his face hidden in his hands , his head aching as if someone had tried to stretch it out of his skull . 
stand up ! Snape snapped up , not trying , not trying hard . 
You have allowed me to access the memories that scared me , holding up my weapons ! 
Harry stood up , his heart pounding like he'd seen Cedric die in that cemetery . 
Snape looked pale and then angry , though his anger was far from Harry's anger . 
She was - very - tried - it gritted teeth said . 
I said that you have to pour out all the emotions ! 
Really ? 
All right , I really feel miserable , Harry growled . 
And you will find yourself the prey of the Dark Lord ! 
Snape said cruelly . 
Those who take pride in expressing their true feelings are out mad , those who can not control their emotions , those who sink into bad memories and allow themselves to be attacked easily , - in other words , the weak - they will have no chance of fighting him ! 
She would let him penetrate the mind comfortably and stupidly , Potter ! 
I'm not weak , Harry whispered , anger pounding on him so that he could attack Snape right now . 
Then prove it ! 
Take control of yourself ! Snape said . Control your anger , train your mind ! 
We will start again ! get up ! 
Legilimens ! 
He saw Uncle Vernon nailing the mail box ... hundreds of dementors gliding across the lake and heading for it ... it was going through a windowless spot with Mr. Weasley ... they were coming near the black door at the end of the corridor ... 
Harry thought it was going to pass ... but Mr. Weasley pushed it to the left , to an opening leading down the stone staircase ... 
You know ! 
You know ! 
He knelt on the floor of Mr. Snape's office , his scar as a needle stab , but the voice coming out of his mouth sounded triumphant . 
He pushed himself up and saw Snape watching him glare at the raised wand . 
It is easy to see , at this moment , that Snape had thrown the spell before Harry had managed to counterattack . 
What's going on , Potter ? he asked and looked at Harry . 
I saw - I remember , Harry gasped . 
I just remembered 
Get out ? asked Snape harshly . 
Harry did not reply right away ; It is enjoying the moment it is clearly perceived and it rubs its forehead ... 
He had dreamed of a locked door at the end of a windowless hallway for months , without realizing where it was . 
Now , looking back at these memories , he knew what he had been dreaming about so long that on August 12 he and Mr. Weasley hurried to the court of the ministry ; That corridor led to the Secretariat and that night , Mr. Weasley was attacked by Voldemort's snake in that spot . 
He looked at Snape . 
What is there in the Mystery Department ? 
What say ? Snape asked quickly and Harry was pleased to see Snape seem nervous . 
I ask , what is there in the Mystery Department , teacher ? Said Harry . 
But why , Snape said slowly , and asked again ? 
Because , Harry said , looking at him , the corridor I saw - I've been dreaming it for months now - I just realized it - it led to the Mystery Department and I thought Voldemort wanted something from the spot . that - 
I told you not to mention the Dark Lord's name ! 
They glared at each other . 
Harry's scar was irritated but he did not notice . 
Snape looked excited ; but when he spoke it sounded like he was trying to make cold and unconscious . In the Mystery Department contains a number of things , Potter , some of which will know and have nothing to do with the game . 
Did not I just tell you the simplest way ? 
Yes , Harry said as he rubbed the aching scar , now he was getting more pain . 
I want to come back here this Wednesday . 
We will continue to work . 
Turn right , Harry said . 
By all means it must leave Snape's office and go find Ron and Hermione . 
You have to get rid of all the feelings off the head every night before bed ; Make it empty , do it calmly and completely , understand ? 
Yes , Harry listened and answered . 
And I warn you , Potter ... I ' ll find out if you do not practice . 
All right , Harry muttered . 
He picked up the bag , put it on his shoulder , and hurried toward the office door . 
When he opened the door , he looked back at Snape and he did the same . 
He used the wand to draw his thoughts up from Chiang and carefully put them back into his head . 
Harry turned away without saying a word , carefully closed the door , his scar was still aching . 
He met Ron and Hermione at the library , they were doing a lot of Umbridge's recent homework . 
The others were mostly five - year - olds , sitting at the tables with lights , nibbling on the book , listening to the rustling of the gargoyles ; until the sky outside the window $ mulhoned $ a gradually black . 
Only the sound of the tiny squeal of Mrs. Pince's shoe was heard as she managed the library to wander between tables and whispered caution against the collar of the daring men . Your precious books . 
Harry felt a shudder , his scar was aching , it felt even more restless . 
As she sat down , facing Ron and Hermione , she looked at herself in the opposite window ; His face was pale and the scar appeared to be clearer than ever . 
Why ? Asked Hermione anxiously . Are you alright , Harry ? 
It's okay ... I'm fine ... I do not know yet , Harry lost his patience and grimaced when the scars hurt again . Listen ... I just realized something ... 
It recounted what it saw and reasoned . 
So ... so you say ... Ron whispered as Pince walked past and shrieked , the weapon - what - Who - who - knows - who - wants - in the Ministry of Magic ? 
In the Mystery Department , maybe so , Harry whispered . I saw the door of the third day he took me to the court on his trial and it was certainly a place with his father was danger when snake bites . 
Hermione sighed . 
is going on , she whispered . 
What is going on ? Ron asked impatiently . 
Ron , thinking of Sturgis Podmore trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic ... must be the door , this is a coincidence too then ! 
But why did Sturgis find a way to get in the way when he was on his side ? Said Ron . 
I do not know , Hermione admits It's strange 
What is there in the Mystery Department ? Harry asked Ron what he had to say about that ? 
I only know the people who work in the office called the Hispographer , Ron said thoughtfully . Because apparently no one knows exactly what they do ... probably a weird job of weapons . 
No wonder , it must have a great ability to judge , Hermione said . That's the secret that the ministry is doing , I think so . Harry , are you sure you're okay ? 
Harry placed both his arms around his forehead , though he tried to ignore it . 
I'm fine , he says , and shakes his arm shaking . I just feel a bit ... I do not like Occlumency at all . 
I understand how annoyed everyone is if the mind is attacked so many times , Hermione said sympathetically , we went down to the Common Room , where we would feel more comfortable ... 
But the Common Room was a gathering place for screams , laughter and disturbance ; Fred and George are introducing the latest junk . 
Hats Take your head off ! George proclaimed while Fred flicked the pointed hat decorated with a kind of fluffy pink fur in front of the students . Two Galleons each , see Fred perform ! 
Fred snapped his hat up and smiled . 
It just looked awkward for a second , and its hat and head disappeared . 
Some girls screamed but others laughed . 
And show up again ! George screamed , Fred's hand fumbling in the air behind his shoulder ; and then his head appeared when he took that pink fluffy hat . 
How does that hat work ? Asked Hermione , not concentrating on her homework and staring at Fred and George . 
I think this is definitely a Disaster , but it is cleverly expanding the field of ability to disappear beyond the boundaries of the spell . 
However , I can imagine that this spell will not last long . 
Harry did not respond , he felt sick . 
Tomorrow , I ' ll make this pile , it whispers and puts the notebook in my bag . 
Okay , record that in your lesson plan now ! Encouraged Hermione . Do not forget . 
Harry and Ron exchanged a look , then reached for the pair and pulled out the plan and hesitantly opened it . 
Do not forget it before it's too late , people leave you like you ! The book scolded as Harry scrawled in Umbridge's work . 
Hermione laughed . 
I thought I was going to bed , Harry said , tucking his notebook in his bag and remembering in his head for the first chance to ignore this emotion . 
Harry crossed the common room , trying to avoid George trying to capture a head cap on his head , and went to the peaceful and cold stone stairs and reached the male dormitory . 
He also felt like he was sick , just like the feeling of the night he dreamed about the serpent , but he thought lying down would help him feel better . 
He opened his bedroom door and at the very first step into the room , it felt very painful as if someone had inserted it inside the top of his head . 
He does not know where he is , standing or lying , and he does not even remember his name . 
A crazy laugh echoed in his ear ... he was happier after a long time ... jubilant , ecstatic , victorious ... something very cool , amazing out ... 
Harry ? 
Harry ! 
Someone is hitting his face . 
The crazy laugh was interrupted by a painful cry . 
The joy was withdrawn from him but the laughter continued . 
He opened his eyes and realized that the mad laugh came from his own mouth . 
As soon as he realized that , the laughter was over ; Harry gasped heavily on the floor , staring up at the ceiling , the scars on his forehead aching scaryly . 
Ron was leaning over to him , looking worried . 
What's going on ? she asked . 
I did not know Harry gasped and sat up . He is very funny ... 
Who - knows - who - knows - who ? 
Something very nice is happening , Harry murmured . 
He felt weaker than when he saw the snake attacking Mr. Weasley and it felt very painful . He wants to get something . 
He remembers , as soon as they were back in Gryffindor's Living Room , a stranger spoke through Harry's mouth , but he knew it was true . 
He took a deep breath , wanting to get out of it himself in front of Ron . 
He was glad that Dean and Seamus were not there and saw it at this time . 
Hermione told me to come see you , Ron whispered and helped Harry stand up . It says that his defense is weakened after Snape makes some inquiries with his mind ... and I think that will have a long way to go , right ? He hesitated to look at Harry and help him climb the bed . 
Harry fell on his head without a word of condemnation and he fell on his pillow , feeling pain after falling several times to the floor tonight , his scar still painful like a needle . 
It is impossible not to feel that the first breakthrough in Occlumency has weakened the mind's stamina to make it stronger ; He wanted to know with great fervor what had happened and to make Lord Voldemort so happy when he had survived for 14 years . 
Chapter 25 : PRESSURE WITH THE CHILD 
Harry's question was answered the next morning . 
When Hermione's Daily Prophet was sent , she straightened the newspaper , stared at the page for a moment , and then screamed out to make people around to look back . 
What's up ? Harry and Ron together . 
Instead of answering , she spread the newspaper in front of two children and pointed to ten black - and - white photographs covering the entire front page , nine with pictures of the masters , and the tenth picture of one . the witch . 
Some of those photos were secretly mocking a smile , others tapped their fingers at the edges of the photo , looking very insolent . 
Anthonin Dolohov , a script written under a witch with long , pale and distorted faces laughing at Harry , was sentenced to kill Gildeon and Fabian Prewell for brutal harshness . 
Algernon Rookwood , captioned under a photo of a peasant man with a sticky hair , was leaning against the edge of the photo , looking saddened , convicted for revealing the secrets of the Magic Book . For Those Who Do not Call Out . 
But Harry was paying attention to the picture of the witch . 
Her face was turning when Harry saw the front page . 
She has a long , black , tangled and thin hair in the photo , although Harry has seen it very thick and shiny . 
She glared at Harry with his dark eyes , with a haughty , contemptuous grin on his thin lips . 
Like Sirius , she still has traces of great beauty , but something - possibly Azkaban - has taken away most of her beauty . 
Bellatrix Lestrange , convicted of torture and the loss of Frank and Alice Longbottom . 
Hermione nodded to Harry and pointed to the head on the pictures that Harry was focusing on Bellatrix without reading . 
A GREAT LIFE FROM AZKABAN 
BLACK DISTRICT IS THE ' FORM ' OF THE DESTINATIONS FROM THE DAY . 
Black ? Said Harry loudly . Not - ? 
Shhh ! Hermione whispered . Do not say it loud - read it ! 
Last night , the Ministry announced that there was a large escape from Azkaban . 
Speaking to reporters from his private room , Cornelius Fudge , Minister of Magic , confirmed that ten carefully guarded prisoners escaped last night and informed the Prime Minister of Muggle about the danger of these people . 
" We felt it was unfortunate that we were in a situation like two and a half years ago when Sirius Black escaped , " he said last night . " Did we think that the two escape cases were unrelated ? 
The escape in such large numbers needed some help from outside , and we had to think that Black , the first man ever to escape from Azkaban , would be the ideal 
Helping others follow his footsteps . 
We thought it was fitting that these people , including Black's cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange , had gathered around Black like their leader . 
However , we are trying our best to criminally arrest criminals , and we ask that the whole of the Magics be cautious and vigilant . 
Do not let any of these guys come near you . ' 
This , Harry , Ron was horrified . That's why he was so happy last night . 
I can not believe it , Harry grumbled . Is Fudge blaming Sirius for the escape ? 
What else is he doing ? Said Hermione bitterly . He can not say , ' Excuse me , Dumbledore warned me that this would happen , the Azkaban guards had returned to Lord Voldemort - no more whispering , Ron - ' and those Voldemort's most dangerous advocate also escaped . " I mean , he spent six months telling everyone that you and Dumbledore were liars , right ? 
Hermione opened up the newspaper and began to read the inside information as Harry looked around the Great Hall . 
He could not understand why his friends were not scared or at least talked about the terrible news on the front page , but only a handful of them placed daily newspapers like Hermione . 
They're there , talking about Quidditch and other quirks , who knows , while outside these walls , ten Death Eaters join Voldemort's ranks . 
He glanced at the teacher's desk . 
The story here is different : Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall are exchanging , both seem extremely serious . 
Professor Sprout had a Prophet based on a bottle of tomato ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she did not notice the drops of egg yolk falling on her lap from the unmoving spoon . on hand . 
Meanwhile , at the far end of the table , Professor Umbridge was nibbling on a bowl of oatmeal . 
Only this time did her look - alike look around the Great Hall looking for students who behaved inappropriately . 
She scowled at the food and occasionally threw a malicious look at the table where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking . 
Oh ... Hermione amazed , still staring at the newspaper . 
What's more here ? Harry said quickly , he was feeling very nervous . 
It was ... terrible , Hermione was shocked . 
She folded the newspaper on the tenth page and handed it to Harry and Ron . 
St Mungo's hospital has promised a local investigation last night after a 49 - year - old Broderick Bode agent was found dead in bed . knit , strangled by a pot . 
The doctors referred to could not save Mr. Bode , who had been injured by a labor accident for several weeks before his death . 
Dr . Miriam Strout , who was in Bode's room at the time of the incident , was cut off yesterday and was not ready to comment , but the hospital spokeswoman said in a statement . declare : 
' St Mungo is very sorry for Bode's death , but his health is improving steadily before this catastrophic accident . 
' We had strict instructions on acceptable decorations in our rooms , but it was clear that Strout , busy with Christmas , did not notice the danger of the pots . Placed on the table next to Mr. Bode's bed . 
Because of his ability to speak and his flexibility , Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to take care of the pot , without realizing that it was not just a normal flitterbloom , which contained in it . is a demon trap , when the Bode patient touches him immediately strangled him . 
St Mungo has not yet been able to explain the source of the plant's existence in the ward and asks any witch about the village to report . ' 
Bode ... Ron said . 
Bode . 
It evokes something ... 
We saw him , Hermione whispered . In St Mungo Hospital , remember ? 
He lay on the bed opposite Lockhart's bed , just lying there , staring at the ceiling . 
And we saw the Devil's Trap . 
She - the doctor - said it was a Christmas present . 
Harry turned to look at the story . 
A sense of terror is rising like a bitter secret in his throat . 
How can we not recognize the Devil Trap ? 
We've seen it before ... they could have prevented this from happening . 
Who knows the Devil Trap back into the hospital by disguised as a pot . Said Ron sharply . That is not our fault , the one who sent it to him is responsible ! 
They are really stupid , why do not they check what they are buying ? 
Oh , come on Ron ! Hermione runs . I do not think anyone put a Devil Trap into a pot and did not realize that it was trying to kill people who touched it . This is a murder ... a smart murder ... if the tree was sent by anonymity , how did people find out who sent it ? 
Harry did not think of the Devil's Trap . 
He was recalling the elevator to the ninth floor of the Ministry on the day of his trial and the gold - faced man had entered the elevator at the entrance . 
I met Bode , he said slowly . I saw him at the Ministry with his father . 
Ron's mouth was open . 
I heard Dad talking about him at home ! 
He was banned , he worked at the Department of the Secret ! 
They looked at each other for a moment , then Hermione pulled the newspaper toward her , folded it , glared at the pictures of the Death Eaters , escaped on the front page , and walked away . 
Where are you going ? Ron snapped . 
Send a letter , Hermione said , squeezing her bag on her shoulder . This ... well , I do not know if it's okay or not ... but it's worth a try ... and I'm the only one who can . 
I hate this kind of baby . Ron grumbled as he and Harry left the table and walked slowly out of the hall . Would not that kill me if I told you what we were doing just once ? 
It's just another ten seconds ... hey , Uncle Hagrid ! 
Hagrid was standing by the door leading into the outer hall , waiting for the Ravenclaws to pass . 
He is still bruised heavily like the day he returned after completing his mission with the giants and had a new cut across his nose . 
True hip , two ? he said , trying to focus on giving a smile , but only a painful grimace . 
How are you , Hagrid ? Asked Harry , following him as he followed the Ravenclaws . 
Good , good , Hagrid said with a fake simplicity of comfort ; He waved his hand and almost did not find himself threatening Professor Vector is going through with a look of terror . are busy , you know , normal things - the lesson must be prepared - some falconers are rotten - and we are in challenging times , he murmured . 
Uncle is in the test ? 
Ron said so loudly , that so many students looked around curiously . Sorry , I mean - are you being challenged ? Ron whispered . 
Oh , Hagrid said . This is not worse than I thought , just tell me the truth . 
You do not have that , but that censorship is not very good , you know ... anyway , " he breathed . " Better go and rub some dry chili powder on them . , their salamanders or their tails will fall out . 
See you later ... 
Harry ... Ron ... " 
He walked slowly , out the door and down the stone stairs to the wet land . 
Harry watched him walk away , wondering how much more bad news he could get . 
The fact that Hagrid was in the middle of a challenge was known to everyone in the school a few days later , but before Harry's anger , hardly anyone seemed to be worried about it . Some people , especially Draco Malfoy , seem extremely happy . 
Like the bizarre death of an unnamed staff member at St Mungo's Hospital , Harry , Ron and Hermione are probably the only ones who know or care about . 
Now there is only one theme to speak of in the corridor : ten Death Eaters escape , which has spread throughout the school through a handful of readers . 
Rumors have circulated that some of the prisoners were discovered at Hogsmeade , that they were obliged to hide at the Shack and that they would break into Hogwarts , just as Sirius Black did . 
Those who came from the wizarding families who had grown up and heard the names of these Death Eaters were utterly scared to hear the name of Voldemort , the crimes they had It was during the reign of Voldemort that it was like a legend . 
There are relatives of their victims among Hogwarts students who have felt a reluctance of a terrible kind of reputation as they pass through the corridors : Susan Bode , The uncles , her and the cousins ​​ were all dead by the hands of one of these ten , poorly speaking in hereditary hours that she now had the right idea of ​​ a Harry - like feeling . how . 
" And I do not know how you can tolerate that - that's terrible , " she said bluntly , pouring too much of the phoenix into the tray of Screechsnap , making They writhe and squeal in frustration . 
Harry has been the latest subject of much talk and pointing in the corridor these days , but he thinks it can feel the difference in the whispered voices . 
They now seem more curious than hostile , and once or twice it is certain that it overheard a short conversation that stated that the children were not satisfied with the explanation . The Prophet was asked how and why the Death Eaters had decided to flee Azkaban . 
In the chaos and fear , these suspicious men now seem to be turning to the only valid explanation for them : what Harry and Dumbledore have been saying since last year . 
Not only the mood of the students changed . 
Now it is perfectly normal to go through two or three teachers talking in a very low and urgent whisper in the hallway , stop talking as soon as they see students approaching . 
" Everyone obviously could not talk freely in the teacher room , " Hermione said in a low voice , as she , Harry and Ron , passed through Professor McGonagall , Flitwick and Sprout clustered together at the door of the classroom . Charms one day . " It can not be when Umbridge is there . " 
" Do they know something new ? " Ron glanced at the three teachers over his shoulder . 
" If they knew , we would not be able to hear about it right ? " Harry frowned . " It's not after the Ordinance ... what's the number now ? " It was about the new announcement that had appeared on the notice board the morning after news of the kkaban escape : 
REQUIRED BY THE HIGH QUEST STUDENT IN HOGWART 
Teachers are not allowed to tell students any information that is not closely related to the subjects they are paid to teach . 
The announcement is based on Education Command No . Two Six . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , Senior Inspector . 
This latest Ordinance has been the subject of several series of jokes in students . 
Lee Jordan noted to Umbridge that under the terms of the new law she was not allowed to tell Freg and George about playing the Bluff at the back of the class . 
" The Blast has nothing to do with the Dark Arts Defense , Professor ! That's not something related to your subject ! " 
The next time Harry saw Lee , the back of his hand was bleeding badly , Harry had suggested to Murtlap . 
Harry thought that the Azkaban escapade lowered Umbride a little , that she might be embarrassed by the tragic end of the day under the nose of her beloved Fudge . 
This , however , only heightened her frenzy of taking every aspect of Hogwarts life under her personal control . 
She seemed determined , at least to complete the dismissal on a recent day , and the only question now was whether she was going to be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid . 
Every time the Prophet and the Cult Leader were controlled by the arrival of Umbridge and her singing . 
She hid by the fireplace in the perfumed room at the top of the tower , breaking Trelawney's agitated lectures with difficult questions about bird and mammal science , insisting she had to anticipate the answer . of the students before they respond and ask her to prove her ability to turn the glass sphere , tea leaves , and mystical stones in turn . 
A few times she passed her in the corridor - which was a very unusual event when she normally stayed in the room at the top of the tower - talking about herself , wringing her hands and throwing glances over her shoulders , and always smells of brown . 
Had he not been too worried for Hagrid , he would have felt sorry for her - but if one of them was fired , there was only one option for Harry to stay . 
Unfortunately , Harry could not see Hagrid performing a better performance than Trelawney . 
Although he seemed to obey Hermione's advice and did not teach the children what was more frightening than a Crup - a species indistinguishable from a rat hunter except for their stump - tail - since Christmas , he seems to have lost a lot of spirit . 
He had a strange and startling memory of his classes , forgot what he was saying to the class , answered the wrong question , and always looked at Umbridge anxiously . 
He was more and more distant from Harry , Ron and Hermione than he had been before , and completely forbidden to visit them when it was dark . 
" If she catches us now , we ' ll get enough , " he said emphatically to them , and had no desire to do anything more damaging to his career than to go down . Your hut in the evenings . 
To Harry , it seems that Umbridge is taking everything away from him that makes his life at Hogwarts worth living : to Hagrid's house , writing to Sirius , Firebolt and Quidditch . 
It revenges by the only thing it can do - double the effort for the DA . 
Harry was pleased to see that all of them , even Zacharis Smith , had been urged to work harder than before because the ten Death Eaters were relaxed , but no one's progress was worth it . noticed more of Neville . 
The news of his parents ' escape made a strange change and a little panic in it . 
She never talks about meeting with Harry , Ron and Hermione in the ward of St Mungo , and they also know the silence . 
It also did not say anything about the subject of Bellatrix and her accomplices escaping . 
Actually , Neville spoke very little at the DA meeting , working tirelessly with the spells and new spells Harry taught them , his plump face tense with concentration , apparently not . The difference is with injuries or accidents and work harder than anyone in the room . 
It has progressed so quickly and when Harry taught them the Guardian Spell - a spell that deflected the spells so they bounced back to the attacker - only Hermione managed to curse faster than Neville . 
Harry is willing to trade a lot for progress in the Occlumency mantra like Neville's advances during the DA meeting . 
The occasional confrontation with Snape , which had a bad enough start , did not progress at all . 
In contrast , Harry felt it was getting worse with each of these lessons . 
Before it begins to learn Occlumency , its scar is sometimes painful , usually at night , or under the strange signs of Voldemort's thoughts and emotions that it sometimes feels . 
However , these days , its scar is almost always painless , and it often feels in an anger or excitement that has nothing to do with what happened to it at the time , Usually accompanied by special aches and pains of the scar . 
It has a horrible impression that it is gradually becoming a kind of touch cord that oscillates under Voldemort's small emotions , and it is certain that this sensitivity is increasing after the first Occlumency lesson . with Snape . 
Worse yet , it's almost every night dreaming of going along the corridor that leads to the door of the Department of Mysteries , dreams that always reach its culmination in the prehistoric way . the black door is simple . 
" Maybe it's a bit like a disease , " said Hermione , looking anxious as Harry told this to her and Ron . " Like fever or something . 
It must get worse before it gets better . " 
" Lessons with Mr. Snape are making it worse , " said Harry firmly . " I'm sick of the scar and I'm tired of going down that corridor every night . " He rubbed his forehead angrily . " I just wished the door was open , I was tired of standing up and looking at it - " 
" That does not sound good , " said Hermione sharply . " Dumbledore did not want you to have dreams about that corridor , or you would not have trusted Snape to teach you Occlumency . 
You have to study harder . " 
" I'm studying ! " Harry said irritably . " You have to try it - Snape tried to penetrate his head - you know , it's not a fun game ! " 
" Maybe ... " Ron said slowly . 
" Maybe what ? " Hermione irritated . 
" Maybe it was not Harry's fault that he could not close his memory , " Ron said gently . 
" What do you mean ? " Hermione asked . 
" To see , maybe Snape did not really try to help Harry ... " 
Harry and Hermione stared at it . 
Ron looked grim and meaningful from one to the other . 
" Maybe , " he said again , in a lower voice , " he's actually trying to open Harry's memory a little wider ... to make it easier for the One Who Also - " 
" Do not say it , Ron , " Hermione was angry . " How many times have you suspected Snape , and have you ever been right ? 
Brother Dumbledore believes him , he also works for the Brotherhood , that's enough . " 
" He was a Death Eater , " said Ron unruly . " And we have not even seen evidence that he really rectified the righteousness . " 
" Dumbledore trusted him , " Hermione repeated . " And if we can not believe Dumbledore , we can not believe anyone else . " 
* 
With so many things to worry about and so much to do - a considerable amount of homework that the fifth - year student often has to do until midnight , the secret meetings of the DA and the The regular lesson with Snape - January seems to be a worrying one . 
Before Harry realized that , February arrived , carrying a dampmer and warmer climate , and the prospect of a second visit to Hogsmeade Village in the school year . 
Harry had very little time to chant with Cho since the two of them agreed to visit the village together , but suddenly he found himself facing Valentine's Day with all his girlfriends . 
On the morning of the fourteenth day , he dressed carefully in a special way . 
He and Ron came to breakfast the day they arrived . 
Hedwig was not there - not just Harry expecting it - but Hermione was yanking the letter from a strange brown beak as the kids sat down . 
" It's the right time ! 
If it does not come today ... " she said , eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small parchment . 
Her eyes ran from left to right as she read the letter and a completely satisfied expression appeared on her face . 
" Look , Harry , " she looked at it , " this is really important . 
Can you meet me at the Three Brooms Shop around noon ? " 
" to see ... I do not know , " said Harry uncertainly . " Make sure you want to spend all day with her . 
We have not said anything about what we are going to do . " 
" Oh , take her if you have to , " Hermione said immediately . " But do you come ? " 
" Um ... okay , but why ? " 
" I do not have time to tell you now , I have to answer this right away . " 
And she rushed out of the Great Hall , the letter clutched in one hand and the other in a piece of bread . 
" Are you coming ? " Harry asked Ron , but he shook his head , looking very moody . 
" I can not go to Hogsmeade a bit , Angelina wants us to practice all day . 
Can not do otherwise , we are the worst team we have ever seen . 
You should watch Sloper and Kirke , they are really pathetic , even worse than me . " He tried to take a long breath . " I do not know why Angelina did not let him out . " 
" Because you played well when you were in the team , " said Harry irritably . 
It felt very difficult to understand Ron's difficult situation , while he himself could trade almost everything to play in the next match with the Hufflepuff . 
Ron seemed to be concerned about Harry's voice , not mentioning Quidditch again during breakfast , and a little cold as they bid goodbye shortly thereafter . 
Ron departs for the Quidditch training ground and Harry , after trying to brush his hair in the invisible face of the coffee spoon , walks alone to the Outer Room to meet Cho , feeling cautious and confused . What will they talk about ? 
She waited for a moment at the front of the oak front door , which looked very beautiful with her hair tied behind to a sam's tail . 
Harry's legs seemed to be too big for his body as he stepped towards her and suddenly he noticed his arm and how crazy they looked when he swung around . 
" Hi , " said holding his breath . 
" Hi , " Harry replied . 
They looked at each other for a moment and Harry said , " Well , er - are we going now ? " 
" Oh , yes ... " 
The two of them entered the stream being signaled by Filch , occasionally catching sight of each other and smiling , but not talking to each other . 
Harry felt relieved when they went out into the open air , discovering that it would be easier to walk together in silence than to stand there looking at each other awkward . It was a fresh day , the wind was cold and when they passed through the Quidditch Stadium , Harry saw Ron and Ginny fly across the stage and felt a terrible shock that it was not there with them . 
" You really miss it , right ? " Cho said . 
He looked around and saw her looking at her . 
" Oh , " Harry sighed . " I miss that . " 
" Remember the first time we fought together , in the third year ? " She asked . 
" Yes , " Harry laughed . " You tried to stop yourself . " 
" And Mr. Wood says you do not have to be a gentleman anymore and just knock yourself out of the broom if you need to , " Cho laughed , remembering . " I heard that he was admitted to the Pride of Portree , right ? " 
" No , it was Puddlemere United , I saw him in the World Cup last year . " 
" Oh , I see you there too , remember ? 
We are in the same campground . 
Was it too funny ? " 
They talked about the Quidditch World Cup Final on the entire road down the driveway and out of the gate . 
Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her - it was not hard at all than talking to Ron and Hermione - and it began to feel confident and happy when Slytherin girls passing by , including Pansy Parkinson . 
" Potter and Chang ! " Pansy hissed at the chattering giggle . " Urgh , Chang , I do not understand your taste ... at least Diggory is handsome ! " 
The girls stepped up , talking and booing in exaggerated glances at Harry and Cho , leaving an awkward silence behind them . 
Harry could not think of anything else to say about Quidditch and Cho , slightly moved , was looking down at his feet . 
" So ... where do you want to go ? " Harry asked her as they entered Hogsmeade . 
The main street was full of students walking up and down , peering into the windows of the shop and talking croaking together on the sidewalk . 
" Yeah ... I do not know . " Said , shrugging . " Well , we ' ll go see the shops or something like that ? " 
They went to the Dervish & Banges store . 
A large poster was erected in the window and a few Hogsmeade villagers were watching it . 
They flinched aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself facing one more time with a photo of the Death Eaters escaping . 
The poster , " The Order of the Ministry , " offers a thousand Galleons reward for any witches with information that leads to the capture of any prisoner in the photo . 
" That's ridiculous , is not it , " Cho said in a low voice , looking up photos of Death Eaters , " remembering when Sirius Black escaped , and there were a lot of Priests all over the village of Hogsmeade to find . he ? 
And now the ten Death Eaters are loose , there is not a Dementor ... " 
" Oh , " Harry looked away from Bellatrix's face to look around Main Street . " Oh , so strange . " 
He does not feel nervous when there is no Dementor nearby , but now he is starting to think about it , their absence is really important . 
They not only let the Death Eaters escape , but also did not bother to look for criminals anymore ... they seem to have escaped from the ministry . 
The Death Eaters escape from every window that it and Cho go through . 
It started raining when they came to Scrivenshaft , the heavy , cold water drops falling on Harry's face and neck . 
" Um ... do you want to go for coffee ? " Cho hesitated , as the rain began to fall more and more heavy . 
" Oh , okay , " Harry looked around . " Where are you ? " 
" Oh , there's a great place in the neighborhood , have you ever been to Puddifoot's ? " She said cheerfully , leading it to an annexe and into a small tea shop that Harry had never been . to know it was a tight , damp place , where everything seemed to be decorated with lace and butterfly bow . 
Harry remembered Umbridge's office very uncomfortably . 
" Is not it great ? " He said happily . 
" Er ... yeah , " Harry lied . 
" Look , she's decorating it for Valentine's Day ! " Said Cho , pointing to a plethora of golden little angels floating around small , circular tables , occasionally throwing colored paper flowers . Purple people sitting there . 
" Aaah ... " 
They sat on the last remaining table , which was above a steam - filled window . 
Roger Davies , Ravenclaw Quidditch Team Leader , was sitting about a foot and a half with a beautiful blonde . 
They are holding hands . 
The scene made Harry feel uncomfortable , especially when , looking around the tea room , he saw the room full of couples , all of whom were holding hands . 
Maybe Cho wants it to hold her hand . 
" What can I do for you , my dear friends ? " Said Puddifoot , a fat woman with a shaggy black bundle of wool over their desk and Roger Davies's extremely hard . 
" Give me two coffees , " Cho said . 
While waiting for their coffee to arrive , Roger Davies and his girlfriend started kissing through their cup of sugar . 
Harry hoped they would not do so , it felt that Davies had set a standard that Cho would soon want it to pass . 
He saw his face getting hotter and trying to look out the window , but it was covered with water , unable to see the way out . Delaying the moment that he would have to look at Cho , he looked at the ceiling as if to admire the painting and get a handful of paper flowers straight into the face from their little angel . 
After a few hard moments , Cho mentioned Umbridge . 
Harry grabs the subject with relief and they spend a pleasant time defaming her , but the topic that was completely elicited at DA meetings can not last long . OK . 
Silence covered again . 
Harry could clearly see the collapse from the nearby table and look around to find something else to say . 
" Er ... listen , do you want to come with me to the Three Broom Shop this afternoon ? 
I'm going to meet Hermione Granger there . " 
Raise eyebrows . 
" Are you going to meet Hermione Granger ? 
Today ? " 
" Ừ . 
Well , she told me so , so I thought I would come . 
Do you want to go with me ? 
She said that it would be okay if you went with her . " 
" ... 
uh ... she is real " 
But Cho does not seem to feel that good or bad . 
In contrast , her voice was cold and sudden , and she looked a little uncomfortable . 
A few minutes later , in complete silence , Harry drank his coffee cup so quickly he needed a new glass . 
Next to them , Roger Davies and his girlfriend seem to be stuck together by their lips . 
Cho's hands are placed on the table next to her coffee and Harry feels a growing pressure to take it . 
Just take it , she told herself , like a wave of agitation and agitation rising in his chest , just stretch out his hand and grab it . 
To my surprise , it was much more difficult to raise an extra twelve inches and touched her hand compared to catching a snitch flying in space ... 
But when he reached out , Cho quickly removed his hand from the table . 
At this moment she was looking at Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a slight interest . 
" He invited me out , you know , " she said quietly . " A few weeks ago . 
Roger , though , refused . " 
Harry was holding onto the cup of sugar to avoid a sudden shock , unable to understand why she had told him this . 
If she wished she was sitting at the side table and receiving a warm kiss from Roger Davies , why did she agree to go with it ? 
She did not say anything . 
The little angel at their table threw another bunch of paper over their heads , a few of which fell into the cool little coffee Harry intended to drink . 
" I came here with Cedric last year , " Cho said . 
It took a few seconds to realize what she was saying , inside Harry suddenly became cold . 
She could not believe that she wanted to talk about Cedric at the moment , while the couple kissed and a small angel was hanging over them . 
Cho's voice was higher as she continued . 
" I wanted to ask you for a long time ... 
Cedric - Did he mention me before he died ? " 
This is the last topic in the world that Harry wants to talk about , at least for Cho . 
" Um ... 
" ... he said softly . " No ... no time for him to say anything . 
Erm ... so ... do you ... do you watch Quidditch on vacation ? 
You also support the Tornados , right ? " 
Its voice was fun and cheery . 
In horror , she saw her eyes filled with water , just as they had experienced after the last meeting of the DA before Christmas . 
" Look , " he said desperately , leaning closer so no one could hear , " let's not talk about Cedric at the moment ... let's talk about something else . " 
But , apparently , this is a completely false way . 
" I thought , " she said , tears falling down the table , " I thought you had h ... 
h ... understand ! 
I need to talk about this ! 
Sure you also ... need to talk about it ! I mean , you've seen it happen , right ? " 
Things are deflecting like a nightmare ; Roger Davies ' girlfriend split himself to see Cho crying . 
" Well , I talked about that , " said Harry , " with Ron and Hermione , but ... " 
" Oh , you told Hermione Granger ! " She whispered , her face now full of tears . 
Several other couples separated to look . " But you never told me ! 
C ... maybe it would be best if we were ... paying now ... right away and you went to meet Miss Hermione G ... 
Granger , like you obviously want to like ! " 
Harry stared at the girl , bewildered , as she grabbed a lace handkerchief and dabbed on her teary face . 
" Yes ? " He said weakly , only expecting Roger to hold onto his girlfriend and continue kissing to stop her from rolling her eyes and Cho . 
" Go away ! " she was crying in her handkerchief . " I can not understand why you would invite me first if you were planning to meet other girls after me ... how many girls do you expect to meet after Hermione ? " 
" It's not like that ! " Said Harry , and it was relieved that he finally understood what she was upset about , so much so that he laughed , which he recognized a fraction later than that . That is also a mistake . 
Let's get up . 
The tea room was quiet and everyone looked at them . 
" See you later , Harry , " she said suddenly , hiccups and rushed to the door , tugging at the door and hurrying out into the pouring rain . 
" Give it ! " Harry called after the little girl , but the door closed behind her with a tinkling sound . 
There was a complete silence in the tea room . 
All eyes were on Harry . 
He threw a bundle of Galleon on the table , shoved the purple flowers on his hair and followed him out the door . 
It was raining now and I could not see where she was . 
He just did not understand what had just happened , just half an hour ago , two children are progressing very well . 
" Daughter ! " He mumbled angrily , wading into the flooded road with his hands in his pocket . " Anyway , what does she want to talk about Cedric ? 
Why did she pull on the subject that made her look like a portable jet ? " 
She turned right and ran to splash water , and within a few minutes , she turned to the door of the Three Trinity . 
He knew that it came so soon to see Hermione , but he thought it would be fitting if there was someone there to talk to in the meantime . 
He wiped his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around . 
Uncle Hagrid was sitting alone in the corner , looking very sad . 
" Hi , Hagrid ! " He snapped through the rows of tables and pulled a chair next to him . 
Hagrid jumped up and looked down at Harry like he had just realized it . 
Harry saw him have two new cuts on his face and several new bruises . 
" Oh , are you , Harry , " Hagrid said . " Are you okay ? " 
" Yes , I'm fine , " Harry lied , but in front of a distorted and gloomy Hagrid , he felt it had little to complain about . " Er - Are you okay ? " 
" Uncle ? " Hagrid said . " Oh , you're great , Harry , great . " 
He looked down at the bottom of his tin cups , which had to be the size of large buckets , and sigh . 
Harry did not know what to say to him . 
They sit together in silence for a while . 
Then Hagrid suddenly said , " Same boat , you and me , right Harry ? " 
" Er ... " Harry responded . 
" Oh ... you said it once ... they are outsiders , alike , " Hagrid nodded in unison . " And orphaned . 
W ... orphaned . " 
He took a large sip in his glass . 
" Make a difference , have a good family , " he said . " My father is very kind . 
And his parents are kind . 
If they are alive , life will be different , right ? " 
" Yes ... I believe that would be , " said Harry cautiously . 
Hagrid seems to be in a very strange mood . 
" The family , " grumbled Hagrid . " Saying , blood is important ... " 
He wiped a blood stream over his eyes . 
" Uncle Hagrid , " said Harry , unable to stop himself , " where are you wounded ? " 
" Er ? " Hagrid startled . " What wound ? " 
" All of that ! " Said Harry , pointing at Hagrid's face . 
" Yeah ... just bruises and bumps , " Hagrid said casually , " I have a hard time . " 
He drank his cup , put it on the table and walked away . 
" See you later Harry ... remember to keep it . " 
He was out of the bar , looked miserable , and lost in the torrential rain . 
Harry looked at him with great affection . 
Hagrid was sad and he was trying to hide something , but he definitely did not need help . what's going on ? 
But before Harry could think of anything more , he heard a voice call his name . 
" Harry ! 
Harry , stay here ! " 
Hermione was waving it across the room . 
He got up and walked over to her through the crowded pub . 
It was only a few feet away when she realized that Hermione was not alone . 
She was sitting at a table with the few matching peers she could imagine : Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter , the former reporter for the Prophet and one of the little Hermione on earth . 
" You came so early ! " Hermione said , sitting down to make room for Harry . " I thought you were with Cho , I did not expect you at least an hour ! " 
" For ? " Rita said at once , turning around in her chair to see Harry devouring . " A girl ? " 
She grabbed her crocodile leather bag and groaned in it . 
" It's not your job to have Harry with a hundred girls , " Hermione said calmly to Rita . " So you can put that out right now . " 
Rita began to draw a blue pen out of the bag . 
Just as she was forced to swallow the rotten plastic , she closed it again . 
" What are you going to do ? " Asked Harry , sitting down and looking from Rita to Luna , then to Hermione . 
" Little Huynh just told me when you came here , " Rita said , taking a large sip from her drink . " I think I was allowed to talk to him , right ? " She glanced at Hermione . 
" Yes , I think you can , " said Hermione coldly . 
The unemployment is not compatible with Rita . 
The hair that had been bent in a good way was now straight and messy around her face . 
The red paint on her two - inch nails was grinding away and some of the precious ones were lost from her winged glasses . 
She swallowed another large sip and said from the corner of her mouth , " Is that beautiful girl , Harry ? " 
" Another word about Harry's affair is that the deal is over , that's the promise , " said Hermione irritably . 
" What agreement ? " Rita wiped her mouth with the back of her hand . " You never mentioned a deal , Miss Hardy , she just told me to appear . 
Oh , one day in recent days ... " She took a deep breath , shivering . 
" Yes , yes , one day she will write horrible stories about Harry and me , " said Hermione indifferently . " Find someone to care about , why do not you do that ? " 
" They've printed so many bad stories about Harry this year without my help , " Rita said , glancing over at her through the top of her glasses and adding a gruff whisper , How did that make you feel , Harry ? 
Distracted ? 
Treachery ? 
Hard to understand ? " 
" Of course she feels very angry , " said Hermione in a solid , clear voice . " Because she talks to the Ministry of Magic and she has so many idiots not to believe her . " 
" So you really hold the stance , are not you , the One Who's Not Calling the Return ? " Rita pulled down his glasses and asked Harry with a sharp look as her fingers trailed off . The crocodile leather briefcase . " Boy 
Supporting all the trash that Dumbledore has told people about the return to Who Who Knows and he is the only witness ? " 
" I'm not the only witness , " Harry grumbled . " There must be a dozen Death Eaters there . 
Want to know their name ? " 
" I'd love it , " Rita breathed , now fumbling in her bag again and staring at Harry as if it were the best thing she had ever seen . " A great headline in bold : ' Potter is condemned ... ' A secondary title , ' Harry Potter Tells The Name Of Death Eaters Still In Our Row . ' 
And then , underneath a beautiful photo of him , ' A troubled teen who survived the attack of the Who - Who - Know - Who , Harry Potter , 15 , has caused The good news yesterday was to accuse some respectable members and explode in the watershed community Death Eater ... " 
The Pens was actually in her hands and was halfway through her words as her happy expression disappeared . 
" But of course , " she said , lowering the brush and glaring at Hermione , " Little Huynh does not want this story to go out , is it ? " 
" In fact , " said Hermione gracefully , " that's exactly what the Little Chief wants . " 
Rita stared at the little girl . 
Harry too . 
And Luna , on the other hand , dreamily sang ' Weasley our King ' under his breath and pounded his water with an onion choke with a chopstick . 
" Do you want me to tell you what he's talking about ? " Rita asked Hermione in a whisper . 
" Yes , I want to , " said Hermione . " The true story . 
Total . 
Exactly what Harry said . 
He would give her all the details , he would tell her the names of the unknown Death Eaters he saw , he would tell her 
What is Voldemort looking like now - oh , calm down , " the little girl added , throwing the napkin through the table , because , hearing the name of Voldemort , Rita jumped so badly Pour half a cup of Fire Whiskey down her grandmother . 
Rita wiped her dirty raincoat , still staring at Hermione . 
Later , she said , without cover , " The Prophet will not print it . 
In case she has not announced before , no one will believe his drawing story at all . 
People will think that he is delusional . 
Now if you let me write a story from the side ... " 
" We do not need another story about how Harry lost his balls ! " Cried Hermione . " We had too many of these , thank you ! 
I want him to have the chance to tell the truth ! " 
" There will be no place for such stories , " Rita said coldly . 
" You mean the Prophet would not print it because Fudge did not let them do it , " said Hermione irritably . 
Rita threw a long and heavy glance at Hermione . 
Then , leaning forward through the table toward the little girl , she spoke in a businesslike voice , " Yes , Mr. Fudge is leaning on the Prophet , but it is the same . 
They will not print a story that shows Harry on the good side . 
No one wants to read it . 
It's against the general mood . 
The escape of Azkaban was enough for everyone to worry about . 
People will not want to believe Those Who Know Well . " 
" The Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear , is not it ? " Said Hermione harshly . 
Rita straightened up , raised her eyebrows and drank her glass of Whiskey . 
" The Prophet existed to sell , stupid little girl , " she said coldly . 
" My father thought it was a terrible newspaper , " Luna suddenly interrupted the story . 
Still drinking cocktail onions , she looked at Rita with her big , protruding , and slightly crazy eyes . " He publishes important conversations he thinks people need to know . 
He does not care about making money . " 
Rita looked disgusted at Luna . 
" I doubt your dad owns a crazy Village Announcement , " she said . " Perhaps , Twenty - Five Ways to Fight the Muggle People Publishing for Charity 
" 
" No , " Luna said , reciting her onion in her Gillywater , " he is the editor of the Wei Ching . " 
Rita snorted loudly , causing everyone in the nearby tables to look back . 
" Important stories that people think people need to know , huh ? " She said dismissively . " I can fertilize my garden with the contents of that trash . " 
" Oh , here's your chance to voice that , right ? " Hermione said cheerfully . " Luna said that her father was totally happy to interview Harry , that would be the publisher of the story . " 
Rita stared at the children for a moment , then burst out laughing . 
" The Enchantress ! " She giggled . " Do you think it would be important for him to be important to him when he was published in The Weiwe ? " 
" Some people do not , " Hermione said in a higher voice . " But the Prophet Numbers talk about the Azkaban escapade filled with unbelievable flaws . 
I think there will be a lot of people wondering that there will be no better explanation for what's going on , and if there is another story right , it's even published in a ... " glances at Luna , " in a ... 
Hmm ... an unusual magazine - I think they would love to read it . " 
Rita did not say anything at the time , looking at Hermione sharply , her head slightly inclined to one side . 
" Okay , let's talk about when I'm doing it , " she said suddenly . " What royalties will I get ? " 
" I do not think Dad exactly paid for everyone to write for the newspaper , " Luna said vaguely . " They do it because it's a reputation and , of course , to see their name on the press . " 
Rita looks like the smell of Plastic Resin spilling into her mouth as she turns back to Hermione . 
" Do I have to do this ? " 
" Well , yes , " said Hermione calmly , taking a sip in her cup . " On the other hand , as you know , I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Unregistered Man . 
Of course , the Prophet might give her a lot of royalties on the life of an insider in Azkaban . " 
Rita looked like she did not like anything more than grabbing the small paper umbrella that was popping up in Hermione's cup and plugging her in the nose . 
" I'm not allowed to have any choice , do you ? " Rita said , a little shaky . 
She opened the crocodile leather bag again , took out a piece of parchment and lifted the pens . 
" Dad would be very pleased , " Luna said quietly . 
Rita's jaw jerked to one . 
" okay , Harry ? " said Hermione , turning to him . " Ready to tell people the truth ? " 
" I believe so , " said Harry , watching Rita adjusting the Pen to the ready position on the parchment between them . 
" Let's get started , Rita , " said Hermione calmly , peering at the bottom of her glass . 
Chapter 26 : KNOW AND DO NOT KNOW BEFORE 
Luna is vague that she does not know how Rita's interview with Harry will appear in the Quibbler , and that the three girls are expecting a long and good article about the " Luna added , " And of course , that would be a very important story , and Harry would have to wait until later . " 
Harry was very miserable when talking about Voldemort's return . 
And Rita tried to force Harry to remember the smallest details , as if this was a great opportunity for Harry to tell the truth to the world . 
He predicted that this story would make many people believe that it was completely insane , especially because it would appear right next to the rubbish of Crumple - Horned Snorkacks . 
But the escape of Bellatrix Lestrange and the Death Eaters made Harry earnestly desire to do something , no matter what the outcome . . 
" I can not wait to see how Umbridge is before you show up in front of everyone , " Dean said at a Monday meal , his voice frightening . 
Seamus is touching a bunch of lice and chicken next to Dean , but Harry knows that he's still listening . 
" You're right , Harry , " Neville said , sitting right in front of Harry . 
Neville looked rather pale , but continued with a low voice , " Surely ... difficult ... talk about it ... right ? " 
" Oh , " murmured Harry , " but everyone must know what Voldemorts can do now , ha ? " 
" Oh , " Neville nodded , " and , even the Deathly Hallows ... everyone should know ... " 
" 
Seamus looked around but suddenly encountered Harry's eyes , he quickly bent down and continued eating . 
Shortly after , Dean , Seamus , and Neville leave the common room , leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron , Ron to quit dinner to practice Quidditch . 
Cho walked into the hall with her friend Marietta . 
Harry's stomach was swollen , but Cho Chang did not even look at Gryffindor's table , and Harry turned his back on Harry . 
" Oh , I forgot to ask you , " Hermione said cheerfully , glancing over at Ravenclaw's desk , " How's your date with Cho ? 
Why come back so early ? " 
" Er ... well , then ... " Harry hesitated , pulling a plate of rhubarb crumble toward him , " complete failure , now you're talking again . 
" 
And she told Hermione what had happened in Mrs. Puddifoot's tea shop 
" ... then , " a few minutes later , when the buns finally finished , Harry finished , " she jumped up , yes , and said , " See you later , Harry , " and ran away . " He set the spoon down and looked at Hermione . " I mean , what does that all mean ? 
What's happening ? 
Hermione glanced behind Cho's head and said in sigh . 
" Oh , Harry , " she said sadly . 
" I'm sorry , but you were a little unkind . 
" 
" Auntie , not polite ? " Harry felt slightly offended . 
" For the first minute we were doing well , and the next minute she told me Roger Davies asked her to leave Quidditch and how she always dated Cedric at that absurd teahouse - I had to Think about that ? 
" Okay , you know , " said Hermione , with the patience of the person who was trying to explain that one - plus - two for a toddler and vulnerable , You do not need to tell her that you want to meet her halfway through the appointment . 
" 
" But , But , " Harry stammered , " But - you say you meet me at 12 and go with her , how can I let her go without telling her all ? 
" 
" You should tell her otherwise , " said Hermione , still with that patience . " You should have said you were really upset , but I made you promise to come with me to Three Broomsticks , and you really do not want to go any further , you want to go out . All day long with her , but you think you have to meet me anyway , and you want her to please , please go with you and hopefully you will soon get out of there . - : Listen to some of you - sk > And you can also point out how bad you are , " added Hermione . 
" But I do not think you're bad , " said Harry stupefied . 
Hermione smiled . 
" Harry , you are worse than Ron ... oh , no , no , " she sighed , while Ron himself was trotting into the hall , the mud slamming and looking very choppy . " See - you make trouble when you say you will meet , so she will try to make you jealous , that is how she tries to see how you like her . 
" Is that what she's doing ? " Harry asked , as Ron collapsed onto the couch in front of them and pulled out all the dishes in his reach . 
" Well , is it much better if she just asked me if I liked her more than you ? " 
" Girls do not usually ask such questions , " said Hermione . 
" Oh , but should ask ! " Said Harry vigorously . 
And then I can say right away that I love her , and she does not need to suggest to herself that Cedric is dead . " 
" I'm not saying that everything she does can be felt , " said Hermione , as Ginny went in , muddy like Ron and looked irritable . 
" I'm just trying to make you understand how she feels right now . 
" 
" You should write a book , " Ron told Hermione as he cut some potatoes , " compiling the daughters ' madness so that the boys could understand . 
" 
" That's right , " Harry responded enthusiastically . > look at the table Ravenclaw . 
For just waking up , and , still not looking at it , she left the hall . 
Feeling rather disappointed , it turned to Ron and Ginny . 
" How are you doing Quidditch ? " 
" It's a nightmare , " said Ron in a scowl . 
" Oh , come on , " said Hermione , looking at Ginny , " I'm sure not - 
" That's right , " Ginny said . " This is terrible . 
Sister Angelina nearly cried at the end of the rehearsal . 
After dinner , Ron and Ginny stand up to take a bath ; Harry And Hermione returned to Gryffindor's bustling common room and a routine of exercises . 
Harry struggled with a new astronomical map for half an hour when Fred and George went up . 
" Ron and Ginny are not here ? " Fred asked , looking around as he pulled the chair , and when Harry shook his head , he said , " Good . 
We watched them practice . 
They will be defeated completely . 
They are completely abandoned without us . " 
" Yeah , but Ginny is not that bad , " George said in a fair voice , sitting down beside Fred . 
" Actually , I do not know how it can work so well , especially when we never let it play together . 
" 
" She broke into the broom in the garden at the age of six , and then tried each of the brooms while they were away , " says Hermione from the back of her books , Ancient Rune books . welcome . 
" Oh , " George said , looking impressed . " Well - that explains everything . 
" 
" How did Ron get any results ? " Hermione asked , peering over the top of the Secret Code - and the sign - the magic sign . 
" Well , he can do it if he does not think that someone is watching him , " Fred said , closing his eyes . " So all we have to do is come Saturday to ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk to each other every time the Quaffle flew to Ron's goal . " 
He stood up again and moved endlessly to the window , staring into the dark ground on the other side . 
" You know , Quidditch is almost the only thing here worth the stay . 
" 
Hermione threw him a stern look . 
" Your exams are coming ! " 
" I said , we're not really interested in the exam anymore . < Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests > , " Fred said . " The Snackboxes are ready , we have found a way to give up cooking , just two drops of Murtlap essence is finished , Lee showed us . 
George yawned long and bored to look at the cloudy night sky . 
" I do not know if I want to watch this match anymore . 
If Zacharias Smith defeated us , I would have killed myself . 
" 
" Kill him , listen better , " Fred said firmly . 
That's Quidditch's problem , " Hermione said absently , once again kneading the Runes - English translation , " It creates all the tension and aversion between the houses . 
" 
She was looking for a copy of Spellman's Spellman Sign , and made Fred , George and Harry all staring at her with emotionally mixed expressions of anger and disbelief . their faces . 
" Well , yes , " she said impatiently . 
" It's just a game , right ? " 
" Hermione , " Harry shook his head and said , " You know a lot about love and stuff , but you do not understand Quidditch . " 
" Maybe , " she said blankly , returning to her translation , " but at least my happiness does not depend on Ron's ability to catch the ball . " 
And although Harry would rather have jumped out of the Astronomical Observatory in order not to accept it with Hermione , but when watching the game on Saturday , it was willing to trade a lot of Galleon - gold was also to be uninterested . Quidditch . < Hi hi ! This time I lost Galleon is the gold that has been translated : it would rather accept fighting with a war boat as many ships are not to worry about . > 
The very good thing you can say about the game is that it's extremely short ; 
Those who watch the Gryffindor house suffer only twenty - two minutes of pain . 
It's hard to say what the worst is : Harry thinks it's a tight fit between the fourteen failures of Ron , Sloper misses the Blugger , but the racket fires right into Angelina's mouth , and Kirke screams . , falling back out of the broom as Zacharias Smith leaps past carrying the Quaffle . 
The miracle is that the Gryffindor team only lost 10 points : Ginny snatched the Snitch right under the captain of the Hufflepuff Summerby , and the score was two hundred and forty - two hundred and thirty . 
" Beautiful shot , " said Harry to Ginny then in the common room , where the atmosphere was gloomy as if there was a special funeral . 
" I'm lucky , " she shrugged . " The Snitch did not fly so fast and Summerby got a cold , he sneezed and closed his eyes at the very moment . 
Anyway , there will be times when he returns to the team - " 
" Ginny , you've been banned for life . 
" 
" You were only forbidden while Umbridge was in school , " Ginny corrected . " That's different . 
Anyway , I believe there will be times when I come back , I think ... then I will try to play Trace . 
Angelina and Alicia will leave the team next year and I prefer scoring rather than chasing . 
Harry looked at Ron , who was bent in the corner , staring at his knee , holding the beer . 
" Angelina will still not let Ron retreat , " Ginny said , as if reading Harry's mind . 
She said she knew he was thinking . 
" 
Harry liked Angelina for the belief she put in Ron , but at the time he thought it would be better for Ron to leave the team . 
Ron left the Slytherins singing " Weasley is our King " with great excitement , now the Slytherins are the brightest candidates of the championship . 
Fred and George walk through . 
" I did not even have the mind to tease him , " Fred said , looking over Ron's dismay . " Remember ... when it missed the 14 th - " 
His hand moved like a dog in a vertical position . 
" Then , I ' ll remember some parties , eh ? " 
Ron pulled himself to bed not long after all this . 
Respect your feelings , Harry waited a moment before going up to the bedroom , so Ron could pretend he was asleep if he wanted to . 
When it is enough , Harry finally walks into the room , Ron snoring slightly larger than normal . 
Harry climbed onto the bed , thinking about the match . 
It was very depressing when standing outside the border . 
Harry was impressed by Ginny's performance but he knew if it was played , it might have caught the Snitch sooner ... at some point it hovered near Kirke's fisheye ; If Ginny did not hesitate , she might have earned a win for Gryffindor . 
Professor Umbridge was sitting under Harry and Hermione in a row . 
One or two times she was squatting on the bench , Harry's large , open mouth that Harry thought she was laughing triumphantly . 
That memory makes it feel like an angry flame in the night . 
However , minutes later , he remembers that he had to get rid of these feelings before he went to sleep , as Snape had told him at the end of each Occlumency class . 
Harry tried one or two times , but the thoughts of Snape added to Umbridge merely adding to the sense of hatred , and he found himself concentrating on how he hated them . . 
Slowly , Ron's snoring was gradually replaced by the sound of deep and slow breath . 
It took a while for Harry to sleep ; Its body has been weakened , but its mind has been resting for a long time . 
He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltz around the Requirement Room while Professor McGonagall played the trumpet . 
He happily watched them for a while , then decided to go look for other members of the DA ( Defense Team - NA ) . 
But when it left the room , facing it , it was not a crazy Barnabas - like carpet , but a burning torch on the stone wall . 
Harry turned his head to the left . 
At that distance , at the far end of the No - Doors - windows is a smooth , black door . 
It goes up there with a surge of excitement . 
It has a very strange feeling that it will end up in luck , and it tries to open the door ... 
It's just a few feet away , and it looks like a light blue band to the right of the open door . 
It pushes the door open and ... 
he rattled , the trumpet and Harry woke up with his right forearm in the dark , to open a door hundreds of miles away . 
He lowered his hands with a mixture of depression and guilt . 
He knew that he should not look at the door , but the intriguing sense of what was behind the door did not make him feel annoyed by Ron ... 
Ron only lingered in a few minutes and then snore . 
* 
They walked into the hallway to have breakfast at exactly the same time as the Dugongs - letters on Monday morning . 
Hermione is not the only one eagerly waiting for the Daily Prophet : Nearly everyone wants to know more about the Death Eaters , they , though . There have been many reports of sightings , but have not yet been arrested . 
She gave the owl a Knut delivery and eagerly opened the newspaper while Harry was stirring a glass of orange juice ; While receiving only one letter for the whole year , Harry was sure that , when the first owl landed in the grass in front of him , it was looking up at him . 
" Who are you giving the letter to ? " He asked , lazily pulling the orange juice underneath to avoid the beak of the bird and lean forward to see the name and address of the recipient : 
Harry Potter - Hall - Hogwarts School 
Thoughtfully , he took the letter from the owl , but did not do so , three , four , five more owls flew to the side and took their place , they trampled on butter and salt to try to give Harry a letter first . . 
" What is this ? " Asked Ron pleasantly , while Gryffindor's whole table leaned forward to see the other seven owls landed among the first , chirping and pounding . 
Harry ! " Said Hermione , dipping her hands in her hair and pulling out an owl carrying a long , tubular packet . 
I think I know what this means - open this first ! " 
Harry ripped the brown package off . in a tight copy of The Quibbler March . 
He opened it and saw the face of him who was grinning at the front cover . 
In the big red letters stretching across the photo are the words : 
NARRATIVE : 
THE TRUTH ABOUT KY - WHICH - NO - SHOULD - CALL - NAME - OUT 
AND THE NIGHT THAT I SEE HAPPEN TO BACK 
" That's good , too , " Luna said , as she waded through Gryffindor's table and now crammed on the bench between Fred and Ron . 
" It was published yesterday , I asked her to send me a free copy . 
I suppose all these things , " she wiped out all the owls still lurking around the Table in front of Harry , " were the letters from the reader . 
" 
That's what I think , " said Hermione enthusiastically . 
" Harry , would you mind if we - ? " 
" Just be yourself , " said Harry , feeling a little shocked . 
Both Ron and Hermione started to open the envelope . 
This one from a guy thinks you're crazy , " said Ron , looking at the letter . 
" Ah ... " 
This woman advised you to try a Strong Intensity mantra at St Mungo Hospital , " said Hermione , looking depressed and a little disappointed . 
This looks good , " Harry said slowly , scanning a long letter from a witch at Paisley . 
" Hey , she said she believed me ! 
" 
This one has two opinions , " Fred said , and he was eager to take part in opening the letter . " He said you did not appear like a madman , but he really did not want to believe that Ke - who - knows - who - is - back , so he does not know what to think about now . 
Oh , waste of paper too . 
" This is another one of you , Harry ! " said Hermione delightfully . 
" I read your story , I have to say that the Japanese newspaper treats you very unfairly ... 
Even though I do not want to think of any - Who - knows - who - is - it's back , I still have to accept that you are the truth ... 
Oh , that's great ! " 
Another person thinks you are lying , " said Ron , throwing a crumpled letter over Harry's shoulder . " 
But the other person says you changed her and she now thinks you are really a hero - she even included a photo - wow ! 
" 
" What is this ? " A fake sweet voice said . 
Harry looked up with his hands on the envelope . 
Professor Umbridge is standing behind Fred And Luna , sweeping through the pile of owls and letters . 
Behind her , Harry saw many students watching them drunkenly . 
Why do you have all these letters , Potter ? " She asked slowly . 
" Now that's a crime ? " Fred said vehemently . " receive the letter ? " 
" Be careful , Mr. Weasley , or I ' ll have to ban you , " Umbridge said . 
" Why , Potter ? 
" 
Harry hesitated , but he did not know how to keep all this secret ; 
It is likely that Umbrella will see the Japanese newspaper - the prophet is only a matter of time . 
" I wrote to you because you had an interview , " said Harry . " About what happened last June . 
" 
For some reason , Harry glanced up at the table when he spoke . 
Harry had a strange feeling that Dumbledore had watched it a few seconds before , but when he looked at the Rector , he seemed to be engrossed in dialogue with Professor Flitwick . 
" An interview ? " Umbridge repeated , her voice was thinner and taller than ever . 
" What do you want to say ? " 
" I want to say that a reporter asks me questions and I answer them , " said Harry . 
" here it is - " 
And it gives a copy of The Killer - for - Professor . 
She caught it and stared at the cover . 
Her pale face turned into an ugly , mottled purple . 
" When did you do this ? " She asked , her voice fluttering slightly . 
" Last weekend at Hogsmeade , " said Harry . 
She looked at it , the anger burning , the magazine swirling in her short and fat fingers . 
There will be no Hogsmeade trip , Potter , " she whispered . " How dare you ... how could you ... " She took a deep breath . " I have tried all the time . Teach you not to lie . 
That message , apparently , has not yet penetrated . 
Except for the Gryffindor House 50 points and a week ban . 
She dug out , hugging the K - stupid - in front of the chest , many students still follow her eyes . 
In the middle of the morning , large plates were placed throughout the school , not only in the notice room , but also in the corridors and classrooms . 
UNDER THE ORDER OF THE HOGWARTS HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTION 
Any student who appears in the K - pop magazine will be expelled . 
The above decision is in accordance with the Educational Decree No . Twenty Seven . 
Signed : Dolores Jane Umbridge , Senior Inspector 
* 
For some reason , every time Hermione caught one of the tables she was delighted . 
" What exactly are you happy about ? " Asked Harry . 
" Oh , Harry , do not you see ? " Hermione exclaimed . 
" If she can do one thing to make sure every single person in this school reads your interview , then this is it ! " 
And it looks like Hermione is quite right . 
Until the end of the day , though , Harry did not see a sample of The Killer in any place in the school , but everyone seemed to be quoting the interview . 
Harry heard them whispering about it while lining up outside the classroom , discussing it during lunch and after school , while Hermione even reported that girls in the toilet Also talk about it when she enters it in front of Ancient Runes . 
" Then they found out , and they clearly knew they knew you , so they put a lot of questions on them , " Hermione told Harry , eyes bright , " and Harry , I think they Believe me , I really believe it , I think they are finally convinced ! 
" 
In the meantime , Professor Umbridge walked around the school , randomly picking up many students and asking them to open all the books and bags : Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Killer , but The students went a few steps ahead of you . 
The newspaper interviewed Harry was allowed to copy so that other people except his master could see all the excerpts from the textbook , or blanked until the children wanted to read it again . 
It seems that everyone in the school has read it . 
Teachers were also banned from mentioning the interview because of the Twenty - Sixth Education Order , but they all found ways to express the same feeling about it . 
Professor Sprout gave the Gryffindor twenty points because Harry handed her a watering pot ; Professor Flitwick grinned at him with a squeaking sugar mice box at the end of the Charm , and said , " Shit ! " And urged her out ; and Professor Trelawney was thrilled to sob during the seminary , and the statement made the class startled not agreeing with Umbridge , saying that Harry would not die soon , old man , that he would become Minister of Magic and have dozens of children . 
But the thing that makes Harry so happy is when Cho catches up with him while he is hurrying to the Transfiguration class the next day . 
Before Harry knew what was happening , she took hold of her hand and sat up in his ear sobbing : " Harry , I really ... really want to apologize to you ... that interview . ... it was brave ... it made me cry . " 
It was so sorry to hear that she said she cried so much ( because of it ) , but she was also glad that they had talked intimately , even better when she kissed him on the cheek first . when hurry to run away . < Oh , really cool , is not it ? with it . 
" I just want to say , " Seamus muttered , glancing at Harry's left knee , " I believe you . 
And I sent a copy of that magazine to my mother . 
If anything needed to make Harry's happiness complete , that was the reaction of Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
Harry saw them bunched up the next afternoon in the library ; standing with a haggard boy Hermione whispered named Theodore Nott . 
They looked around Harry as he was searching on the shelf of the Partial Vanishment book he needed : Goyle bent his scissors and threatened Malfoy with something for Crabbe , evil . 
Harry knew exactly why they acted like that : they named their father , calling them Death - real . 
" And the best part , " Hermione whispered , while they left the library , " are they not arguing with you , because they can not admit they read the article ! 
In addition , Luna told Harry at dinner that there was no such thing as a quick sale of the Kẻ - libs . 
" I ' ll give you a copy ! " She said to Harry , eyes wide open . " I can not believe it , " he said . " People seem to like it more than the Snorkacks . 
Harry was a hero in Gryffindor's common room that night . 
Boldly , Fred and George cast a large incendiary on the front cover of the Wei - Wei and hang it on the wall , occasionally saying something like " WHAT IS THE WINDOWS " and " EATING , UMBRELLA " in a resonant voice . 
Hermione did not find this funny ; The girl said she was disturbed , unable to concentrate , resulting in an angry girl going to bed early . 
Harry had to confess that the poster was no longer funny after an hour or two , especially when the echo sound began to disappear , it merely screamed discrete words like " DIVISION " and " UMBRIDGE " with The closer and closer the voice , the higher the voice . 
( Newbie starts here ! À Sun King's made last corrections on 8 / 4 / 2003 3 : 52 PM ) 
In fact , his head began to hurt and his scar was burning again . To satisfy the expectations of the people around , ask him to recount the interview countless times , he found it too need to go to bed early . 
When Harry went up to the dorm , the place was completely deserted . 
He pressed his forehead against the bedside glass for a while ; This causes the scar to soften . 
Then she changed and went to bed , hoping that the headache would disappear . 
He felt a little tired . 
He rolled to one side , closed his eyes , and almost fell asleep . 
He lay down on his side , his eyes closed , he fell asleep again . 
It was standing in the dark , only a few lit candles lit up the room as closed as this . His hands tightened on the front bench . His hands had long , white fingers as if they had not been exposed to sunlight for years , pale as they reflected the dark color of the chair and looked like giant spider legs . . 
in front of the chair , still illuminated by the candles and also where another man was kneeling before him - one in black robes . 
" It looks like we got some bad advice , " said Harry in a cold accent mixed with rage . 
" Master , please forgive my dad , " the man was kneeling on the floor moaning . 
Candles flickered over his head . 
He looks really scared . 
" I do not blame you , Rookwood , " said Harry in that cold , violent voice . 
He stopped clinging to the chair , started walking around the chair , and approached the croaking man on the floor , until he stood straight in front of him in the dark , looking down from a higher plane than normal . 
" Do you believe in your argument , Rookwood ? " Asked Harry . 
" Yes , Master , yes ... 
My dear ones ... after all working in the committee ... " 
" Avery told me that Bode might have taken it . " 
" But Bode has never been able to do that , Master . 
Bode knows that he can not be ... sure , so he seeks to fight Mafloy's monstrous ( Imperius ) curse . " 
" Stand up , Rookwood , " Harry whispered . 
He almost obeyed in a hurry and fear . 
On his face there are deep scars ; These scars are exposed by candlelight . 
And he continued to stoop down even as he stood , as if he were a bow ; he glanced at Harry in fear . 
" You acted right when you told me this , " said Harry . " Very true ... 
It seems we have wasted months of useless plans ... but nothing ... we will start again , right now . 
You have my gratitude - Lord Voldemort , Rookwood ... " 
" Yes , my master ... yes , " Rookwood gasped , his thick voice softening somewhat . 
" I will need your help . I will need all the information that the person can provide . " 
" Of course , Master , of course ... whatever ... " 
" Very good ... you can go . " 
" Call Avery here . 
" 
Rookwood hastily bowed and retreated , going through a door and he disappeared . 
Alone in the dark room , Harry is approaching the wall . 
Cracks in the wall are hanging a dirty old mirror that dimly reflects the silhouette . 
Harry approached closer . 
The mirror image becomes clearer and larger in the dark ... 
A white face more than a skull ... eyes are reddish , pupils just like a gap ... 
" HAPPY BIRTHDAY ! 
" 
" What ? " A scream from beside him . 
Harry reeling madly , being entangled in the curtain and falling off the bed . 
After a few seconds , he still does not know where he is ; He was convinced that he had just seen a white face like a skull that appeared dimly in the dark , and then he heard Ron's voice briefly . " You can stop your grotesque , so I can take you out of this bunch ! " 
Ron jerked the screen to pieces and Harry glared at Ron under the moonlight , feeling his scar scarring . 
Ron looked as if he was sleepy ; One of his hands was out of his shirt . 
" Has someone been attacked ? " Asked Ron as he pulled Harry's feet hard . " My father ? 
Still the snake ? 
" No - everyone is fine - " Harry gasped , as if his forehead was burning on fire . " ... 
Avery was not ... he was in trouble ... he gave the wrong information ... 
Voldemort was really angry . " Harry groaned , trembling and then he collapsed , in his bed , his hands still rubbing on his scar . " But now , Rookwood has helped him ... and he's headed in the right direction . " 
" What are you talking about ? " Ron cried out in awe . 
" You ... you mean ... you've seen Who - knows - who - is - you ? " 
" I was him , " said Harry , stretching his arms out to the darkness , putting them in front of him , checking for dead white and long fingers . " He met Rookwood , one of the Death Eaters who fled Azkaban , remember ? 
Rookwood told him that Bode could not do it . 
" Do what ? " 
" Take something ... he said Bode knew that he could not have done it ... " 
Bode was controlled by the imperial curse ( Imperius ) . 
I think he said Malfoy's father had taken him over . " 
" Bode was spell for something ? " Said Ron . " But - Harry , what is that ? " 
" Weapon , " Harry concluded , " I know . " 
The door to the dormitory opened ; Seamus and Dean came in . 
Harry quickly reached for his bed . 
He does not want things to be seen , Seamus just recently thought that Harry was a crazy guy . 
" Are you saying , " Ron whispered , leaning his head at Harry pretending to help Harry pour the water from the jar on the side table , " you were the Who - Who - Know - Who - what ? 
" Oh , " Harry whispered . 
Ron took the vase unkindly ; Harry saw the water flowing from Ron's chin and flowed down his chest . 
" Harry , " he said , while Seamus and Dean were making noise because they were wearing robes and talking , " you have to tell ... " 
I will not tell anyone , " said Harry briefly . " I might not have seen it if I had done the Occlumency . You have to learn to put an end to all this . that's what they want . " 
Harry uses " them " to refer to Dumbledore . 
He returned to his bed , curled up and turned his back on Ron , and a moment later he heard a creak of Ron's mattress , Ron had fallen asleep . 
Harry's scar seems to start burning ; She bites into the pillow to prevent herself from shouting again . 
He knew , somewhere out there , Avery was being punished . 
* 
Harry and Ron had to wait until morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened ; They want to be sure they will not be heard . 
Still standing in the corner of the courtyard and airy as ever , Harry said every detail that he remembered for Hermione . 
When it finished the story , she was still pensive for a moment , but was staring uneasily at Fred and George's annoying , both were stupid and they were selling magical hats . under the slacks on the other side of the school grounds . 
" So they killed him , " she said quietly , finally stopping glaring at Fred and George . " When Bode tried to steal this weapon , something funny happened to him . 
I think that would have been a defensive spell cast on it , or around it , to prevent others from touching it . That is why he was at St Mungo , his mind became very weird and he could not speak . 
But do you remember what the physician told us ? 
He is recovering . 
And they can not be risky when he's recovering right ? 
I think the shock when he touched that weapon , solved the poison curse - guess . 
Again he spoke , he explained what he was doing ? 
They would know he was sent to steal weapons . 
And so , of course , Lucius Malfoy was pretty easy to cast a spell on him . 
Has he never been kicked out of Magic ? 
I heard he even circled the Ministry all day . 
Said Harry 
" Inside - wait a minute ... " he said slowly . " He was in the Secret Board in those days ! 
Your father said he tried to sneak in to try to find out what happened in his trial , but if - " 
" Mr. Sturgis ! " Hermione gasped , looking startled . 
" Huh ? " Ron replied in confusion . 
" Sturgis Podmore - " hastily Hermione , " was arrested for trying to get through a door ! 
Lucius Malfoy must have charmed him too ! 
I bet he did it the day you saw him there . 
Did Sturgis use Moody's invisible cloak , right ? 
So ... what would happen if he was guarding the door , invisible , and perhaps Lucius had heard him go - either guessing who was there - or just trying to curse Guess who's watching that door ? 
So when Sturgis had the next chance - perhaps when he next came in - he tried to break in to steal Voldemort's weapon - Ron - Unless he was arrested and sent to The Azkaban Prison ... " 
Hermione stared at Harry . 
" And now Rookwood tells Voldemort how to get a weapon ? " 
" I did not hear the conversation , but it sounded like that , " said Harry . 
" Rookwood worked there ... 
Will Voldemort possibly install Rookwood to do that ? " 
Hermione nodded , seemingly still thinking . 
Then , quite unexpectedly , she said , " But you should not see these things , Harry . " 
" HELL ? " It jerked . 
" You have to learn to avoid this in your mind , " said Hermione suddenly . 
" I know , I know , " said Harry . " But - " 
" Good , I think we just have to forget about what you saw , " said Hermione firmly . " And now , put your mind and effort into the Authority . " 
Harry was so angry with Hermione that he barely spoke to her the rest of the day , adding a bad day . 
When people talk about the fate of the Death Eaters in the corridors , they laugh at the Gryffindor Quidditch team against the Hufflepuff ; The Slytherins were still hugging and singing " Weasley is our king " , because it was so continuous that Mr. Filch was irritated and declared that they would not be singing in the corridors . 
This week is not as good as it seems . 
Harry receives two more D points in poison - Pharmacy ; It was in a state of tension because Hagrid could be chased and it could not prevent himself from dreaming of him becoming Voldemort - yet he did not mention that to Ron and Hermione ; He did not want to receive further lectures from Hermione . 
He wished , really hoping that it could confide Sirius on its subject matter , but that was really a problem , so he tried to get the idea off his head . 
Unfortunately , even his mind is not a safe place . 
" Get up , Potter . " 
Two weeks after his dream of Rookwood , he found himself kneeling on the floor of Mr. Snape's office , trying to shake his head . 
Once again , Snape reminds him of his recent memories and gets most of the times it was Dudley's and his gang's humiliation in class while in elementary school . 
The last memory , " Snape said . " What is it ? " 
" I do not know , " said Harry in fatigue from head to toe . 
He found it increasingly difficult to get out of the confused sounds and images Snape kept calling back . " Do you mean it's my cousin trying to lock me up in the toilet ? 
" 
" No , " Snape said softly . " I mean the memory of a man kneeling in a dark room ... " 
" Nothing ... nothing , " said Harry . 
Snape's dark eyes glinted at Harry . 
Recalling what Snape had said about her role in the Legilimency spell , Harry blinked and looked away . 
" How did that guy and that room come to mind , Potter , " Snape said . 
" It ... 
" Said Harry , looking around except for Snape , " It's ... just a dream for me . " 
" A dream ? " Snape repeated . 
A brief pause and Harry stared at a large dead toad hanging in a vial of purple liquid . 
" Do you know why we're here , Potter ? " Snape shrieked in a whisper . " Do you know why we have to spend the evening doing this boring job ? " 
" Yes , " said Harry hardly . 
" Remind me why we're here , Potter . " 
" So that I can learn the Escuela , " said Harry , now looking at the dead eel . 
" Exactly , Potter . 
And yet you are less intelligent - " Harry looked back at Snape , hating him " - I think that after more than two months of learning , you also have to make some progress . 
How many dreams of the Dark Lord yet ? 
" Only one , " Harry lied . 
" Maybe , " Snape said as his cold eyes narrowed to Harry , " maybe you really enjoyed the illusion and the dream , Potter ? 
Maybe they feel special - important ? 
" No , no , " said Harry , his jaw clenched and his fingers held onto the wand . 
" That's good , Potter , " Snape said coldly , " because you're not special or important , and you do not even need to discover that the Dark Lord is talking to the Deathly Hallows . What is his real life ? 
" 
" No ... that's your job , right ? " Harry asked him bluntly . 
It was not thinking about words ; That made Snape burst . 
After a long pause they looked at each other , Harry believed that it had gone too far . 
But it was strange , as if he seemed pleased when he replied . 
" Oh , Potter , " he said , his eyes flashing . that is my job . 
Now , if you're ready , then we ' ll start again . 
" 
He raised his wand to : " One - two - three - Legilimens " 
One hundred Dementors were hurrying toward Harry across the lake of the land ... it was looking up . 
They are coming closer ... 
He could see the black spots under their hoods ... but he also saw Snape standing in front of him , staring at him , murmuring in his breath ... and Somehow , Snape became more and more apparent , and the Dementors became more and more weak ... 
Harry held up his wand . 
" Protego " 
Snape staggered - his wand thrown away from Harry - and suddenly Harry's mind came out of his mind : A man with a nose was yelling at a shaking woman , while a little girl was shivering . Black is crying at another corner ... 
Then a fat man was alone in a darkened bedroom , pointing his wand to the ceiling , and then a broomstick flew straight ... the girl laughed as the little boy struggled try to climb the brush - 
" enough ! " 
Harry felt as if he had just been pushed into his chest ; She stepped back a few steps , hit a hanging shelf on the wall and heard something crackling . 
Snape was trembling , his face white . 
Behind Harry's drenched coat . 
One of the jars behind it broke when it fell ; The mucus inside is flowing out of the vase . 
" Reparo , " snapped Snape , and the jar sealed itself immediately . 
Very well , Potter ... has made a lot of progress ... " A little gasp , Snape was about to stack some potions of poison to have time to store some thoughts before starting the lesson , as if old 
Checking them is still there . " I do not remember telling you how to use the Anti - Semitism or ... but I can not doubt its effectiveness ... " 
Harry did not say anything ; It felt as though anything at this time would be very dangerous . It was sure that it had penetrated Snape's memories , as though he had just seen Snape's childhood scene . 
It was not pleasant to think that the little boy wept when he saw his parents quarrel and stood in front of him and looked at him with disgusted eyes . 
" Let's try again ? " Snape said . 
Harry felt a trembling fear ; He prepared to say what had happened . 
They step back to the right place between the tables , Harry felt it would be hard to empty the head at the moment . 
" I will count from one to three , " Snape said , and raised his wand again . " One two ... " 
Harry did not have time to rearrange his memories before Snape screamed , " Legidimens ! " 
She ran along the corridor toward the Secretariat , crossing the stone wall , past the torches . - The black door was becoming more and more clear and larger than ever ; It's moving as fast as it wants to hit the door , it's just a few feet from the door and it can see that light blue glow - The door is already open ! 
In the end it went through the door , inside a circular room with black walls - the black floor was lit with blue candles , and around it had many other doors - it needed to be - but which door should it go in ? 
" POTTER ! " 
Harry opened his eyes , he lay flat on the floor , no memory of what he was , panting as if it really ran along the corridors of the Secret Bureau , the black door and find that round room . 
Explain it ! " Snape was standing in front of him , saying angrily . 
" I ... do not know what happened , " Harry stood up and said honestly . head up a lump in the back where it hits the ground and it feels sore . " I've never seen that before . I mean ... I told you , I dreamed a door but never got in . 
" You were not hard enough ! 
" 
For some reason , Snape looked angry more than two minutes ago , when Harry saw his memory . 
" You are so lazy and sloppy , Potter , it's astonishing to be Dark Lord ... " 
" Can I tell you something ? " Harry said angrily . " Why did you call Voldemort the Dark Lord ? 
I only heard the names of Death - Death - call him like that . 
Snape gasped for a second - and suddenly a woman shouted from somewhere outside the room . 
Snape pushed his head upward ; he stared at the ceiling . 
" What is it ? " He whispered . 
Harry could hear a small shock from where he thought it might be Hall . 
Snape looked around Harry , frowning . " Did you see anything unusual on the way down here , Potter ? " 
Harry shook his head . Somewhere above , the woman screamed again . 
Snape strode out of his office , his wand still clutched in a ready position , and scanned a look . 
Harry hesitated for a moment , then followed . 
Those screams are exactly what came from the Hall , more and more heard as Harry approached the stone wall from Snape's dungeon . 
When it arrived it realized that the Great Hall was full of children ; too many students filled the Hall of Fame , where dinner was still being held , to see what was going on ; Others stoned the marble stairs . 
Harry hurried forward through the high school Slytherins students and noticed that the viewers were standing in a big circle , some of them looking shocked , others even scared . 
Professor McGonagall directly facing it across the Hall ; It seemed as if what she was seeing made her want to get sick . 
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Great Hall with his wand in one hand and a bottle of empty wine in the other , looking completely crazy . 
Her hair is upright , her glasses are deflected , making one eye look bigger than her ; Countless scarves and scarves dragged her from her shoulders , making the impression she had just fallen on the towel . Two large chests lay on the floor beside her , one upside down ; It looked very likely that it had been thrown down the stairs behind her . 
Professor Star Trelawney looked horrified , at something Harry could not see but that seemed to lie at the foot of the stairs . 
" No ! " She hissed . " This can not happen ... it can not ... I can not accept it ! 
" Do not you see that it's coming ? " A squeaky voice said , with a merciless grin , and Harry , slowly moving to the right , found that Professor Trelawney's horror Nothing else but Professor Umbridge . " Even though it was not enough to even predict the weather tomorrow , she must have realized that her performance was poor during my inspection , without any improvement , for sure . Inevitably , you will be fired ! " 
" Madame - can not ! " Professor Trelawney screamed , tears streaming down from behind the large glasses , " You can not fire me ! 
I've been here for 16 years now ! H - Hogwarts is n - my home ! 
" 
" It is still her home , " said Professor Umbridge , and Harry felt a disgust as he saw her delighted expression as he watched Professor Trelawney kneel down on one of the suitcases , sobbing . , " until one hour ago , when the Minister of Magic endorsed her dismissal . 
Now please go out of this hall . 
You are making us difficult . 
" 
But she stood there and watched , with a frown of interest , as Professor Trelawney shivered and moaned , shoved her suitcase and shuffled back in agony . . 
Harry heard the sobbing and moaned to the left and looked around . 
Lavender and Parvati , both hugging each other , whimpering . 
Then he heard footsteps . 
Professor McGonagall sneaked past the audience , headed straight for Professor Trelawney and tried to pant Professor Trelawney while pulling out a large handkerchief from his robes . 
All right , Sybill ... Calm down ... blow your nose ... it's not as bad as you think ... I will not have to leave Hogwarts ... " 
" Oh , really , Professor McGonagall ? " Umbridge said in a cruel voice to the men . " And what rights do you have to say that ... ? " 
" The right to me , " a low voice said . 
The oak door opened . 
The students rushed forward as Dumbledore appeared from the entrance . 
Harry could not tell what he was doing out there , but the scene at the door was impressive , as opposed to the dark scene . 
Leaving the door wide open behind him , he moved forward through the audience and headed for Professor Trelawney , trembling with tears in his chest , Professor McGonagall sitting next to him . 
" In you , Professor Dumbledore ? " Umbridge said in an uncomfortable laugh . 
" I'm here - " She pulled a roll of parchment from inside her robes . " - A decree dismissed by myself personally the Minister of Magic sign . 
Under the terms of the Twenty - Third Executive Education Ordinance , the Hogwart Auditors have the right to inspect , monitor and fire any teacher who does not meet the Department's basic standards . 
I decided that Professor Trelawney would not be working again . 
I fired her . 
Harry felt so surprised , Dumbledore continued to smile . 
He looked down at Professor Trelawney , who was sobbing and choking on his suitcase . " You are right , Professor Umbridge . 
As a Senior Inspector , you have the authority to fire my teachers . 
You have the right to fire them , but certainly do not have the right to evict them from the castle . 
" I'm afraid , " he continued , with a polite bow , still the underlying power of the Rector , " and I really wish that Professor Trelawney would continue living in Hogwarts . " 
At this time , Professor Trelawney laughed a little , her hiccups did not cover it . " No - No , I will ... go , Dumbledore ! 
I will ... 
will ... leave Hogwarts and ... seek his fortune elsewhere - " 
" No , " Dumbledore said firmly . 
" I want you to stay , Sybill . " 
He turned to Professor McGonagall . 
" Can I ask you to take Sybill upstairs , Professor McGonagall ? 
" 
" Of course , " McGonagall said . 
" go up , Sybill ... " 
Professor Sprout rushed out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney's arm . 
Together they crossed Umbridge's face and walked up the marble steps . 
Professor Flitwick rushed behind them , his wand stretched out in front of him ; He whispered , " Where are you ? " And Trelawney's pink chests were lifted up in the air and up the stairs , Professor Flitwick followed . 
Professor Umbridge was standing motionless , staring at Dumbledore , still smiling kindly . " And then , " she said , while the Great Hall was rumbling , " What would you do with her if I was going to appoint a new Teacher ? " 
" Oh , nothing , " said Dumbledore excitedly . " You see , I found a new prophet , and he would like to be in that hut . " 
" Did you find ... ? " Umbridge hissed . " He found .. ? 
Let me repeat , Dumbledore , the Twenty - Second Education Decree ... " The department has the right to nominate a suitable person - when and only if - the principal can not find a substitute , " said Dumbledore . . " And I'm very happy to say that this time I was successful . 
Can I introduce you ? 
He turned toward the open door , through the misty drift . 
Harry heard the hoofs . 
Around the Great Hall there were the whispered words , and the people in the vicinity rushed back , some of them hurrying aside to pay off the path for the newcomer . 
Throughout the fog , a face that Harry had seen once in the dark and dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest : golden hair and blue eyes ; The head and body of a person are connected to the body of a horse with a golden mane 
" Firenze , " said Dumbledore pleasantly while Umbridge was shocked . 
" I think you will find him very suitable for this position . " 
CHAPTER 27 : HUMAN BEINGS AND ARMS 
" I bet you now wish you had not dropped the Prophet , would you , Hermione ? " Parvati asked with a laugh . At breakfast , two days after the dismissal of Professor Trelawney , Parvati was bending his eyelashes with a wand and checking the results on the back of the spoon . 
They will have their first lesson with Firenze this morning . " Not really , " said Hermione indifferently , reading the Daily Prophet . " I really never really liked horses . " She turned to another page and skimmed through the sections . " He's not a horse , he's a centaur ! " Lavender said , sounding rather shocked . " A beautiful centaur ... " Parvati sighed . " In other words , there are still four legs , " said Hermione blandly . " Anyway , I think you two are upset because Miss Trelawney has gone , right ? " " Oh , yes ! " Lavender assured him . " We went to the office to see her , and we brought her some daffodils - not the crocuses like Sprout's car whistle , but the beautiful ones . " " How is she ? " Asked Harry . " Not very well , poor , " Lavender said sympathetically . " She cried and said that she would rather leave the castle than stay with Umbridge , and I would not blame her , because Umbridge had treated her so horribly , did not she ? " Umbridge just started to become horrible , " said Hermione brightly . " It can not be , " said Ron , eating a plate of eggs and large bacon . " She can not be worse than now . " " Remember her , she would want to get revenge on Dumbledore because he had appointed a new teacher without discussing with her . " Hermione said the newspaper . " Especially one half - man . 
You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . " After breakfast Hermione left for her arithmetic class when Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the Great Hall , going to the Prophet's classroom . " Do not we go up to the North Tower ? " Ron asked , looking puzzled as Parvati walked around the marble stairs . 
Parvanti looked at Ron in disdain over her shoulder . " How do you expect Firenze to climb that ladder ? 
Now that we're in the eleventh room , it was announced on the board yesterday . " Classroom 11 is located on the ground floor along the corridor . Entrance to the hall from the other side to the Great Hall . 
Harry knew that it was one of the less frequently used classrooms , and so it felt a little like a cupboard or a shed . 
When it came right behind Ron , and found himself in the middle of an empty forest , he was amazed at the moment . " What - " " The classroom has become moss - covered and the trees are blooming out there , the branches stretch out across the ceiling and windows , making the room full of tinted rays . Green , soft and mottled . 
The students who were in the classroom were sitting on a bare floor , leaning back against a tree or boulders , arms wrapped around their knees or chained to their chest . 
They all look quite stressful . 
Between the forest , where there is no 
The tree is Firenze . " Harry Potter , " he said , raising his hand as Harry came in . " Oh - hello , " said Harry , shaking hands with the centenary , who was staring at him with amazed blue eyes but not smiling . " Oh - nice to meet you . " " And you . " The centenary said , bending down the golden head . " It was anticipated that we would meet again . " Harry realized that there was a hoar - shaped bruise on Firenze's chest . 
When it came back to join the rest of the class , he saw all of them are looking up at him in fear , as if deeply impressed that he had dared to speak to Firenze , whom they seemed to see very well . frighteningly 
When the door was closed and the students finally sat on a tree next to a paper basket , Firenze signaled around the classroom . " Professor Dumbledore was kind enough to arrange this class for us , " Firenze said , as all the students sat down . " in the simulation of my natural habitat . 
I really like teaching in the Forbidden Forest , where - until Monday - is my home ... but now it can not be . "" Dear teacher , " Parvati breathlessly said , raising her hand . " Why not ? We are still learning with Hagrid , we are not afraid of anything ! "" It's not a question of courage , " Firenze said . " But in my opinion , I can not go back to the Forest . 
The herds deported me . " " Herd ? " Lavender said in a confused voice , and Harry knew she was thinking of the cows . " What - oh ! " The sensation flashed on her face . " There were many people like him . " She said , quite shocked . " Did Hagrid nourish you , like the Thieves ? " Asked Dean eagerly . 
Firenze slowly turned his head to face Dean , who seemed to realize that he had said something very offensive . " I do not - I mean - I'm sorry . " It ended in a low voice . " Centaur is not a human servant or a toy , " Firenze said quietly . 
There was a pause , and then Parvati raised her hand again . " Teacher ... Why are other centaurs deporting me ? " " Because I agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore , " Firenze said . " They see it as a betrayal of their fellow human beings , " recalled Harry . Nearly four years ago , the centurion Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride on his back ; He had called Firenze a " trivial mule " . 
He wondered if Bane was the one who kicked Firenze's chest . " Let's get started , " Firenze said . 
He threw his bright long - haired tail , waved his wand toward the dense glass of his head , then slowly lowered it , and as he did , the light in the room dimmed , making them now sitting in a forest at dusk , and stars glittering in the ceiling . 
There were muffled breaths and Ron gasped and Ron spoke clearly . 
" Oh ! " " All lie down , " said Firenze softly . " and observe the sky . 
It has been written down , for those who can see , our destiny . " Harry stretched his back and stared up at the ceiling . 
A glittering red star flickered at him from above . " I know that you learned the names of the planets and their moons in astronomy . " Firenze's soft voice rose . " and the game has drawn the journey of the stars across the sky . 
Centaurs have shed light on the secrets of these movements over the centuries . 
Our discovery teaches us that the future can glimpse the sky - "" Professor Trelawney teaches us astrology ! " Parvati excitedly said , raising her hands forward so that it caught up in the air when she lay down . " Mars caused the accident and burned and some of that , and it created a corner with Sao . Turkey , as it is now - " She depicts a square corner above it . " - That means people need to be more careful when handling hot items - "" That , " Firenze said quietly . of human . " Parvati's wrinkly arms fell . " The wounds were negligible , the tiny accidents , " Firenze said , as his claw fell on the moss covered floor . " That's no more meaning . is an ant colony running to the vast universe , and not affected by the movement of the planet . "" Professor Trelawney - " Parvati started , voice hurt and indignant . " - is a human . " Firenze simply said . " And so it was concealed and bound by human limitations . " Harry turned his head slightly at Parvati . 
She looked very offended , as well as some people around her . " Sybill Trelawney can be seen , I do not know . " Firenze continued , and Harry heard his whip again as he went up and down next to them . " But she is wasting her time , in what is , on the ridiculous self - praiseworthy word that humankind calls divination . 
However , I am here to explain the wisdom of centuries , the objectivity and justice . 
We watched the sky for the big bad things or the occasional change that was pointed out there . 
We may have to take years to be certain what we are seeing . " Firenze points at the red star just above Harry . " In the last decade , the signs that witches are living through are nothing more than a short period of peace between the two wars . 
Mars , the one who caused the war , shone brightly on our heads , alluding to the war that will soon erupt again . 
How early , centaurs can try to predict by the burning of special herbs and leaves ; By the observation of fire and smoke ... " That was the most special lesson Harry had ever attended . 
They burned the sage and the mallow on the classroom floor , and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the spicy smoke , but it seemed as if he did not care at all . Some of them can see any signs that he describes , and tells them that humans are hardly good at it , that centaurs take years and years to become proficient , and that they Stop by telling them that anyway , it's foolish to put so much faith in such things , because even centipedes sometimes misread them . 
He was not like any teacher Harry ever had . 
It seems that his advantage is not to teach them the things he knows , but to actually print them in that nothing , regardless of the centenary , is credible . " He's not too sure about anything , is he ? " Ron said softly , as they extinguished the flaming mantle of sweet moss . " I mean , I can do with a bit more detail about the war we will have , right ? " The bell rang outside the classroom and the class jumped ; Harry completely forgot they were still in the castle , and really believed that he was in the Forest . 
The bonding layer 
tear each other out , looks a bit confused . 
Harry and Ron are starting to follow the other students , Firenze calls back . " Harry Potter , one word . " Harry turned around . 
The centaurs slightly approached him . 
Ron hesitated . " The game may linger . " Firenze said to him . " But please close the door . " Ron rushed to follow . " Harry Potter , you're Hagrid's friend , are not you ? " The centaur said . " Yes , " said Harry . " Then help me send him a warning . 
His efforts did not work . 
He's better off than leaving it . " His efforts did not work ? " Harry repeated blankly . " And he was better off than leaving it . " I should have warned Hagrid myself , but I was deported - so it would be stupid if I was too close to the Forest - Hagrid had enough trouble without an additional battle . of the centimeters anymore . " But - what is Hagrid trying to do ? " Harry asked nervously . 
Firenze calmly looked at Harry . " Hagrid recently helped me a lot , " Firenze said . " And he has earned my respect for so long since taking care of all the living things he has pointed out . 
I will not be able to reveal his secret . 
But he must know the right thing . 
The effort does not work . 
Tell him so , Harry Potter . 
A good day . " * The joy Harry felt in the results of the interview with The Feelers was long gone . 
When the March of Gray stormed the stormy April blizzard , its life seemed to once again become a long day's chain of anxiety and filled with problems . 
Umbridge continues to participate in all the Curious Biology classes , so it's really hard to pass the Firenze warning to Hagrid . 
Finally , Harry successfully pretended to have lost the copy of The Amazing Beasts and found them , and ran back after school one day . 
When it repeats Firenze's words , Hagrid stares at it for a moment through his swollen , dark eyes , apparently slightly backing away . 
Then he seemed to regain his composure . " The guy is pretty , Firenze , " he said brusquely . " But he did not know what he was talking about . 
The effort is going very well . "" Hagrid , what are you planning ? " Because he had to be careful , Umbridge had sacked Trelawney and , if he asked me , she was on a document . 
If you are doing anything you should not do , you will be - "" There are more important things than keeping a job . " Hagrid said , though his hands were a little shaky as he spoke , and a tub filled with Knarl chickens hit the ground . " Do not worry about me , Harry , that nice . " Harry had to leave Hagrid's collection of unclean dungeons on his own , but he felt completely depressed as he walked back to the castle . 
In the meantime , when the teachers and Hermione persistently reminded them , the Commonwealth Exams are getting closer . 
All the fifth - graders were in agony , but Hannah Abbott was the first to receive a calm dose from Mrs. Pomfrey after she cried in her gut and complained that she Too ignorant to do the test and want to leave school now . 
If it was not for the DA lessons , Harry thought it would be extremely sad . 
Sometimes he felt he was living for hours in the Room 
Asking , working hard but enjoying all at the same time , stretched proudly as she looked around at the DA team members and looked at how far they had progressed . 
Indeed , Harry occasionally wondered how Umbridge would react when all of the DA team members achieved the " Oustanding " score on the regular anti - art exam . 
They finally learn the Patronus , which everyone seems to enjoy doing , though , as Harry continues to remind them , creating a Patronus in the middle of the room illuminated . When they are not threatened , it is more difficult to create it when faced with something like a Dementor . " Oh , do not be such a mess , " she said , gazing at the Silver Swan's Patronus soaring around the Room of Requirement in their last lesson before the Feast . Easter . " They are so beautiful ! " " They do not have to be beautiful , they need to protect you , " said Harry patiently . " What we really need is a guy or something , that's how I learned , I have to call up a Patronus while he pretends to be a Dementor - " " But That would be scary ! " Lavender said , and she was shooting silver vapor out of her wand . " And I still - can not - create it ! " she said angrily . 
Neville is also in trouble . 
His face narrowed to focus , but only the thin silver smoke escaped from his wand's head . " You need to think of something happy . " Harry reminded him . " I'm trying , " Neville said miserably , he was trying his best , his round face glowing with sweat . " Harry , I think I'm doing it ! " Seamus yelled , it was taken to his first DA meeting today by Dean . " Look at this - ahh - it's gone ... but it's definitely something hairy , Harry ! " Hermione's Patronus , a shining silver otter , was playing around her . little . " They are pretty nice , are not they ? " She said , looking at him affectionately . 
The door to the room opens , then closes . 
Harry looked around to see who had just entered , but no one seemed to be there . 
A moment before he realized that the door was closed silently . The next thing he knew , something was tugging at his cloak near his knee . 
He looked down and saw , suprisingly , Dobby the elf staring at Harry from beneath his usual eight hats . " Hi , Dobby ! " Said Harry . " What are you doing ? " The elf's eyes widened in fear and it was shaking . 
The DA team members closest to Harry fell silent ; Everyone in the room was looking at Dobby . 
Some of the Guardians who had called were gradually disappearing into silver mist , leaving the room darker than before . " Harry Potter , you ... " The elf shrieked , shaking from head to toe . " Harry Potter , Sir .... Dobby came to warn you ... but the other elders did not say ... " He ran to his head against the wall . 
Harry , having had some experience with Dobby's self - punishment habits , had to grab it , but Dobby simply jumped off the stone wall , matted by his eight hats . 
Hermione and several other girls emit hisses of fear and compassion . " What is it , Dobby ? " Harry asked , grabbing the little elf's elbow and keeping it from anything he could hurt himself . 
" Harry Potter ... he ... she ... " Dobby punched his fist in the nose . 
Harry also grabbed it . " Who is she , Dobby ? " But Harry thought he knew ; Is it possible that only " she " could make Dobby so scared ? The goblin looked up at Harry , slightly caught his eye , and speechless . " Umbridge ? " Asked Harry frantically . 
Dobby nodded , then tried to knock his head against Harry's knee . 
Harry holds it by the arm length . " What about her ? 
Dobby - Did she not find out about this yet - about us - about the DA team ? " Harry read the answer on the elf's frightened face . 
Hand held firmly by Harry , the elf tries to kick himself and fall to the floor . " She's coming ? " Harry asked quietly . 
Dobby made a scream , and started stomping his feet on the ground . " Yes , Harry , yes ! " Harry stood up straight and looked around , motionless , staring at the self - defeating elf . " What are you up to ? " Harry growled . " RUN ! " All of the legs on the neck ran to the exit immediately , creating a big mess in the door , then rushed out . 
Harry could hear their rushed footsteps along the corridor and hoped no one would try to run all the way home . It's ten o ' clock , if they can hide in the library or nests , both are closer . " Harry , let's go ! " Cried Hermione from the group of scrambled people to escape . " Dobby - this is an order - go back to the kitchen with the other elves and , if she asks if you told me , lie is not ! " Said Harry . " And I forbid you to torture yourself ! " He added , releasing the elf when it finally crossed the threshold and slammed the door behind him . " Thanks , Harry Potter ! " Dobby shrieked , and it shot away . 
Harry glances to his left and right , the others are running fast , he can only see his heels flying through the end of the corridor before they disappear . 
Harry started running to the right ; There is a male toilet in front that pretends to be in it all the time as long as it can reach it - " Aaargh ! " There was something catching Harry's ankles and it fell a spectacular one , flipped forward six feet before stopping . 
Someone behind him was smiling grimly . 
She rolled her back and saw Malfoy hiding in an alcove beneath a terrible dragon - shaped vase . " Bad luck , Potter ! " He said . " Professor ! 
Professor ! 
I caught one ! " Umbridge rushed up from the corner of the house , not breathing , but smiled brightly . " It's here ! " She was delighted to say when she saw Harry on the floor . " Outstanding , Draco , excellent , oh , good - 50 points for the Slytherin ! 
I ' ll take it now ... stand up , Potter ! " Harry stood up , looking angry at both of them . 
It never looked so happy to Umbrige . 
She grabbed her arm and held it like a beak and turned away , beaming with Malfoy . " Run along and find out if you can catch any more , Draco , " she said . " Tell the other guys to look in the library - anybody panting 
" Examining the restroom too , Miss Parkinson can be found in the girl's room - the game goes on - and the game , " she said in the most frightening voice , as Malfoy went . " You can go with me . Office of the Principal , Potter . " They are in stone mouth for a few minutes . 
Harry wondered how many of them had been arrested . 
He thought to Ron - Mrs. Weasley would kill her - and how would Hermione feel if she was kicked out of school before taking the regular exam . 
And that was Seamus's first meeting ... and Neville was a lot better ... 
" Fizzing Whizzbee " Umbridge singing ; the jaw jumped to one side , the wall behind it split open , and they climbed up the stone stairs automatically . 
They reached for the elegant door knocking on the door of the lion's head , but Umbridge did not even knock , she strode inside , still holding Harry . 
The room was full of people . 
Dumbledore was sitting behind the table , his face calm , his hands clenched . 
Professor McGonagall stood firmly beside her , her face extremely tense . 
Cornelius Fudge , Minister of Magic , is rocking his toes by the flames , looking extremely satisfied with the situation , Kingsley Shacklebolt and a very wicked sorcerer with coarse and twisted short hair . not knowing , standing by the door like a guard , and the glistening figure of Percy Weasley delighted in the wall , in his hand with a brush , and a roll of goatskin , readily available . 
The portraits of the principals no longer pretend to sleep tonight . 
They all looked very serious and alert , watching what was going on below . 
As Harry walked in , a few flew to the next picture and whispered in ear . 
Harry jerked his arms out of Umbridge as the door swung shut behind him . 
Cornelius Fudge was staring at it with the ugly gratification on his face . " Good , " he said . " Good , good , good ... " Harry responded with the most hateful look he could make . 
Its heart was pounding furiously inside , but its brain remained calm and strangely clear . " She's on her way back to Gryffindor Tower , " Umbridge said . 
There was a fascination attached to her voice , and the heartless pleasure of watching Professor Trelawney froze in the Hall . " The Malfoy boy put that on the wall . " " Oh , really ? " Fudge said commendably . " I have to remember to tell Lucius . 
Oh , Potter ... I suppose you know why you're here ? " Harry was determined to answer " yes " stubbornly : his mouth opened and the word came out halfway , and he caught Dumbledore's face . 
Dumbledore did not look directly at Harry - his eyes focused on a point on his shoulder - but as Harry stared at him , he shook his head a inch . 
Harry changed immediately . " No - no . " " What ? " Asked Fudge . " No , " said Harry firmly . " You do not know why you're here ? " " Yes , no , " said Harry . 
Fudge looked skeptically from Harry to Professor Dumbledore . 
Harry enlisted the moment he did not pay attention to the fast peek at Dumbledore , who nodded to him a little and the ball of winking . " So you have no idea , " Fudge said , his tone completely sinking with sarcasm . " Why does Professor Umbridge bring you to this office ? 
He did not realize that he was 
Violation of any school rules ah ? " School rules ? " Said Harry , " no . " Or the Decree of the Ministry of Magic ? " Fudge frowned . " I do not see that . " Harry said quietly . 
His heart was pounding so fast . 
It is worth mentioning these lies to see Fudge's blood pressure increase , but it can not understand how it could get rid of them . 
If someone had warned about the DA team with Umbridge then it would be best to pack the luggage right now . " So , that's news for you , is not it ? " Fudge said , his tone now angry . " Yes , new information , " said Harry , giving a look of innocent , innocent surprise on his face . " I think , Minister , " said Umbridge sweetly beside him . " We can learn more if I get the news provider out . " " Yes , yes , do it . " Fudge nodded , and he glanced at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room . . " There is nothing better than a witness , is it , Mr. Dumbledore ? " " Absolutely nothing , Cornelius , " said Dumbledore , bowing slightly down . 
All waited for a few minutes , nobody looked at anyone , then Harry heard the door open behind him . 
Umbridge walks past it into the room , clutching Cho's curly - haired girlfriend , Marietta , now in her arms . " Do not be afraid , dear , do not be afraid , " Professor Umbridge said sweetly , patting her on the back . " It's all right now . 
You did a very right thing . 
The minister was very pleased with his son . 
She would tell her mother that she was a good girl . 
Marietta , Minister , " she said , adding , " It was Mrs. Edgecombe from the Transportation Office , Floo System - she helped us control the flames of Howgart College . You know that . "" Good , good ! " Fudge said warmly . " Which mother did you have ? 
Oh , come on , baby , do not be embarrassed , let's hear what we have - let go ! " As Marietta raised her head , Fudge jumped backwards in shock , almost falling into the fire . 
He cursed and stomped on the edge of the cloak , where it began to smoke . 
Marietta wailed and pulled her cloak up to her eyes , but everyone could see her horrified face with a series of pimples peering across her nose and cheeks forming the word " The accusers . " Do not worry , " Umbridge said impatiently . " Just put off your coat and tell the Minister - " But Marietta made a cackle of muffled cries and shook his head like mad . " Oh , okay , silly girl , I ' ll tell him , " Umbridge interrupted . 
She again began to smile and said , " Well , Minister , Miss Edgecombe came to my office not long after dinner and told me she has something to tell me . 
She said that if I go to a secret room on the 7 th floor , known as the Request Room , I will discover something of benefit . 
I asked her a bit more and she admitted that there were several types of meetings there . Unfortunately , this spell , " she waved impatiently at Marietta's covered face , " began to pop up and when she saw her face in the mirror , she became too scared and did not say a word . more for me "" Well , now , " said Fudge , looking at Marietta with a determined effort to look like a fatherly , friendly look . " I'm very much like you , dear , " said Professor Umbridge . 
You have done the right thing . 
Now , can you tell me what's going on in the meeting ? 
What is its purpose ? And who was there ? " But Marietta did not say anything , she simply shook her head again , her eyes wide open with fear . " We do not have a talisman ? " Fudge impatiently asked Umbridge , pointing at Marietta's face . " So she's comfortable speaking ? " I have not found one yet . " Umbridge was reluctant to admit , and Harry was overwhelmed with pride in Hermione's enchantment . " But no matter what she does not say , I can continue the story here . " Do you remember , Minister , I sent you a report in October that Potter met some of the students at the Hogsmead Pub - " " And what is your proof ? " I have evidence from the Willy Widdershins , Minerva , who was in the bar at the time . 
He was tightly packed , really , but his hearing was still exactly right , " Umbridge said . " He heard every word Potter said and hurried to school to tell me - " Oh , that's why he was prosecuted for putting up all the vomit up ! " Professor McGonagall said , raising an eyebrow . " What an interesting clarity in our legal system ! " Corruption is obvious ! " The wicked wizard's nostrils on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk roared . " The Ministry did not cut off the treatment of my good prisoners , sir , they did not ! " Thanks , Fortescue , that would be useful . " Dumbledore said gently . " The purpose of Potter's meeting with these students . " Professor Umbridge continued , " was to persuade them to join an illegal association , whose purpose was to learn mantras and curse . The Ministry of Magic decided that it was not appropriate for school age - "" I think the professor was wrong here , Dolores , " Dumbledore said quietly , staring at her through the open moonlight on the bridge of his nose . 
Harry stared at him . 
He could not understand how Dumbledore would take it out of this ; If the Willy Widdershins had actually listened to every word in the pub , there would simply be no way out . " Oh ! " Fudge said , shrugging and shrugging down on his leg . " So , listen to the latest fabricated story created to get Harry out of trouble ! 
Come on , come on . 
Dumbledore , tell me - Willy Widdershins is lying , right ? 
Or was it Harry's twin brother at the pub that day ? 
Or is there a simple explanation as to what is involved in the reversal of time , a dead man and a pair of invisible deities ? " Percy Weasley laughed heartily . " Oh , good , Minister , is that so ? " Harry just wanted to kick it . 
Then he was surprised to see Dumbledore smiling softly . " Cornelius , I do not deny - and I'm sure Harry is the same - that he was in that tavern that day , nor did he deny that he was trying to recruit more students into the Black Arts Defense team . possessed . 
I simply want to point out that Dolores was wrong to imply that such a group at that time was illegal . 
If you remember , the Ministry's decree banned all student associations from being valid until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting , so it did not violate any of the rules . in the Alcoholic . 
Percy looked as if he had just been hit by a heavy object in the face . 
Fudge stood still in the middle of the shrug , his mouth wide open . 
Umbridge calmed down first : " It's okay , Principal , " she said sweetly . " But now we are almost six months after the promulgation of Education Decree No . 22 . 
If the first meeting is not illegal , then all subsequent meetings are of course illegal . "" Well , " said Dumbledore , looking closely at her interest in the top of her knit fingers . " Of course , if they continued after the decree went into effect . 
Do you have proof that any such meeting has continued ? " As Dumbledore said , Harry heard a rustle on his back and thought that Kingsley was whispering something . 
It can also swear that it feels something touching the flanks , something as soft as a breeze or a bird's wing , but when looking down it does not see anything . " Evidence ? " Umbridge repeated with a terrible grin like a toad . " Do not you listen , Dumbledore ? 
What do you think Miss Edgecombe is here for ? " Oh , can you tell us about the six months of meetings ? " Dumbledore raised his eyebrows and said , " I have the impression that he just narrated the meeting tonight . "" Miss Edgecombe . " Umbridge said at once . " Tell us how long these meetings have lasted , dear . 
You just nod or shake your head , I'm sure the notes will not get worse . Have these meetings been held regularly over the past six months ? " Harry felt a horrible feeling in his stomach . 
It was that , they hit the road with hard evidence , even Dumbledore could not put aside . " Just nod or shake your head , dear , " Umbridge said sweetly to Marietta . " Say what , darling , it will not activate the spell . " Everyone in the room looked at Marietta's face . 
Only her eyes popped between her cloak and her curly hair . 
Maybe it was the light of the fire , but her eyes looked oddly blank . 
And then - with Harry's utter shock - Marietta shook her head . 
Umbridge glanced to Fudge , then looked back at Marietta . " I do not think you understand the question , are you , dear ? 
I'm asking if you have gone to meetings in the last six months ? 
I have gone , right ? " Again , Marietta shook her head . " What do you mean , darling ? " Umbridge snapped . " I think the meaning of that game is pretty obvious . " Professor McGonagall said harshly . " There has been no secret meeting in the last six months . 
Are not you , Miss Edgecombe ? " Marietta nodded . " But there was a meeting tonight ! " Umbridge said angrily . " There was a meeting tonight , Miss Edgecombe , she told me so , in Request Room ! 
And Potter is the lead , is not it , Potter founded it , Potter - why did she shake her head , girl ? " Well , usually when a person shakes his head , " said Professor McGonagall coldly . " They mean 
" are not " ; So unless Miss Edgecombe is using an unknown human sign language - " Professor Umbridge grabbed Marietta , turned her around , and started shaking her very hard . 
Half a second after Dumbledore got up , his wand rose ; Kingsley moved forward and Umbridge jumped back from Marietta , waving his arms in the air as though they had been burned . " I can not allow the trainer to be abusive to my student , Dolores , " said Dumbledore and , for the first time , he really looked angry . " Please calm down , Mrs. Umbridge , " Kingsley said in his slow , deep voice . " You do not want to get in trouble . " " No , " Umbridge said breathlessly , looking up at Kingsley's strong figure . " I mean , that's right - he's right , Shacklebolt - I - I've lost my temper . " Marietta was standing where Umbridge had just released her . 
She seemed not to be afraid of Umbridge's sudden attack , nor was she relieved to be released ; She still clasped her gaze up to her eyes and stared up at him . 
A sudden suspicion , linked to Kingsley's whisper and what it felt to shoot over him , appeared in Harry's mind . " Dolores , " Fudge said , with the air trying to settle for something decisively , " this dark meeting - which we know for sure is out - " " Yes , " Umbridge said , calming down . . 
" Yes ... hello ... Miss Edgecombe warned me and I went to the seventh floor right away , accompanied the trustworthy students , to catch the ball in the meeting . 
However , they seemed to have been told I was coming , because when we reached the floor , they were all running in all directions . 
However , it does not matter . 
I have all these names here , Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement to find out if they had left anything . 
We need evidence and the room provided . " And with Harry's dread , she pulled out a list of pinned members on the Wall of Requirement Room and handed it to Fudge . " The moment I saw Potter on the list , I knew . What are we dealing with ? " She said softly . " Excellent . " Fudge said , smiles wide on the face . " Excellent , Dolores . 
And ... I'm ... " He looked up at Dumbledore , who was still standing next to Marietta , his loose wand in his hand . " What are they naming ? " Fudge said quietly . " Dumbledore's army . " Dumbledore reached over and took the goatskin from Fudge . 
He stared at the title scrawled by Hermione several months ago and for a moment seemed unable to speak . 
Then he looked up , smiling . " Good , the game is over , " she said simply . " Do you want a confession from me , Cornelius - or is a statement to these witnesses enough ? " Harry saw Professor McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other . 
There is fear on both faces . 
He did not understand what was going on , and it seemed that Fudge was the same . " Statement ? " Fudge said slowly . " What - I do not - ? " " Dumbledore's army , Cornelius , " Dumbledore said , still smiling as he waved the list in front of Fudge . " Not Potter's army . 
Dumbledore's army . " But - but - " 
Fudge's sudden burning sensation froze . 
He stepped back scared , exclaimed , and jumped out of the fire again . " You ? " Fudge whispered , stomping on his cloak . " That's right , " Dumbledore said cheerfully . " You founded this ? " " It's me , " said Dumbledore . " You recruit students for - for your army ? " " Tonight is the first meeting , " Dumbledore nodded . " Simply to see if they are interested in joining me . 
Of course , I now find it very wrong to invite Miss Edgecombe . " Marietta nodded . 
Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore , her chest swelling . " So you're plotting against me ! " He exclaimed . " That's right , " said Dumbledore excitedly . " No ! " Screamed Harry . 
Kingsley flashed a warning look at her , and McGonagall widened her terrified eyes , but it suddenly appeared to Harry what Dumbledore was planning to do , and she could not let that happen . " No - Professor Dumbledore - ! " " Quiet , Harry , or I'm afraid you ' ll have to leave my office , " Dumbledore said calmly . " Right , shut up , Potter ! " Fudge barked , who was still staring at Dumbledore with terrifying pleasure . " Good , good , good - I came here this evening planning to expel Harry and instead - " " Instead he caught me , " said Dumbledore , still smiling . " As if losing a knut and finding a Galleon , would not it ? " " Weasley ! " Fudge shouted , now clearly shaking with joy . " Weasley , did you burn it all , everything he said , confession , was it all gone ? " " Yes , sir , I think it's all there , sir ! " Said Percy eagerly . It sticks to ink from the speed of its recording . " Does he try to build up a military against the Ministry of Magic and work to destabilize me ? " " Yes , sir , it's over now , enough , " Percy said , skimming over the words . write delightfully . " Very good , " Fudge said , his face glowing with joy . " Take another copy , Weasley , and send a copy to the Daily Prophet right away . 
If we send a quick owl we can publish it tomorrow ! " Percy dashed out of the room , slamming the door behind him , and Fudge turned to look at Dumbledore . " He will now be escorted to the Ministry of Magic , where he will be formally charged , and then sent . to Azkaban wait until the trial ! "" Well , " said Dumbledore kindly . " Yes , I think we can make it a little bit miffed . " " Malfunction ? " Fudge said , his voice still beating with joy . " I do not see any trouble , Dumbledore ! "" Oh , " said Dumbledore , " I'm afraid I see . " Oh , really ? " Well - you seem to be just under the illusion that I'm going to - say how ? 
- walk silently . 
I'm afraid I will not go quiet at all , Cornelius . 
I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban . 
Of course I can 
Escaping - but it's a waste of time , and actually I can think of a lot of things I should do . " Umbridge's face became reddened , and she looked as if she was filled with hot water . 
Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very stupid face ; as if he had just been hit by a sudden blow and could not believe it had happened . 
He gave a small stuffy nose , then looked around at Kingsley and the man with the short gray hair , the only one in the room , was still completely silent until now . 
He nodded to Fudge and moved forward a little , separating from the wall . 
Harry saw his hands stretch , almost casually , towards his pocket . " Do not be silly , Dawlish , " Dumbledore said softly . " I'm sure you are an excellent Spirit - I just remember you got the " Oustanding " score on all the regular exams - but if you try to - oh - give me By the force , we will have to hurt you . " The man named Dawlish blinked quite stupidly . 
He looked back at Fudge , but this time he seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next . " Then , " Fudge snickered , calm down . " Are you aiming for a single piece of code against Dawlish , Shacklebolt , Dolores and me , Dumbledore ? " " Oh , no , " Dumbledore said with a smile . " Not unless you're too stupid to make me do it . " " He's not going to be alone , " Professor McGonagall said loudly , reaching into his pocket . " He ' ll be there , Minerva ! " Dumbledore said firmly . " Hogwarts need a professor ! " " That's enough of it ! " Fudge said , pulling his wand out . " Dawlissh ! 
Shacklebolt ! 
Get him ! " There was a blur of silver flashing around the room , a blast of gunfire and the floor shaking , a hand grabbing Harry's neck and dropping it to the floor as the second silver light disappeared . Some portraits scream , Fawkes chirps and a cloud of dust pervades the space . 
Coughing in the dust , Harry saw a dark shadow on the floor with a croak right in front of him ; There were screams and croaking and somebody was crying . " No ! " , And then the broken glass , the screams , the moans ... ... and the silence . 
Harry tried to walk around to see who had nearly stifled it and saw Professor McGonagall hiding next to it . 
She pulled him and Marietta out of danger . 
Dust still floats down through the air . 
Gasped , Harry saw a very tall figure approaching them . " Are you all right ? " Dumbledore asked . " Yes ! " Professor McGonagall said , sitting up and pulling Harry and Marietta back to her . 
The dust brightens . 
The desolate scene of the room looms in sight : Dumbledore's table was overturned , their silver tools shattered . 
Fudge , Umbridge , Kingsley and Dawlish lie motionless on the floor . 
The phoenixes Fawkes soared up the circle above them , singing softly . Unfortunately , I have to deal with Kingsley , otherwise it will be very suspicious , " said Dumbledore . " He's smart , " Changmin said , as they all looked away - thank you for me , okay , Minerva ? "" Now , they're all going to be early . They woke up and at best they did not know that we had time to talk - everyone had to act as though no moment had passed , as if all of them were just hit the floor , they would not . remember - " 
" Where are you going , Dumbledore ? " Professor McGonagall whispered . " Grimmauld Square ? " " Oh , no , " said Dumbledore with a smile . " I will not go anywhere . 
Fudge would soon wish he had not driven me out of Hogwarts , I promise . "" Professor Dumbledore .... " Harry started . 
It does not know what to say first : how to apologize for having set up the first team and causing all this trouble , or how terrible it felt when Dumbledore left to save it from being expulsion ? 
But Dumbledore interrupted before he could say a word . " Listen , Harry , " he said urgently . " You have to learn occlumency with your game , do you understand ? 
Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it regularly every night before bed so that you can hide your mind from bad dreams - you ' ll soon understand why , but you have to promise " The man named Dawlish was moving . 
Dumbledore grabbed Harry's wrist . " Remember - to hide your mind - " But when Dumbledore's fingers touched Harry's skin , a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and it felt once again the intense intense desire . want to attack Dumbledore like a snake , want to bite him , want to hurt him - " - you will understand , " whispered Dumbledore . 
Fawkes flew around the room and swooped down on him . 
Dumbledore released Harry , raised his hand and grasped the long golden tail of the phoenix . 
There was a spark and both disappeared . " Where is he ? " Fudge shouted , pushing him up . " Where is he ? " " I do not know ! " Kingsley shouted as he jumped . " Hmmm , he can not reach Turkey ! " Umbridge yelled . " I can not do that in this school - " " The stairs ! " Dawlish shouted , and he rushed to the door , yanking it open and disappearing , followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge . 
Fudge hesitated , then stood up slowly , dusting off the front lap . 
There was a long , painful silence . " Well , Minerva . " Fudge said disgustingly , pulling his torn shirt up . " I'm afraid this is the ending for my dumbledore friend . " " You think so , do not you ? " Professor McGonagall said contemptuously . 
Fudge did not seem to hear her . 
He was looking around the deserted room . 
Some portrays whistled at him ; One or two people still make angry gestures . " It's better to have these two go to bed , " Fudge said , looking back at Professor McGonagall with a rough nod at Harry and Marietta . 
Professor McGonagall did not say anything , but led Harry and Marietta out the door . 
When it closed behind them , Harry heard the voice of Phineas Nigellus . " You know , Minister , I do not agree with Dumbledore in a lot of places , but I can not deny that he has an attitude ... " 
CHAPTER 28 : SNAPE's MOST FASTEST MUSIC FESTIVAL 
THE MINISTRY OF THE LEGISLATION 
Dolores Jane Umbridge ( Senior Inspector ) will replace 
Albus Dumbledore is the principal of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . 
The nomination is subject to the Education Act No . 28 . 
Signed : Cornelius Oswald Fudge , Minister of Magic 
The flyers hovered over the school all night , but they did not explain how everyone in the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had defeated two of the Spirit Superior , the Superior Inspector , the Minister Ministry of Magic and Assistant Minister of Youth to escape . 
Although Harry goes anywhere within the castle , the only topic of conversation is Dumbledore's escape , and although some details may be distorted when recounted ( Harry overhears a second - year - old girl swears by the death of another student , Fudge , who is currently in St . Mungo's Hospital with a pumpkin in his head ) , but surprisingly , The rest they get is very accurate . 
Everyone knows , for example , that Harry and Marietta are the only students who witnessed the incident in Dumbledore's office , and because Marietta was in the infirmary , Harry noticed that he was always surrounded and asked to . recounted directly . 
' Dumbledore will come back soon , ' said Ernie Macmillan , who was on his way back from the Herbal Medicine class , after listening intently to Harry's story . 
' They could not have kicked us out when we were in their sophomore year and this time they would not be able to do it . 
Mrs. Beo said to me - ' it was a secret , forcing Harry , Ron and Hermione to come closer to hear ' - Umbridge tried to return to his office last night , after They searched in and out of the castle . 
They could not pass the stone statue . 
The principal's office was sealed to her . " Ernie smirked . ' She was obviously angry . ' 
' Well , I think she really wants to be in that office , ' Hermione said spitefully as they walked down the stone steps of the Hall . ' ordered the other teachers , the lazy , foolish , power - hungry ' 
' Now , do you really want to end that , Granger ? ' 
Draco Malfoy glided from behind the door , followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle . 
Her pale , pale face brightened with a malicious smile . 
' I'm afraid I ' ll have to deduct points for the Hufflepuff and the Hufflepuff , ' he said . 
' Only the teacher has the right to deduct points from the Malfoys , ' Ernie said immediately . 
' Moreover , we are also leaders , remember ? ' Ron growled . 
' I know that the chiefs have no point deduction , Weasel King , ' Malfoy laughed contemptuously . 
Crabbe and Goyle laughed . ' But the test team members are - ' 
' What , ' said Hermione , 
' Examination Team , Granger , ' said Malfoy , pointing to the silver badge on the cloak beneath the Leader's badge . 
' A group of students with the ability to assist the Ministry of Magic , appointed by Professor Umbridge . 
The members of the Examination Team have the right to deduct points , so Ms . Granger , except for your 5 points , has been insulted by our new Headteacher . 
Macmillan , 5 points for arguing me back . 
Five points because I do not like you , Potter . 
Weasley , your clothes are disgusting , so I subtract five points . 
Well , forget it , you're a Mudblood , ten points for that . ' 
Ron pulled out the wand , but Hermione pushed it away , whispering , ' Do not ! ' 
' Wise , Granger , ' Malfoy spat out . ' The new president , the new era will now be fine , Potty Weasel King ' 
Laughing , she left with Crabbe and Goyle . 
' It's spoiled , ' Ernie said , sounding very frightened . ' It can not be allowed to subtract points ridiculously it will completely destroy the parent system . ' 
But Harry , Ron , and Hermione had returned to the big hourglass in the niches along the wall behind them , where they had scored homes . 
The Gryffindor House and the Ravenclaw House are in the same position this morning . 
As soon as they looked at them , the stones were still flying upward , reducing the amount in the bottom of the watch . 
In fact , the only timepiece that does not seem to change is the Slytherin , which is filled with blue stones . 
' You see ? Fredvang's voice . 
He and George had just walked down the stairs and joined Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ernie in front of the hourglass . 
' Malfoy had just subtracted all of us fifty , ' said Harry irritably as they watched several more stones fly up in the Gryffindor sand clock . 
' Oh , Montague was trying to play you guys during the break , ' George said . 
' What do you mean , ' tried ' ? ' Said Ron immediately . 
' It will never be able to say anymore , ' Fred said , ' because you put it in the Transformer Room on the first floor . ' 
Hermione looked dumbfounded . 
' But you're in trouble ! ' 
' It was not until Montague came back , it took several weeks , and I do not know where we got it , ' Fred said coldly . ' Anyway , we decided not to worry about getting into trouble anymore . ' 
' Have you ever been interested in that ? ' Asked Hermione . 
' Of course , ' said George . ' We were never expelled , did we ? ' 
' We always knew how to stop at the limit , ' Fred said . 
' We're always welcome , ' George said . 
' But we always stop before we cause real chaos , ' says Fred . 
' What time is it ? ' Said Ron probe 
' Oh , now - ' George said . 
' - when Dumbledore left - ' Fred said . 
' We thought it was a little messy , ' George said . 
" Is what our new Principal deserves , " Fred said . 
' You are done like that ! Hermione whispered . ' You really are not allowed to do that ! 
She wants an excuse to expel them ! ' 
" Do not you understand , Hermione ? ' Fred said , and smiled at her . ' We are not eager to stay any longer . 
We left immediately if we did not decide to do something for Dumbledore first . 
So , anyway , ' he checked his watch , ' stage one is also preparing to start . 
I will go to the Hall for lunch , if you are the children , so that the teachers do not think they are involved in this . ' 
' What does not matter ? Hermione said anxiously . 
' You ' ll know right away , ' George said . ' Hurry up . ' 
Fred and George turned their heels and disappeared into the crowd coming down the stairs for lunch . 
Feeling a bit confused , Ernie muttered something about the Unfinished Transformation exercise and ran away . 
' I think we should get out of here , you know , ' said Hermione tensely . ' just to take precaution ... 
' Oh , come on , let's go , ' said Ron , and the three of them headed for the Hall's doors , but Harry was barely able to see the sky with white clouds flying . Again , his nose narrowed to the nostrils of the supervisor Filch . 
It stepped back a few steps ; Mr. Filch looks most comfortable to stand on . 
' The Principal wants to meet up , Potter , ' he said slyly . 
' I did not do anything , ' said Harry absurdly , his head thinking of what Fred and George were about to do . 
The jaw of the teacher shakes with laughter . 
' Having a disability is startling , is not it ? he wheezed . ' Follow me . ' 
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione , both of whom looked worried . 
He shrugged and followed Filch back into the Hall , slipping back to the hungry students who were eating . 
Filch looks particularly happy ; he whispered in his mouth as they climbed up the stone stairs . 
When they reached the floor of the first floor , he said , ' Everything around here is changing , is not it , Potter ? ' 
' You see , ' said Harry coldly . 
' Hmmm , I've been telling Dumbledore for years now that he's too light - hearted for the students , ' said Filch , and giggled . ' Damn you guys will never dare to drop the rotten bullets again if you know I'm allowed to punish you with a whip , right ? 
Will not any one think of throwing Fanged Frisbees in the corridors if we can hang you up in your office ? 
But when the Education Act No . 29 was enacted , Potter , I would be allowed to do all of that and she had asked the Minister to order the expulsion of the Peeves goblin , everything here would be very different . with her coming to power . 
Umbridge apparently made a great effort to pull Filch over to her side , Harry thought , and the worst thing was that he would become an important weapon ; He knew the secret passages in the school and the hideouts were lost to two Weasley twins . 
' Come to the place , ' he said , and glanced at Harry as he stroked three times on the door of Umbridge's office and pushed open the door . 
Potter came to see her , ma ' am . ' 
Umbridge's office was so familiar to Harry after so many times that it was subject to a fine , the same as usual , except for a black sheeting in front of her desk , readable on it . The text is in : DIRECTOR . At the same time , he saw with a throbbing sensation , the Lightning Broom , Cleansweep Fred's and George's Cleansweeps were chained and locked into a solid metal hook on the wall behind the table . 
Umbridge was sitting behind the desk , busy shaving something on the pink parchment , but she looked up and smiled as they walked in . 
' Thanks , Mr. Argus , ' she said sweetly . 
' No , ladies and gentlemen , there is nothing , ' said Filch , bowing so low that his rheumatism allowed , then stepped back . 
' Sit down , ' said Umbridge , curtly , pointing to the chair . 
Harry sat down . 
She continues to write more . 
He watched the kitties playing in the paintings on her head and wondered what her threats were . 
' Okay , now , ' she finally said after putting down the pen and watching him prowling with satisfaction , like a frog preparing to bite a fresh fly . ' Do you want to drink something ? ' 
' What ? ' Said Harry , quite sure that he had misunderstood . 
' To drink , Mr. Potter , ' she said , brighter than ever before . 
Tea ? Coffee ? 
Pumpkin juice ? ' 
When she called the drinks , she waved her wand , and a glass appeared on the table . 
' I do not drink , thank you , ' said Harry . 
' I want something to drink with me , ' she said , her voice sweetly dangerous . ' Choose one . ' 
' Yes , sir , ' said Harry , shrugging . 
She got up and made a move to turn the milk back on him . 
After that , she gasped around the table and brought it back to him , mouthing a sweet smile with a silly gesture . 
' Here , ' she said and handed her a glass of tea . ' Drink it cool , okay ? 
Now , Mr. Potter , we think we need to talk a bit , after the tragic event last night . ' 
It does not say anything . 
She sat back and waited . 
A long silence passed , then she smiled , ' I have not had a drink yet ! ' 
Lift the glass to the lips and then suddenly lower it . 
One of the nasty cats in the mansion behind Umbridge had big blue eyes that looked exactly like Madam Eye's crazy eyes and he suddenly thought of what he would say if he heard him drink something from a Unknown enemy invites . 
' What's up ? Umbridge said , she was watching him very closely . ' Do you want to add sugar ? ' 
' No , ' said Harry . 
He lifted the glass to his lips and pretended to take a sip , though still holding his mouth shut . 
Mrs. Umbridge grinned . 
' Good , ' she whispered . ' Very good . 
Now ' she leaned forward . Where is Albus Dumbledore ? ' 
' I do not know , ' said Harry at once . 
" Drink , drink , " she said while still smiling . ' Now , Mr. Potter , let's not play baby games . 
I know you know where to go . 
Mr. Dumbledore and this guy have done this together in the first place . 
Consider your situation , Sir Potter ' 
' I do not know where he is , ' repeated Harry . 
She pretends to drink . 
She followed him attentively . 
' Very good , ' she said , though she seemed unhappy . ' In that case , please tell us about Sirius Black by the way . ' 
Harry's stomach twitched and his shaking tea hand made the glass clench at the plate . 
He lifted the glass to his mouth with his lips tightly shut , causing a bit of hot water to fall on his cloak . 
' I do not know , ' he said a little too quickly . 
' Mr Potter , ' said Mrs Umbridge , ' I have to remind myself that I am the one who almost caught the Black criminals in the Gryffindor House fire last October . 
I know very well that he has met and if I have any proof of that , the game will be fired immediately , I promise . 
I repeat , Sir Sirius Black is where ? ' 
' I do not know , ' said Harry loudly . ' I do not know anything . ' 
They stared at each other for a long moment , causing Harry to begin to feel tears in his eyes . 
Then Umbridge stood up . 
' Very good , Potter , this time I will remember the game , but you have been warned : behind me is the power of the Ministry . 
Any communication channel in and out of the school is controlled . 
Floo's network operator will keep an eye out for all the fire in Hogwarts School - except for our own fire . Our Examination Team will open and read all the messages sent to and from the Castle . 
And Filch will track all the secret passages in and out of the castle . 
If we find even a piece of evidence ' 
BOOM ! 
Floors shake . 
Mrs. Umbridge slipped to the side , grabbed the table from her fall and looked dumbfounded . 
' What was - ? ' 
She was looking at the door . 
Harry took advantage of the opportunity to pour the almost full glass of tea into the nearby dry flowerpot . 
He could hear people running and screaming a few floors below . 
' Go back to lunch , Potter ! Mrs. Umbridge yelled , she held up her wand and rushed out of the office . 
Harry let her run away then rushed to see the cause of those screams . 
It is not difficult to find . 
When down under a floor , the noise became more and more clear . 
Someone ( and Harry immediately knew who that was ) had burned something that looked like a huge fireworks witch . 
The dragons were filled with blue and yellow light rays flying up and down the corridors , streaming out the flames and loud explosions ; the five - foot - diameter pink - ringed fireworks round the air like flying saucers ; rockets with long , silver - colored star - studs rumbling from the walls ; the firecrackers write obscene words in the air ; The bombs exploded like mines everywhere , and instead of burning , blurring or extinguishing , these waterfalls seemed to recharge and continue to perform . 
Filch and Umbridge were standing there , apparently dead standing in horror , halfway up the stairs . 
As Harry watched , one of the big fireworks rings seemed decided that it needed more space to perform ; She wiggles towards Umbridge and Filch with a loud scream threatening " wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll " 
Both men screamed and leaned down , and it hovered through the window behind them and poured out into the ground . 
Meanwhile , a few large purple and purple bats are pouring out of the open door at the end of the corridor to sneak into the second floor . 
' Hurry up , Filch , hurry up ! Umbridge shrieked , ' They ' ll all over the place if we do not get something done - Stupefy ] ' 
A red light flashed from her wand and fired on a missile . 
Instead of dying in the air , it explodes so hard that a hole in a painting depicts a witch who seems to be wading in the grass ; She ran away just in time , a few seconds later she reappeared on the next picture , where a pair of sorcerers playing cards rushed to stand up to her . 
Do not stun them , Flinch ! Umbridge snapped , as he guessed the words he was about to recite 
' You're right , Principal ! ' Flinch wheezed , for a Squib would have no way of stuning them unless they were swallowed . 
He reached the nearest closet , pulled out a broom and began to fight with the airborne artillery , and for a few seconds the broomstick began to burn . 
Harry looked at his eyes , laughing and sneaking down , running to a door he knew was hidden behind a carpet hanging down a corridor and threw through it to see Fred and George's brothers escape . Behind them , listening to Umbridge and Flinch shouting , shivering as they tried to hold back their laughter 
' Impressive , ' Harry whispered , grinning . ' Very impressive you will make Mr. Filibuster unemployed ' 
' Or not , ' George whispered , wiping his tears away from his face . ' Oh , he hoped she would try to take the loss . They would multiply ten if she did . ' 
The fireworks continued to explode and fluttered throughout the school day . 
And even though they caused a lot of damage , especially the firecrackers , the other teachers did not seem to care much about them . 
' Come on , ' said Professor McGonagall mockingly , as one of the dragons dug into her class , growling wildly and spitting out the flames . Game Brown , you can run to the principal's office and report that there is a fireworks here ? 
As a result , Professor Umbridge used his first afternoon as his principal to run errands around the school , responding to requests from other teachers , apparently none of them capable of scanning the artillery . He left the room without her . 
As the bell rings and they return to Gryffindor Tower with their briefcase , Harry sees , with an indescribable gaze , Umbridge , a confused man , soaked in sweat , walked over to Professor Flitwick's class . 
' Thank you very much , Professor ! " said Flitwick , with a rattling voice . ' I could have kicked myself out of this firework , of course , but I was not sure whether I was allowed to do so or not . ' 
Laughing , he closed the classroom in front of her scowl . 
Fred and George were the Gryffindor heroes that night . 
Even Hermione went through the crowds to greet them . 
Those guns were great . She said with admiration . 
Thank you , George said , looking surprised with satisfaction , it was Uncle Weasley Fire . " 
Only thing is , we have cleaned up the stockpile , and again have to start with white . 
Still , it was worth it , Fred said . If you want to be on the waiting list , Hermione , a Galleon Common Box of Fire and twenty for the Highest Fire . 
Hermione returned to the table , where Harry and Ron were staring at their purse as if hoping that the heap of homework would move on and start making it himself . 
Why do not we take a night off ? Hermione said cheerfully , as a Weasley missile with a silver tail flickered through the window . Anyway , Easter will start on Friday , we have plenty of time . 
You feel good ? Asked Ron , looking at her incredulously . 
Now if you want to mention , Hermione says , you know you do not think you have a bit of rebellion . 
Harry still hears the distant roar of the cannons left over when Ron and Ron go to bed one hour , and when she is dressed up , a halo soars through the tower , still visible in FOO . 
He climbed onto the bed , yawned . 
As it took off the glass , the guns occasionally soared through the windows to become dim , looking like bright , beautiful and mysterious clouds in the magical night sky . 
He turned around , wondering what Umbridge was feeling at Dumbledore's first day , and how Fudge was reacting when he learned that the school had spent most of the day in a mess . confusion 
Smiling to himself , Harry closed his eyes 
But the howls and roar of the surviving cannonballs seem to have wandered away , or maybe it's just too far away . 
She falls right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries . 
She rushed to the black door and opened it open 
It's open 
He walked into the round room filled with doors that crossed his hands on a door in these same things , and it opened inward . 
Now it was in a long , rectangular room full of strange metal spikes . 
There were glittering lights on the wall , but it did not stop to look carefully at it to continue 
There is a door at the far end , and the door opens again as it touches 
And now it was in a dim , high and wide room , like a church , filled with rows and rows of towering glass , filled with tiny , dusty orbs now Harry's heart . was beating fast because of the agitation it knew where to go and it ran fast , but its footsteps did not make any noise in this spacious and deserted room 
There is something that it very , very very like 
It wants something or someone else wants 
Its scar aches 
BANG ! 
Harry woke up , confused and angry . 
The dorm room was filled with laughter . 
Cool ! Seamus said , shining on the window . I think one of the fireworks touched a rocket , they were like a pair of friends , come here look here ! 
Harry heard Ron and Dean rush out of bed to get a better look . 
It was still in silence while the scar on her forehead was softening and a despair overwhelmed her . 
He felt a sense of satisfaction was overwhelming it at the moment he was near it . 
The glowing pink and silver piglets are flying around the entrance of the Gryffindor Tower . 
Harry lay down and listened to the Gryffindor's chants in the dorm rooms below them . 
His stomach was torn when he remembered that he had to learn Occlumency the next evening . 
* 
The next day , Harry panicked , not knowing what Snape would say if he found out how far Harry had gone in the Room of Mysterious Dreams . 
With a sense of guilt , he realized that he had not practiced Occlumency since the last lesson : too many things happened after Dumbledore had gone ; It sure would not have been able to empty his mind even if it tried . 
However , it is doubtful that Snape will accept the excuse . 
He tried to practice a bit at the end of that day , but there was no result . 
Hermione repeatedly asked him what was going on when he silently tried to get rid of his thoughts and emotions , and this was not the best time to empty his mind . Ask questions to review the lessons in class . 
At worst , he started going to Snape's office after dinner . 
However , when it was halfway through the Hall , For hastily pursued it . 
' Here , ' said Harry , delighted for the reason for delaying the class with Snape , and beckoning her into the corner of the Hall , where there were huge hourglasses . 
Gryffindor's clock is now almost empty . ' Are you okay ? 
Did Umbridge ask you about DA ? ' 
' No , ' said hastily . ' No , it's just me , I just want to say Harry , I can never imagine Marietta going to reveal ' 
' Oh , come on , ' said Harry gloomily . 
He felt Cho should pick her friends more carefully ; It was a little comforting to hear the latest news , Marietta was in the infirmary and Pomfrey could not improve her boil . 
' She is really cute , ' Cho said . ' She just made a mistake - ' 
Harry looked at her suspiciously . 
' A lovely man made a mistake ? 
It sold all of us , including you ! ' 
' We all got out , right ? ' Give the defense . ' You know , her cheeks worked for the Ministry , it was hard for her - ' 
' Ron's father is also working for the Ministry ! " Harry said irritably . ' And he noticed , he did not have the whistle on his face - ' 
' That's really a grimace of Hermione Granger's , ' said the fierce . ' She should have told us she had cast the checklist - ' 
' I thought it was a clever idea , ' said Harry loosely . 
Crazy and her eyes flashed . 
' Ah yes , I forgot - of course , if that was the idea of ​​ Hermione loved - ' 
' I'm starting to cry , ' said Harry , warning . 
' I will not do that ! she exclaimed . 
' Oh well , ' he said . ' I have enough to worry about . ' 
' Go and take care of your business ! ' Let's get angry , turn around and step on . 
Extremely cranky , Harry descended down the stairs to Snape's cage and though he knew from his experience that Snape could easily cross his mind if he got there in an angry and angry mood But it does nothing but think of some things it should tell Cho about Marietta before it reaches the door of the cellar . 
' I'm late , Potter , ' said Snape coldly as Harry closed his wings behind him . 
Snape was standing with his back on it , as usual taking his thoughts and putting them very carefully in the Dumbledore's Pot . 
He dropped the last silver yarn into the stone pot and turned his face to Harry . 
' What , ' he said . ' Did you practice ? ' 
' Okay , ' said Harry , and looked at one of Snape's legs . 
' Well , we ' ll know this right ? ' Snape said softly . ' Take out the chopsticks , Potter . ' 
Harry stood in his usual place , facing Snape through the table . 
Her heart beats fast because of Cho's anger and worries about how much of Snape's mind will draw from his head . 
' Count to three , ' snape said lazy . ' One two - ' 
Snape's office door suddenly opened and Draco Malfoy came in . 
' Professor Snape , teacher - oh - sorry - ' 
Malfoy looked at Snape and Harry with astonishment . 
' Nothing , Draco , ' said Snape , lowering his wand . ' Potter is here to foster more of the drug . ' 
Harry did not see Malfoy's delight like that since Umbridge had ridden everything up to check on Hagrid . 
' I do not know , ' he said , glancing at Harry for a stretch , and Harry knew his face was hot . 
It can pay any price to scream the truth to Malfoy - or , better yet , attack it with a curse . 
' Okay , Draco , what's wrong ? ' asked Snape . 
' That's Professor Umbridge , sir - she's taking care of me , ' said Malfoy . 
Montague was found , Teacher , it jumped into a toilet in the fourth floor . ' 
' How did it get in there ? ' asked Snape . 
' I do not know , Master , it's very confusing . ' 
' Very good , very good . 
Game Potter , ' said Snape , ' we will continue this lesson tomorrow . ' 
He turned away and ran out of Snape's office . 
Malfoy barked at it , ' Nutrition poisoning ? " from behind Snape before running after him . 
Stumbled on by anger , Harry put his wand in his cloak and was about to leave the room . 
At least it added another twenty - four hours to practice ; He knew it was fun to escape , though it was hard to digest that Malfoy would tell the whole school that he needed to foster more drug addiction . 
He came to the office door when he saw it : a silver light was dancing on the doorway . 
It stopped and looked at it , it reminded of something and then it remembered : it was like the light it saw in the dream last night , the light in the second room that it passed on the way to Room of the Mysteries . 
It's back . 
That light was coming from the Snake Pots on the table . The silver and white crowd was stirring . 
Snape's thoughts on things he did not want Harry to see if he suddenly broke his defense 
Harry stared at the Pots , his curiosity burning , what was it that Snape wanted to hide from Harry ? 
Silver light jumped on Harry's wall , two steps toward the table , he thought very wiggle . 
Could it be the information about the Mystery Room that Snape insisted on not letting him know ? 
Harry looked behind his shoulder , now his heart pounding harder and faster than ever . 
How long would Snape take to free Montague from the toilet ? 
Will you come back straight or will you take Montague to the clinic ? 
The following assumption is more certain than that of Montague being the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team , Snape would want to make sure he was okay . 
Harry took a few more steps toward the Pot and looked deep into it . 
He hesitated , finally heard the wand draw . 
The office and lobby are completely quiet . 
He used a wand to poke lightly at the group in the Signpost . 
The silver cloud in it started to stir up very quickly . 
Harry leaned forward and saw that it was transparent . 
Again , it looked into a room as if looking from a round window and , unless it was mistaken , it was looking at the Hall . 
His breath is blurring the thoughts of his master Snapes . The bee is so crazy if he does this despicable thing he's shaking . Snape can come back anytime but Harry thinks about Cho's anger , Malfoy's ridiculous face , and the courage to risk grabbing it . 
He took a deep breath and dabbed his face in Snape's mind . 
Immediately the floor of the office became uneasy , causing Harry to head tilted to the Pot 
He fell through a deep blackness , it reeling as he passed , and then - 
He was standing in the hall , but there were no four tables of four . 
Instead , there are more than a hundred smaller tables , one turned in the same direction , each with a sitting student , with a low head , with a bow on the parchment . 
The only sound was the scraping of the pens and occasionally the rustling of some pupils when the rolls were repainted . 
Obviously that is a test . 
The face lit up through the tall windows of the lowered heads , illuminating the hazelnut , copper and golden hair in brilliant light . 
Harry looked around carefully . 
Snape's teacher must be somewhere around here as his memory 
And the teacher , after a high table behind Harry . 
Harry stared . 
Snape , in his teens , looks slender , yellowing , looking like a tree in the shade . 
His hair straightened and fell , shiny and sloping down his desk , the curly - haired nose of which was about half an inch in length when he wrote . 
Harry walks around the teacher and reads the title of the test : PREVENTING THE COLLEGE OF ART - THE NORMAL STORAGE CERTIFICATE . 
Snape was probably around 15 or 16 , at the age of Harry . 
His teacher stretches out on a roll of paper ; He is longer than the foot , the little teacher , and is difficult to read . 
' Five more minutes ! ' 
Harry's voice snapped . 
Turning back , he saw Professor Flitwick's head moving between the tables , not far away . 
Professor Flitwick is passing through a boy with black hair messing with a messy black hair 
Harry moved so fast that if it really existed there it would have flipped over the tables . 
Instead , it seemed as if it was sliding away dreamily between the two tables and entering the third row . 
The back of the black - haired boy was closer than he was sitting upright , lowering his wrist , pulling his parchment back to read what he had just written . 
Harry was standing at the table and looking at his fifteen - year - old father . 
A sense of excitement exploded in his head : it looked like he was looking at himself with a few exceptions . 
The eyes of three brown James , Harry's high nose and no scar on his forehead , but they have the same skinny face , the same mouth , and eyebrows ; James's hair was flushed just like Harry's hair right now , his triceps like Harry's and Harry's might say that if James got up , they were less than an inch apart . 
Three James yawned and scratched his head again ; Make your hair tangle more tangled . 
Then , glancing quickly at Professor Flitwick , he turned and smiled at a boy sitting behind him four rows of chairs . 
Snatching his head , Harry saw Sirius raising his thumb with James . 
He was about to shake his chair with a casual look , allowing it to rest on his hind legs . 
He looked very handsome ; The black hair was covering his eyes with the natural elegance that neither James nor Harry could get , and a girl sitting behind him was staring at him , even though he did not seem to notice it . 
And sitting two hours away from this little girl - Harry's stomach aches with joy - is Remus Lupine . 
He looks blue and is leaning forward with his test : while he read his answers again , he scratched his chin with his pen , he frowned slightly . 
This meant that the worm's tail was everywhere around here , and after a few seconds Harry saw him : a little boy , gray hair with a pointed spear . Worm's tail seems anxious ; he sticks his fingernails , staring at the papers , moving his toes on the ground . 
Sometimes he looked at the next article . 
Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment , then turned to James , who was scribbling something on a piece of paper . 
He is drawing a Snitch and is now recording the letters L . E . 
Please write down ! Professor Flitwick said . 
Again , Stebbins ! 
Please sit still when I collect ! 
Accio ! 
More than a hundred rolls of paper glided into the air and flown toward Professor Flitwick's ready hands , causing him to take a few steps back . 
Many students laughed . 
Some of the students at the front desk stood up , running up to grab Flitwick's elbow and help him get up . 
Thank you , Professor Flitwick panting . Good , you guys can go ! 
Harry looked over at his father , who was hurriedly crossed by L . E . , who had just brushed him back and forth , tucked his wrist and paper into his pocket , wrapped his bag on his back , and waited for Sirius to join them . 
Harry looked around and caught sight of Snape , who was walking in the middle of the tables toward the Hall , still bent over the exam . 
His shoulders were still soaring , he walked with a look of reminiscent of a spider , his shiny hair hanging down his face . 
A bunch of girls are huddled between Snape and James , Sirius and Lupine . 
Harry ran between them to try to keep Snape in sight while still listening to James and his friends . 
Do you like number ten , Silver Moon ? Sirius asked as they entered the Hall . 
Like , Lupine said cheerfully . 
gives five signs to identify a werewolf . 
An excellent sentence . 
So you've presented enough signs ? James asked mockingly . 
I think so , Lupine replied in a serious tone , as they walked into the crowded crowd around the front door , eagerly coming out of the sunlit courtyard . A : It is sitting on my chair . 
Hai : it's my dress . 
Ba : Its name is Remus Lupine . 
The worm is the only one who does not smile . 
I have a muzzle , a pupil in my eye and a tail , he says nervously , but I can not think more - 
Oh , the worm's tail ? James said hotly , Every month he went out with a werewolf - 
Talk a little , Lupine reminded . 
Harry looked back at him anxiously . 
Snape was still close to him , still drowning in the questions in the test - but this was Snape's memory , and Harry was convinced that if Snape had chosen a different direction to go out of the way , it was not . How to follow James three further . 
However , it was relieved to see James and his three friends strode past the grass to the lake , Snape's follower , who was still re - reading the test and seemed unaware of where he was going . 
By getting up from the teacher a bit , Harry managed to stay close to James and his three friends . 
Oh , I think this exam is easy , he heard Sirius say . I would be surprised if I did not get the Outstanding score . 
Me too , says James . 
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a golden snitch . 
Where are you taking it ? 
Going on , James said quietly . 
He was playing with the Snitch , letting it fly at least a foot before wrapping it up , his reflexes were amazing . 
The tail of the wormhole looked at him with wonder 
They stopped in the shade of an oak tree right in front of the lake , where Harry , Ron and Hermione had been sitting all day on a Sunday to finish their homework , and then fallen to the ground . . 
Harry looked back again , and he was glad to realize that Snape was sitting still in the grass in the shade of a bush . 
He was still fascinated with the OWL exam as usual , and so Harry sat comfortably in the grass between the oaks and bushes and observed the group of four under the tree . 
The sun was spreading on the banks of the river , where the group of girls had just left the Great Hall while they were giggling , taking off their shoes and socks , taking a dip in the water . 
Lupine drew a book and read . 
Sirius looked at the students laughing on the grass , with a haughty expression , but very charismatic . 
James was still playing with the Snitch , letting it fly away , as if it could escape , but he always caught it in the last second . The tail of the mouth gasped . 
Each time James made a particularly hard catch , Worm's tail gasped and clapped . 
After five minutes of observation , Harry wondered why the three of them did not say that the tail of Conan restrained , but it seemed that afternoon , James was very excited . 
Harry noticed that his dad had a habit of tugging his head as if to keep his hair tangled , and he kept glancing at the girls sitting by the river . 
' Can you stop it , ' Sirius said finally , when James was performing a beautiful catch and Worm's tail jumped up and down , before Worm's tail made him wet for the nuggets . his dance . 
The wolf's tail blushed , and James's three mouths were laughing to his ear 
" If it bothered you , " he said and snitched his snitch back into his pocket . 
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only person that James had stopped showing himself . 
' I'm so bored , ' said Sirius . ' I wish the moon was now round again . ' 
' You can do that , ' said Lupine gloomy from the back of the book . ' We have the Turning Charm , if you're bored , you can try it on yourself . here " and the teacher raised the book . 
But Sirius just snorted . ' I do not need to see that crap , I know it already . ' 
' This will make you excited , Angel Stuff , ' James said quietly . 
' Look who here ' 
Sirius turned his head . 
He becomes as quiet as a dog watching a rabbit . 
' Awesome , ' he said softly . ' Snivellus . ' 
Harry turned around to see what Sirius was looking at . 
Mr. Snape stood up , dropped the Common Witch Certificate test in his briefcase . 
When he left the shade of trees and crossed the carpet , both Sirius and James stood up . 
Lupine and Wormtail are still sitting : Lupine is still staring at the book with great concentration , though his eyes do not move and a faint wrinkle appears between the two eyebrows ; Wormtail looked at Sirius and James , then turned to Snape with a foresighted look on his face . 
' Fine , Snivellus ? ' James said loudly . 
Snape's teacher responded as quickly as he could with one attack : dropping the bookcase , reaching into his cloak and pulling out his wand halfway through when James screamed , ' Expelliarmus ! ' 
Snape's wand streaks away as far as 12 feet in the air and falls to the grass behind . 
Sirius laughed . 
' Impedimenta ! he said , pointing at Snape , who was halfway to his dropped wand . 
The students turned around to look . 
Some come closer . 
Some look frightened , others cheer . 
Snape was breathing heavily on the ground . 
Three James and Sirius approached the teacher , his wand raised , and James glanced at the girls at the edge of the lake over his shoulder as he moved . 
The wormhooter stood up , looked at everything with a look of lust , then rounded Lupine to see better . 
' How is the test , Snivelly ? " said James . 
' I watched it , its nose stuck to the parchment , ' said Sirius viciously . 
Roll with greasy stains , will not be able to read a word at all . ' 
Some followers laugh ; It's clear that Snape is not popular . 
The wolf tail wiggled . 
Snape tried to stand up but magic still worked ; He was tied up by invisible wires . 
' You - wait , ' he gasped , staring at James with hatred , ' you - wait ! ' 
what are you waiting for ? Sirius said calmly . ' What are you going to do , Snivelly , nose spray on us ? ' 
Snape's teacher came out with a curse and a spell , but with the wand a dozen feet away , nothing happened . 
' Wash your mouth , ' James said coldly . 
' Scourgify ! ' 
Immediately , the pink soap bubbles came out of Snape's mouth ; foam on the teacher's lips , locking his mouth and making him clogged - 
' let him YEN ! ' 
Three James and Sirius looked around . 
James's free hand immediately raised his hair . 
It was one of the girls standing at the edge of the lake . 
She had thick , dark red hair on her shoulders and bright blue eyes - Harry's eyes . 
that's Harry's cheeks . 
' Good , Evans ? ' said James , and his voice suddenly became more cute , deeper and older . 
' Leave him alone , ' repeated Lily . 
She was staring at him with hatred . ' What did he do ? ' 
' Well then , ' said James , looking deliberate , ' doing nothing , it's going to lurk in front of me , if you know what you mean ' 
Some students around here laughed , Sirius and the wormhole were laughing , but Lupine was obviously interested in the book and neither was Lily . 
" You think you're funny , " cheeks said coldly . " But he's just a pretentious , bully , Potter . leave him alone ' 
' I ' ll leave it alone if you go out with me , Evans , ' James said quickly . ' Let's go play with him and I ' ll never raise my chopsticks with Snivelly again . ' 
Behind the three , Chakra Trapping is out . 
Snape began to move to where the wand fell , spitting soap bubbles as the gurney went . 
' I would not go out with you if I had to choose between you and the giant squid , ' said Lily . 
' Bad luck , Horns , ' Sirius said , and turned to Snape . ' OH MY GOD ! ' 
But it was too late ; Snape pointed his wand straight to James ; there was a flash of light and a deep cut appeared on one side of James's face , causing blood to splash across his clothes . 
Three James reacted quickly : a second light flashed , Snape hung up in the air , the cloak over his head revealing pale legs and gray clothes . 
Many people in the crowd cheered ; Sirius , James and the wormhook laughed . 
Lily said with an angry expression that was dilating as if to smile , ' Get him off ! ' 
' Okay , ' said James , and suddenly raised his chopsticks ; Snape fell into a pile of dirt on the ground . 
Dressed up , he quickly stood up , raised his chopsticks , but Sirius said , ' Petrificus Totalus ! ' and Snape collapsed , stiffened like a board . 
' HE IS YEN ! ' Lily shouted . 
She pulled out the wand . 
Three James and Sirius looked at him . 
' Ah , Evans , do not force me to kiss you , ' James said sternly . 
' Take the curse for him ! ' 
James sighed , then turned back to Snape and mumbled a curse spell . 
' You go , ' he said , as Snape tried to stand up . ' You're lucky because Evans is here , Snivellus - ' 
' I do not need help from a dirty Mudblood like her ! ' 
Lily blinked . 
" Good , " the cheeks said coldly . ' I will not have to worry about you anymore . 
And if I were you , I would go for the pants , Snivellus . ' 
' Please excuse Evans ! " James screamed at Snape , his wand pointing at the threatening master . 
' I do not need you to make him apologize to me , ' Lily's cheeks exclaimed openly with James . ' You're as bad as him . ' 
' What ? exclaimed James . 
You NEVER call me ... you know what ! ' 
' Make your hair tangle up because you think it looks as good as the new mortar down the broom , show off your stupid Snitch , walk in the corridors and take the spell out to anyone . annoyed him just because he could - I was surprised that his broom did not fall over with such a stupid head . 
You make me sick . ' 
Heels and haste away . 
' Evans ! ' James screamed behind his cheeks . ' Hey , EVANS ! ' 
But she did not come back . 
' What happened to her ? " said James , and completely failed to show that the question was a drop and it did not matter to him . 
' Try to read the meaning of her words , I said she thought you were a pretender , ' said Sirius . 
' Okay , ' said three James , looking very angry , ' okay - ' 
A light flashes and Snape is once again suspended in the air . 
' Does anyone want to see me drop Snivelly's pants ? ' 
But did James actually snap Snapes pants , Harry never discovered . 
A hand appeared to grasp its upper arm like a clamp . 
With a pained grimace , Harry looked around to see who was holding his hand , and saw , with a terrible fear , the size of an adult , full grown adult Snape standing beside him , white be angry 
" Are you happy ? ' 
Harry felt he was lifted up in the air ; Summer air evaporates around it ; It was floating in the dark black , Snape's hand still clutching his upper arm . 
With that , with a feeling of going up as if it was upside down in the air , its legs touched and the rock in Snape's basement and it stood next to the Pot of Signs on Snape's desk on the table . The evening of study was taught by a pharmacist . 
' What , ' said Snape , still clasping Harry's hand so tightly that his hand began to numb . ' How happy was you , Potter ? ' 
' Kh - no , ' said Harry , trying to escape his grip . 
The scene was horrified : Snape's lips quivered , his face white , his teeth bared . 
' A humorous man , your father , is not it ? ' Snape's master and Harry shook so hard that his glasses fell to his nose . 
' I do not - ' 
Snape pushed Harry away from him with all his might . 
Harry fell mango waves on the basement . 
' You will not be reminded of what you've seen with anyone ! Snape snarled . 
' No , ' said Harry , and tried to stay away from Snape . ' No , of course you - ' 
" Get outta here , I never want to see you in this office again ! ' 
And as Harry bumped into the door , a jar of dead cockroaches broke over his head . 
He opened the door and ran across the corridor , stopping only when Snape went to three floors . There , he leaned against the wall , his heart pounding and rubbing his bruised arm . 
He did not want to return to Gryffindor Tower too soon , and did not want to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen . 
What makes Harry feel scared and unhappy is not being scolded or thrown by the jars ; but that it knew the feeling of being humiliated in the midst of a bunch of indifferent people , and that it knew exactly how Snape felt about being tortured by his father , and if he judged by the What he just saw , his father always arrogant arrogant , is the character that Snape always attributed to it . 
Chapter 29 : PROFESSIONAL ADVICE 
' But why did not you continue the lessons of the Patronage ? " Hermione said in disagreement . 
' I told you already , ' Harry grumbled . ' Master Snape thinks I can practice myself because I've mastered it . ' 
' So you do not dream anymore ? " Hermione said doubtfully . 
' No , ' said Harry , not looking at her . 
" I think Snape should not stop the re - classes until you're sure you can master the use of that spell ! ' Hermione said with irritation . ' Harry , I think you should go back to Snape and ask him ... ' 
' No , ' said Harry earnestly . ' Skip , Hermione , okay ? ' 
Today is the first day of Easter and Hermione , according to his tradition , uses most of the day to draw up a modified schedule of all three . 
Harry and Ron let her do it ; It's easier than arguing with her , and anyway they can be useful . 
Ron was frightened to find out that they only had six weeks to go to the exam . 
' How could you be so surprised ? Hermione questioned as she waved the small wand on each of the boxes on Ron's timetable , making it flicker in different colors depending on the subject . 
' I do not know , ' said Ron , ' so many things happen . ' 
' Done , here you are , ' said the little girl and gave Ron a timid , ' If you catch up with this , you ' ll be fine . ' 
Ron looked at the table , but then he looked up . 
" You give me a break one week a week ! ' 
' It's Quidditch practice , ' said Hermione . 
The smile faded on Ron's face . 
' I do not understand ? ' it lamented . ' Our chance to win this year's Quidditch Cup is the same as our triple chance of becoming the Minister of Magic . ' 
Hermione was silent ; She looked at Harry , who was staring at a spot on the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks croaked in his hand to look at the ear . 
' What is it , Harry ? ' 
' What ? ' he said quickly . ' Nothing . ' 
It took the Magus Defense Theory and pretended to look for something on the catalog page . 
Crookshanks stops trying to get Harry's attention and goes to Hermione's chair . 
' I saw him for a while , ' said Hermione . ' She looked so miserable that the two of them quarreled ? ' 
' Ah , well , we've been arguing , ' said Harry , grabbed the excuse gratefully . 
' What is it about ? ' 
' About her sweet girlfriend , Marietta , ' said Harry . 
' Yeah , that's right , I can not say you're wrong ! " Ron said angrily and put down the revised schedule . ' If it was not for her ' 
Ron began to criticize Marietta Edgecombe , so that Harry felt help ; All he had to do was get angry , nodded approvingly , and said , ' Yeah , ' and ' yes ' every time Ron paused for breath , with the rest of his mind wandering , with a mood more miserable than ever , at what it saw in the Sign . 
He felt the memory of those things that stinged from within . 
He was always sure his parents were wonderful people , and Snape's slander of his character could not erase that belief . 
How can the words of people like Hagrid and Sirius tell about the great three are not right ? ( Really , look at Sirius , a voice in his head is bad in his head ? ) Yes , once he overhear Prof . McGonagall said that Sir and Sirius are intermittent But she describes them as prototypes of the Weasley twins , which Harry could not even imagine . Fred and George hung upside down to joke for never before . They really hate it like Malfoy , or someone really deserves it 
Harry tried to convince himself of the details in the story that Snape was suffering from what James had done to him : but was Lily's mother asking , ' What did he do to you ? ' And it was not James who answered , ' There is nothing but one that lingers in front of me , if you understand me . " Did not James just start the game simply because Sirius said he was bored ? 
Harry remembered 
Lupine said in the house at Grimmauld Square that Dumbledore had given Snape the title of Chief , in the hope that he would be in control of James and Sirius . But in that Statue , he sat there and watched . happened 
Harry reminds himself that Lily's cheek intervened in time ; Its cheeks are very kind . 
The memory of her face was when she was three , making her three more awkward than ever ; Apparently , she hated James , and Harry could not understand how they could go to marriage . 
More than once or twice , it even wondered if James had forced her to do it 
For nearly five years , the thought of the trio has been a source of inspiration , a spiritual prop of it . 
Whenever someone says it's like James , it feels inflated with pride . 
Now he felt cold and miserable with the thought of him . 
The weather became brighter , brighter and warmer as the Easter holiday passed , but Harry , along with the fifth and seventh - year students , died in the house , wandering back and forth . in the library . 
It pretends to be a bad mood because there is no reason other than the upcoming exam , and because the Gryffindors are getting sick because of it , the reason for it is not questioned . 
' Harry , you're telling me , can you hear me ? ' 
' Huh ? ' 
He looked around . 
Ginny Weasley , looking like she was floating in the wind , was sitting down with her desk in the library . 
It was late Sunday evening : Hermione had returned to the Gryffindor Tower to fix the ancient Runescape exercise , and Ron was practicing Quidditch . 
' Hello , ' said Harry , pulling the books toward him . ' Why do not you practice ? ' 
' It's over , ' Ginny said . " Mr. Ron had to take Jack Sloper to the infirmary . ' 
' What's wrong ? ' 
" Well , we're not sure , but it looks like he was felled by his own blow . " She sighed heavily . ' Anyway , there's a new packet coming in , it's been through Umbridge's new inspection . ' 
She raised a package wrapped in brown paper on the table ; It was clear that it was opened and then packaged very sloppy . 
There is a scrawl on it written in red ink : checked by the Hogwarts School Superior Inspector . 
' I sent Easter eggs , ' Ginny said . 
There's one for my brother . ' 
She gave him a pretty chocolate egg decorated with small stone Snitches , and the word on the package contained a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees . 
Harry looked at it for a moment and with a panicky , it began to feel like his throat tightened . 
' Are you alright , Harry ? " Ginny asked quietly . 
' Oh , you're fine , ' said Harry curtly . 
Choking in the throat makes it painful . 
It does not understand why an Easter egg gives it that feeling . 
' You do not look so good , ' Ginny insisted . ' I'm sure if you talk to Cho ' 
' I do not want to talk to Cho , ' Harry said flatly . 
' Who do you want to talk to ? ' Ginny asked and looked at him more closely . 
' Brother ' 
He glanced around to make sure no one was listening . 
Mrs. Pince was a few yards away , marking a pile of books for Hannah Abbott . 
' I wish I could talk to Sirius , ' he whispered . ' But you know it's impossible . ' 
Ginny kept staring at her knowingly . 
Not knowing what to do , Harry peeled paper wrapped Easter eggs , breaking a piece into his mouth . 
' This , ' Ginny said slowly , and also put another , ' If you really want to talk to Sirius , I think we can find a way . ' 
' Come on , ' said Harry disappointedly . ' Umbridge still checks the fireplaces and reads all our letters ? ' 
" The thing that always follows Fred and George , " Ginny said fluently , " is that you can do everything if you have enough intelligence . ' 
Harry looked at her . 
Maybe that's because of the effect of chocolate - Lupine often recommends eating a little chocolate after a clash with the Dementors - or simply saying it's a burning desire in it last week , but It still feels a little hopeful . 
' What game do you think ? ' 
' Damn it , ' Ginny whispered and jumped . ' I forgot - ' Pince was staring at them , her wrinkled eyes twisting in anger . 
' Chocolate in the library ! she shouted . ' come out - come out - go out ! ' and she waved her wand in control of Harry's books , bags , and ink jarred him and Ginny out of the library , and continued to follow them over their heads as they ran in a hurry .

Although the upcoming exam is of great importance , a handful of pamphlets , pamphlets and announcements related to countless witchcraft occupations still appear on the eight bulletin boards of the Gryffindor Tower at one time . Shortly before the end of the holiday , along with other announcements , one can read : 
All fifth - graders will need to attend the meeting with their Home Manager during the first week of the summer semester . 
Private meeting times are listed below . 
Harry looked at the list and noticed that it was scheduled to arrive at McGonagall's office at 2 . 30 pm on Monday , meaning it would lose most of the Prophet's study . 
It and other fifth - year students will lose significant portion of the last Easter weekend weekend to read all the career information left for them to study . 
' Hmmm , I do not like the clinics , ' said Ron on the last night of his vacation . 
She is immersed in the leaflets bearing the cross bones and wands of St . Mungo's Hospital in front . ' Here you say you need at least an " E " score on the NEWT certificate for Medicinal Herbs , Herbs , Transforms , Spells , and Dark Arts Prevention . I mean they are not attractive ? ' 
' Oh , that's a responsible job , is not it ? Hermione said absently . 
She was mulling over the orange and orange flyers , ' Do you think you like working on MUGGLE people ? ' 
' People will not need more certificates to contact the Muggles ; All they ask for is a Muggle - Based OWL : The most important thing is that you have to be passionate , patient and have good humor . 
' People will need not just a joke to talk to their stepfather , ' said Harry darkly . ' Good evasion is more reasonable . " It reads half the brochures about the witch bank . ' Listen this : ' Are you looking for a challenging career , having the opportunity to travel , adventure and great bonuses associated with danger ? 
If so , consider a position in Gringotts Wizarding Bank , we are recruiting a Broker , you will have the opportunity to go abroad . They want Arithmetic ; Can you do that , Hermione ? ' 
' I do not like the bank , ' said Hermione absently , now she has read the paper , ' Do you have the power to train the giants ? ' 
' Hey , ' Harry said in his ear . 
He looked around ; Fred and George came to them . ' Ginny just told you about your story , ' Fred said , putting his feet on the desk in front of him and making some flyers in the Ministry of Magic slide down the floor . 
Did you say I need to talk to Sirius ? ' 
' What ? " Hermione said briskly , her hand pausing halfway as she reached for the flyer , " Let's blow up the Accident and the Magical Disaster . " 
' Yes , ' said Harry , trying to make him seemingly inadvertent , ' yes , I think I am - ' 
' Do not be so ridiculous , ' said Hermione , as she sat up straight and looked at her as if she did not believe in her own eyes . ' Are you going to do that while Umbridge wanders around the fireplaces and checks on all the owls ? ' 
' Well , we think we figured out how to solve the problem , ' said George , who stretched out and smiled . ' simply causes a distraction . 
Did you notice that we did not mess up during Easter ? ' 
' We wondered why we had to bother people during our break ? ' Fred continued . ' There is no reason , we have answered ourselves . 
Of course , we were messing up while people were reviewing , and believe us , that's the last thing we wanted to do . ' 
He threw Hermione a nod of arrogance . 
She seemed to be in front of that gesture . 
' But business will return to normal tomorrow , ' Fred continued strong . ' And if we're still supposed to be upset , why do not we continue to let Harry talk to Sirius ? ' 
' Okay , but there's a problem , ' said Hermione , and added a simple explanation to those who did not understand yet , ' but if you misunderstand , how can Harry talk ? he ? ' 
' Umbridge's office , ' said Harry quietly . 
He thought about that place the night before and came to the conclusion that there was no other choice . 
It was Umbridge who told her the only fireplace that was not being watched was the fireplace in her room . 
' You - have - lost - mind - no ? " Said Hermione with a suppressed voice . 
Ron lowered the flyers to work in the Department of Mushroom Sales and watched the conversation with caution . 
' I do not think so , ' said Harry , shrugging . 
' How can you get in there ? ' 
Harry had the answer available . 
' Sirius's knife , ' he said . 
' What ? ' 
' Sirius had given himself a knife that could open every door , ' said Harry . ' So even if she casts Alohomora on the door , I can still open it , and I bet she ' ll do it - ' 
' What do you think ? " Hermione asked Ron , and Harry could not help recalling Mrs. Weasley's request to her husband at her first dinner in Grimmauld Square . 
' I do not know , ' said Ron , looking cautious when asked . ' If Harry wants to do that , it's up to him , right ? ' 
' Speak like a real friend and look like a Weasleys man , ' Fred said and pounded Ron on the back . ' Okay . 
We will think of ways to do it tomorrow , right after the lesson , because it can make the most impact if everyone is in the hallway - Harry , we ' ll arrange it on the side of the house . - She was sure we could secure her for about 20 minutes . ' he said and looked at George . 
' Easy , ' George said . 
' What kind of distraction will you have ? ' Asked Ron . 
' He ' ll know , ' Fred said as he and George stood up . ' I ' ll know if you walk through the gates of Gregory the Smarmy around 5 am tomorrow . ' 
* 
Harry woke up very early the next morning , feeling anxious almost the morning before it had to go before the Ministry of Magic's trial . 
Not only was the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fireplace to talk to Sirius made him feel nervous , though that was bad enough ; Today was the first time Harry would have been close to Snape since he threw it to his office . 
After lying on the bed for a moment and thinking about the day before , Harry quietly sat up , went to the window beside Neville's bed , and looked out in the air when the morning was brilliant . 
The sky is clear , muddy blue . 
In front of him , Harry could see the towering oak under which his father harassed Snape . 
He was not sure what Sirius could say to explain what he saw in Judgment , but he wanted to hear Sirius himself say what happened , hoping to know any possible mitigating factors . yes , any reason can justify its actions 
Something that appeals to Harry's attention : there is a movement at the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry squinted under the sun and saw Hagrid appear among the trees . 
Looks like a limp . 
Harry saw the staggering go towards the tent door and into the interior . 
Harry looked a few more minutes . 
But Hagrid does not appear again , but there is smoke rising from the chimney , so Hagrid can not hurt so seriously that he can not fire . 
Harry left the window , went to his chest and began to wear clothes . 
With the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office , Harry never expected it to be a leisure day , but he did not expect Hermione to try to persuade him to give up what he was about to do at five . 
For the first time in her life , she distracts from Professor Binns ' lecture on the History of Magics like Harry and Ron , while pouring out the whispered whisper that Harry is so stubbornly ignoring . 
' And if she caught him there , not only did he get fired , she could even guess that he was talking to Snuffles and this time I was sure she would force him to take Veritaserum and answer the questions . her question ' 
' Hermione , ' Ron said in a low voice , ' will you stop and listen to Mr. Binns , or will I have to write this myself ? ' 
" You change your post one day , it will not kill you right away ! ' 
When they went to the dungeons , both Harry and Ron had not spoken to Hermione . 
Unconcerned , the girl took advantage of their silence to continue to flush uncontrollably with horrible beeps , her words breaking out of her throat sounded like hissing for Seamus . It takes about 5 minutes to check if the cauldron is stuck . 
In the meantime , Snape seemed determined to behave as if Harry was not there . 
Of course it is very familiar with this trick , because it is one of Uncle Vernon's favorite games , and after all it was not the worst thing that he had to endure . 
In fact , compared to the stingy or grainy scoring that he usually receives from Snape , he finds something new and improved , and he is pleased to see that if he is in Alone , it can be made with Energy Drink very easily . 
At the end of the class , he scooped up some of the medicine in a jar , put it back on the table and put it on Snape's desk to mark it , feeling that it could finally reach the ' E ' point . 
He just turned around and heard the sound of falling . 
Malfoy was laughing . 
Harry looked back . 
The dose of her phlegm fell to pieces on the floor and Snape looked gloomy . 
' Well , ' he said softly . ' one more point for Potter . ' 
Harry could not speak because he was angry . 
She turned to her cauldron with the intention of taking another pot of medicine to force Snape to give it to him , but he was appalled that the rest of the drug had disappeared . 
' I'm sorry ! " Said Hermione with a raised hand . ' I'm sorry , Harry . 
I thought you were done so I cleared it up ! ' 
Harry did not bother to reply anymore . 
When the bell rang , it rushed out of the cellar without glancing back , and made sure it could afford a lunch break between Neville and Seamus so that Hermione could not begin to nag him again . again about the use of Umbridge's office . 
In such a bad mood , it went straight to the Culinary class and forgot to make the appointment to discuss the profession with Professor McGonagall , it only remembered when Ron asked why it did not come to the master's office . Responsibility . 
It's upstairs upstairs and rushes there , just a few minutes late . 
' I'm sorry , Professor , ' he gasped as he closed the door . ' I forgot . ' 
' It's okay , Potter , ' she said firmly , but when she spoke , there was someone in the corner sniffing . 
Harry looked around . 
Professor Umbridge was sitting there , a knee - high profile , a frigid fringe around her neck , with a smug look on her face . 
' Sit down , Potter , ' said Professor McGonagall briefly . 
Her hands trembled as she rearranged countless pamphlets indiscriminately on the table . 
Harry sat down with his back on Umbridge and tried pretending he could not hear the shaved hair on her briefcase . 
' Let's get started , Potter , this meeting is to discuss career ideas that may be available and to help decide what subjects to study in the sixth and seventh school years , " Professor McGonagall said . ' You thought about what you wanted to do after graduating from Hogwarts ? ' 
' Er , ' said Harry . 
He realized that the rustle behind it made it less likely to be distracted . 
' Yes ? Professor McGonagall urged Harry . 
' Well , I think yes , maybe God , ' murmured Harry . 
' You need to reach the highest level for that job , ' said Professor McGonagall , and pulled out a small , dark paper from under the papers on the bank and opened it . Here at least 5 NEWTs are required , and all must be rated " Exceeds Expectations " . 
In addition , the game needs to pass a series of very rigorous tests of personality and aptitude at the Shen Yun Office . That's a tough road , Potter , they just took the best people . 
In fact , I think in the last three years , no one has been chosen . ' 
At that moment , Professor Umbridge coughed a little , as if she was trying to keep quiet as much as possible . 
Professor McGonagall's words go away . 
' Do you want to know what kind of lessons you need to study ? she continued to speak louder than before . 
' Yes , ' said Harry . " Do you think there is a Dark Arts Defense ? ' 
' Of course , ' said Professor McGonagall . ' I will also advise you - ' 
Professor Umbridge coughed another word , this time hearing a little better . 
Professor McGonagall closed his eyes for a moment , then opened it , and continued as if nothing had happened . 
' I also advise you to study the Transfiguration classes , because the gods will always need the Transformer and the Enchantment in their work . 
And to tell you right now , Potter , we will not accept a student in our NEWT class unless the student has achieved " Exceeds Expectations " or higher than the OWL Certificate of Compassion . 
Currently , the game only reaches the " Acceptable " level , so you will have to try harder than before the exam to have the opportunity to pursue the chosen profession . 
Next , you have to learn the charm , always useful , toxic pharmacy . 
Yes , Potter , poison , ' she added , her face flashing a smile . ' The poison and the antidote are very necessary subjects for the gods . 
And we have to say that Snape will definitely refuse to accept students who have earned the " Outstanding " OWL Certificate , so - 
Professor Umbridge coughed an extra signal . 
' Do you need a dose of cough , Dolores ? Professor McGonagall asked without looking at Professor Umbridge . 
' No , thank you very much , ' said Umbridge , with a silly laugh that Harry hated . ' I wonder if I can cut a little , Minerva ? ' 
" I'm sure you can , " Professor McGonagall said , teeth clenched . 
' I'm just wondering if Potter is qualified to be a goddess ? Professor Umbridge said sweetly . 
' Do you see that ? Professor McGonagall arrogantly said . ' So , Potter , ' she continued as if there was no interruption , ' if the game is serious , we should focus more on achieving progress in the Transfiguration and Toxic . 
I know that Professor Flitwick has given " Acceptable " and " Exceeds Expectations " for the past two years , so it looks like the subject The charm of the game is okay . 
On the subject of Anti - Art , the point of view is generally high , especially Professor Lupine thinks the game ... - Are you absolutely sure there is no need for a cough , Dolores ' 
' No , thank you , Minerva ; Professor Umbridge smiled silly and coughed louder than ever . ' I suppose you still do not have the latest Anti - Countigance artwork . 
I'm sure I put a comment on it . ' 
' Do you want to say this ? Professor McGonagall said , her voice suddenly changing as she pulled out a pink parchment in the papers jammed in Harry's Profile . 
She glanced up at it , her eyelashes slightly raised , then let it into place without comment . 
Well , as I said , Potter , Professor Lupine thinks that the game represents a remarkable temperament in this game , and obviously for a Light - 
' You do not understand my comment , Mrs. Minerva ? Professor Umbridge asked with a sweet voice , completely forgot about it . 
' Of course I understand , ' said Professor McGonagall , her teeth clenched , making her voice sound like hissing . 
' Ah , I'm so confused I'm afraid I do not understand how you can make a false hope for Potter - ' 
' Fake hope ? Professor McGonagall repeatedly refused to look at Professor Umbridge . ' Tró Porter scored high in all the Anti - Counting Arts exams - ' 
' I'm very sorry to deny what you say , Miss Minerva , but you can see my comment , Harry is getting very bad results in my class - ' 
' I have my own judgment , ' said Professor McGonagall , finally turning his head to look at Umbridge . ' The Porter Game has scored high on the Anti - Art Offensive exams by a qualified teacher . ' 
Professor Umbridge's smile went off like a light bulb exploded . 
She leaned back in her chair , flipped a sheet of paper in her clipboard and began to write very fast , her eyes peering from side to side . 
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry , smirking , his eyes flaming . 
' Any questions , Potter ? ' 
' Yes , ' said Harry . ' If you have all the necessary NEWT certifications , how will the Department have tests of personality and aptitude ? ' 
' Well , you have to be able to stand up for pressure and other things , ' said Professor McGonagall , ' as patiently and wholeheartedly , by training a Divine Light that will take up to three years . Just practice high - level skills in Defense . That means that even after graduation , you will have to learn a lot more , so if you intend to become the God of Light , you must be prepared to - 
' I think you ' ll find out too , ' said Umbridge in a very cold voice , ' I will look very carefully at the profile of those who want to be the God of Light . 
These judicial records . ' 
' - unless you are prepared to pass some other exams after graduating from Hogwarts , you should not really consider a career ... ' 
" This chance of becoming a god is as hopeless as the chance of Mr. Dumbledore to return to this school . ' 
' A very big opportunity , ' said Professor McGonagall . 
' Potter has a verdict , ' said Umbridge loudly . 
" The Potter game is pure , not guilty of any crime , " McGonagall said even louder . 
Professor Umbridge stood up . 
She was so short that the action did not change much as she was sitting , but her stylishly patterned jokes flickered the shadow of anger that made her face gaunt . looks sneaky strange . 
' Potter will never have the chance to become a god ! ' 
Professor McGonagall stood up , but for her it was much more impressive ; She is much higher than Professor Umbridge . 
' Potter , ' she said in a clear voice , ' I will help you to be a god of light if that's the last thing I can do ! 
If we add game at night , we are sure the game will achieve the results needed ! ' 
' The Ministry of Magic will never recruit people like Harry Potter ! Mrs. Umbridge said , her voice turning to anger . 
' Maybe we ' ll have a new minister when Potter is old enough to get involved ! Mrs. McGonagall shouted . 
' Ah ! Professor Umbridge yelled , pointing his short finger at Mrs. McGonagall . ' Right ! right , right , right ! 
Of course ! Is that what you want , Minerva McGonagall ? 
She wants Cornelius Fudge to be replaced by Albus Dumbledore ! 
You think she ' ll take my place , right ? She's going to kick me out of the Senior Assistant to the Minister and the Principal ! ' 
' You're delirious , ' said Professor McGonagall with disdain . ' Potter , we ended the career counseling here . ' 
Harry threw his briefcase over his shoulder and hurried out of the room , not daring to look at Professor Umbridge . 
He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continue screaming as she walked along the length of the corridor . 
Professor Umbridge was still panting as if racing as she strode into the Dark Arts Department room of them that afternoon . 
' I hope you're thinking carefully about what you're going to do , Harry , ' Hermione whispered as they opened their book , ' Chapter 34 , No Retaliation and Trafficking . ' ' Mrs. Umbridge looks like she's in a bad mood ' 
Mrs Umbridge frequently shot Harry with an angry look , while his head bowed low , staring at the Book of Anti - Magic Theory , his eyes focused on nothing as he was thinking . 
He could have imagined Professor McGonagall's reaction if he had been caught hacking into Professor Umbridge's office just hours after she'd protected it , preventing her from returning to Gryffindor House and hoping . a convenient occasion during the holiday 
It would be an opportunity to ask Sirius what time it was to be seen in The Sign of Nothing , except that the thought of the sensibility of action made it feel like there was a heavy rock in it . And the problem with the twins Fred and George , the two have completed the plan of distraction , not to mention the knife that Sirius gave it is now in place in the bag with the jacket . Invisible to him . 
But if it is caught 
' Dumbledore sacrificed himself so that he could stay in school , Harry ! " Hermione whispered , lifting the book so that Umbridge could not see her face . ' And if you get kicked out of school today , that sacrifice will become meaningless ! ' 
He can give up that plan and learn to live with memories of what he did on a summer day more than 20 years ago . 
And he remembered what Sirius had said while in the fire in the common room upstairs of the Gryffindor House . 
I do not like your children as much as you think dangerous is always a joke for James 
But does it still want to be like his father ? 
' Harry , do not do this , please do not do that ! " Said Hermione with a grave voice as the bell rang at the end of the session . 
It does not answer ; It does not know what to do . 
Ron seems to have decided not to give any opinion or advice ; He did not look at Harry , although Hermione opened her mouth to try to persuade Harry further , telling the gipsies , ' Can not you go ? 
He can decide for himself . ' 
Harry's heart pounded as he left the classroom . 
It was halfway through the corridor where the unmistakable sound was heard signaling a distraction plan had taken place . 
There were screams and screams from somewhere above ; Everyone ran out of the classroom to stop in the aisle and look at the fearful ceiling - 
Mrs. Umbridge ran out of the classroom as fast as her short legs allowed . 
Withdrawing the wand , she hurriedly ran in the opposite direction of the office : either now or never . 
' Harry - please do not ! ' Hermione pleaded weakly . 
But it was decided ; Clutching the pair of books firmly on his shoulders , he began to run erratically in the crowd of students who were hurrying in the opposite direction to see what was causing the loud noise in the east wing . 
Harry ran to the lobby of Umbridge's office and found no one there . 
Hunched behind a set of armor with a baseball cap around it , he opened his briefcase , took Siriuss's knife , and put on the Invisibility Cloak . 
After that , it crept slowly and carefully out of the hiding place behind the armor , walking along the corridor to Umbridge's office door . 
He sprays the knife blade into the door and slowly lifts it up and down , then pulls out . 
There was a small chirp , and the door opened . 
He sneaked into the room , quickly closing the door behind him and looking around . 
Nothing moves beyond the ugly cats playing around on the shelves above the confiscated broomsticks . 
Harry reached for the Invisibility Cloak , went to the fire , discovered what it needed for a few seconds : it was a small box of sparkling Floo . 
He bent down to the cold fireplace , his hands trembling . 
It has never done this before , even though it thinks it knows how it works . 
Raising his head on the heater , he picked up a large piece of powder and dropped it on the sticks stacked beneath it . 
They immediately flared up into a brilliant emerald green flame . 
' No . 12 , Grimmauld Square ! ' Harry said loudly and clearly . 
It is one of the most strange sensations it has experienced . 
Of course , it had been floating with Floo powder before , but then the whole body twisted and twirled inside the flames through the mantelpiece of the nation . 
This time , his knees were still kneeling on the cold floor of Umbridge's office , only his head was moving through the ghostly blue fire . 
And then , as suddenly as it began , the spinning process stopped . 
Feeling sick and as though he was wrapping a hot towel around his head , Harry opened his eyes , found himself looking through a fireplace in a kitchen and saw a long wooden table where a man mulling over a parchment . 
' Sirius ? ' 
The man jumped up and looked around . It was not Sirius , but Lupine . 
' Harry ! he said , looking very surprised . ' What are you doing - what's going on , is everything okay ? ' 
' Yes , ' said Harry . ' I was just wondering - I mean , I just wanted to talk to Sirius . ' 
' I ' ll call , ' said Lupine , walking away but still confused , ' he's up Kreacher , he seems to be hiding in the attic ' 
And Harry saw Lupine rush out of the kitchen . 
Now he sees nothing but the chair and the table legs . 
He wondered why Sirius never told him that talking through the fire was so inconvenient ; Her knees ached for a long time on the stone floor in Mrs. Umbridge's room . 
A moment later , Lupine turned back to Sirius with his heels . 
' What's up ? Uncle Sirius said impatiently , lifting his long black hair out of his eyes and knelt down in front of the fire so that he and Harry were on par with each other . 
Lupine knelt down , looking interested . ' Are you okay ? 
Can you help me ? ' 
' No , ' said Harry , ' it's not that I just want to talk about your father . ' 
They exchanged a look of surprise , but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or awkward ; Its knees are throbbing again and it's roughly 5 minutes have passed since the twins began to diverge ; George only guarantees it has 20 minutes . 
Therefore , it goes into the immediate story of what it saw in the Sign . 
When it was finished , neither Sirius nor Lupine spoke at all . 
Then , Lupine quietly said , ' I do not want you to judge my father for what you see , Harry . 
I was only 15 when - 
' I am also 15 years old ! Harry said impatiently . 
' Harry , ' said Sirius , ' Three James and Snape hated each other when they saw each other , it was just one of many reasons , do you understand ? 
He thought that James had everything Snape craved - three very famous children , very good at Quidditch - and so much more . 
And Mr. Snape is a very eccentric , always interested in Dark Art , and my three James - no matter how appearing under his eyes , Harry - always hated Art Dark . ' 
' Yes , ' said Harry , ' but you've attacked Snape without any good reason , just because - just because you said you were bored , ' it ended with a bite in his voice . to speak . 
' You are not proud of that , ' said Sirius quickly . 
Lupine turned to Sirius , and said , ' Harry , what do you have to understand is that the three of you and Sirius are the best at school - and people always think they are the best . as they are sometimes impulsive - ' 
' If we are sometimes arrogant arrogant , you're going to say that , ' said Sirius . 
Lupine smiled . 
' You make my hair dirty , ' Harry said in a miserable voice . 
Sirius and Lupine laughed . 
' You forgot , ' Sirius said , sounding impressed . 
' Are you playing with Snitch ? asked Lupine impatiently . 
' Yes , ' said Harry , looking at both of them with confused looks as Sirius and Lupine laughed and recalled the old story . " Well , I think they're just a bit stupid . ' 
' Of course he's a fool ! ' Sirius asserts , ' we are all idiots ! 
Hmm - do not dream anymore , ' he said clearly and looked at Lupine . 
But Lupine shook his head . ' Have I ever told you to let go of Snape ? he said . ' Have I ever had the courage to tell you that I think you are breaking the rules ? ' 
' Well then , ' said Sirius , ' sometimes you made us feel ashamed that it was something . ' 
" And , " said Harry impatiently , with determination to say things in his head , but because of the things that he was here , he looked at the girls across the lake , hope they are watching three ! ' 
" Well , my dad always makes me so stupid every time Lily is around , " said Sirius , shrugging his shoulders , " I can not stop myself from showing up when my three children are near my cheeks . ' 
' How did your mother agree to marry you ? Harry asked painfully . ' I hated three ! ' 
' Oh , that's not it , ' said Sirius . 
' My mother started out with three children in the seventh school year , ' said Lupine . 
' For the first time , James has cooled his head a bit , ' said Sirius . 
' And stop casting people just for fun , ' said Lupine . 
' Even to Snape ? ' Said Harry . 
' Hmm , ' said Lupine slowly , ' Snape is a special one . I mean , he never misses the chance to make a curse on James , and I do not really expect your three James to fail . ' 
' And did not your mother protest ? ' 
' You do not know much about it , actually , ' said Sirius . ' James never touched Snape on his mother's day and never made a spell in front of his mother . ' 
Sirius frowned at Harry , still looking half - suspicious . 
' You know , ' he said , ' Daddy is my best friend and my three are good people . 
There are a lot of idiots at 15 . 
You have overcome that . ' 
' Okay , ' said Harry heavily . ' Just because you never thought I would feel sorry for you again . ' 
' You are talking about Snape , ' said Lupine , a fatigue wrinkled between his eyebrows , ' how was he reacting when he discovered he had seen all that that ? ' 
' I tell you that you will never get up the path of the Magic Mantra , ' said Harry , ' as if it was a great disappointment to me - ' 
' What is he talking about ? " Sirius yelled , making Harry snap his shot and inhaling a mouthful of ash . 
' Are you serious , Harry ? Lupine said quickly . ' Do not you teach Snape ? ' 
' Yes , ' said Harry , very surprised by the reaction he felt was a bit excessive . ' But okay , I do not care , I can say you feel light ... 
- ' 
' You will go there to tell Snape ! ' Sirius said vigorously , and he jumped upright , but Lupine took a seat . 
' If someone needs to tell Snape , he must be me ! he said . ' But first Harry had to return to Snape and tell him there was no reason why he was allowed to stop those classes - if Dumbledore heard that - ' 
' I can not say that , Snape would kill me ! " Harry said angrily . ' I did not see Snape when we all came out of the Sign . ' 
' Harry , it's not as important as learning how to use my magic ! said Lupine sternly . ' Do you understand ? 
Nothing is more important ! ' 
' Yes , yes , ' said Harry , completely embarrassed . 
You will try and say something to Snape but it will not - 
It fell silent . 
He could hear footsteps . 
' Are not Mr. Kreacher down the ladder ? ' 
' No , ' said Sirius after glancing back . ' There must be somebody there . ' 
Harry's heart stopped beating . 
You should go ! ' Harry hurriedly said and took his head off the fire at Grimmauld Square . 
For a moment , his head twisted around his shoulders , then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fireplace and watching the flames flame and die . 
' Hurry hurry ! ' he heard a voice outside the door . ' Oh , she left the door open - ' 
Harry hid in the Invisibility Cloak and tried to pull it all over himself when Filch rushed into the room . 
He was obviously looking for something and talking to himself impatiently as he passed the room , pulled the drawer at Umbridge's desk and began rummaging through the papers . 
' Approve penalties for sanctions The last time we can do that , they ' ll remember that year ' 
He pulled out a roll of paper , kissed it , then hurried to the door , still holding the paper rolls in front of his chest . 
Harry rushed out , checking for sure that he was holding the pair of books and the Invisibility Cloak completely covered him , opening the door and hurrying out of the office behind Filch , who was walking at a very fast pace . never seen Harry . 
Out of Umbridge's office , Harry thought it safe to be back . 
He took off the Invisibility Cloak , tucked it into his briefcase and continued running . 
There was a lot of shouting and movement from the Hall . 
It ran down the stairs and it seemed like the whole school was gathering there . 
It was like the night Miss Trelawney was fired . 
The students leaned against the surrounding walls in a large circle ( Harry noticed that some were stuck in something all over the place , much like Stinksap ) ; the teachers and the ghosts also stand in the crowd . 
Out of the audience were members of the Test Team , all of whom were very pleased with themselves , and Peeves , who were hovering overhead , stared at Fred and George Standing in the middle of the floor with no sin but being cornered . 
' How ! Umbridge said with triumph . 
Harry noticed that she was just standing there with a few steps ahead , looking down at her prey . ' What - is it funny how fun it is to turn a school hallway into a dressing room ? ' 
' Very funny , right , ' Fred said , looking up at her with no fear . 
Filch knuckles elbow to approach Umbridge , nearly bursting into tears for happiness . 
' I have this text , Principal , ' he said hoarsely , waving the parchment that Harry had seen from the table . ' I've got this text and I have some dingy skin , let me do it . ' 
' Very good , Argus , ' she said . ' Either way , ' she continued , staring at Fred and George , ' will have to get acquainted with what is going to happen to those who do wrong in our school . ' 
' What do you know ? ' Fred said . ' I do not think we ' ll get used to it . ' 
She returned to the twin brother . 
' George , ' Fred said , ' I think we've learned enough . ' 
' Yes , I feel the same way , ' George said brightly . 
It is time to test our intelligence with the rest of the world , do you see that ? ' Fred asked . 
' Absolutely correct , ' said George . 
And before Umbridge could say a word , they raised their wands and said , 
' Come back here ! ' 
Harry heard the noise somewhere far away . 
Looking to the left , he crouched down at the right time . 
The broomsticks of Fred and George , one still dragging in chains and the iron hook that Umbridge used to tie them to the wall , were hovering rumbling along the corridor toward their master ; We turned left , slid down the stairs and stopped right in front of the twins , the chains jerking and clattering loudly on the slate floor . 
' We will not see you again , ' Fred said to Professor Umbridge , shrugging his legs on the broom . 
' Yes , we will not bother to contact you again , ' George said and rode up to his broomstick . 
Fred looked around at the students gathered , silent and watching intently . 
' If anyone wants to buy a pocket marsh , as seen in the back , go to number 93 , Diagon Alley - Weasleys ' Shop Wizarding Wheezes , ' he said loudly . ' Our new shelter ! ' 
' Special discounts for Hogwarts students are committed to using our products to get rid of this old bat , ' added George , pointing to Professor Umbridge . 
' Stop them ! Umbridge growled , but it was too late . 
Before the investigation team could stop them , Fred and George got out of the door , leaping up to 15 feet into the air , the iron hook hovering dangerously below . 
Fred glanced across the hall to the goblin that floated to him at the top of the crowd . 
' Send her hell from us , Peeves . ' 
And Peeves , whom Harry had never seen following a student's earlier words , dropped his bell - cap from his head to say goodbye as Fred and George hovered over loud applause . of the students underneath and flew to the front door open under the brilliant sunset . 
Chapter 30 : Grawp 
In the days that followed , the story of a freighter flight of brothers Fred and George was recounted on a regular basis , to the extent that Harry could assert that it would soon become part of the The legend of Hogwarts School : Within a week or so , even students who had seen the event personally were so convinced that they almost believed themselves to have seen twin brothers bombing . down on Mrs. Umbridge from the broom and pour down her like rain of fecal bombs before escaping the door . 
The immediate consequence of the escape was an endless wave of debate about imitating them . 
Harry often hears the students say things like , " Sometimes I really want to jump on the broom and get out of here , " or , " Just one more lesson , I will follow the path of the Weasley brothers . " 
Fred and George can be sure no one has forgotten them too soon . 
Only one thing , they did not leave instructions on how to get rid of the swamp now lying in the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing . 
Umbridge and Filch tried to find a way to make it disappear but there was no success . 
Finally , the area was covered with strings and Mr. Filch , with his grinding teeth , had to take on a rowing job carrying students across that swamp to the classroom . 
Harry is certain that teachers such as McGonagall or Flitwick may be able to move the marsh at a glance , but in the case of the harassment of the twins Fred and Georges , they seem to like watching Umbridge struggle . more . 
There were two broomsticks on Umbridge's office door , through which two , Fred's and George's Cleansweeps bubbled to return to reunite with their masters . 
Filch installed a new door to replace and brought Harry's Lightning Broom to a new storage facility , which , according to rumors , Umbridge arranged an armed giant to guard it . 
However , the problems she encountered are far from over . 
Despite the example of Fred and George , a large number of students are still competing to occupy the vacant position - becoming the first person to play the game . 
Although the new door had been replaced , someone was still tucking up an umbrella at Umbridge's office , which shuffled the room up to find sparkling objects . I stepped in and tried to snatch the rings out of her short fingers . 
Feces and rotten plastic bullets fall like rain on the corridors , so students form a habit of kicking their balloons before leaving the classroom to ensure there is enough fresh air , though . Those balls made them look weird looking like they were topping up fish tanks upside down . 
Filch lurked in the corridors , hand over a whipping horse , trying desperately to catch the offenders , but the problem was that there were so many of them that he did not know how to handle it . any . The Examination Team tries to help the teacher , but there are always abnormalities with the team members . 
Warrington from the Slytherin Quidditch team was taken to a clinic with a terrible skin condition that made it look like it was covered with popcorn ; Pansy Parkinson , already 
It made Hermiones very happy when it dropped all the lessons of the next day because of the sudden growth of a pair of horns . 
Meanwhile , it was clear that Fred and George had sold a lot of Snack Skiings before leaving Hogwarts . 
Umbridge entered a classroom where only students were fainted , vomiting , severe fever or bleeding from both nostrils . Frustrated by the anger and helplessness , she tried to find the cause of the unexplained symptoms , but the students still stubbornly tried to tell her that they were experiencing a symptom . Called " Umbridge Syndrome " . 
After being sentenced to four consecutive classes without being able to discover their secret , she was forced to abandon the investigation and allowed a series of students to bleed , faint and vomit from the classroom . learn . 
However , not only the users of the Snackboxes are competing to become the first , the Peeves seem to have engraved Fred's words into their hearts . 
Giggling , it fluttered around the school , overturned the tables , blasted the blackboards , spilled statues and pots ; Two times she locked up Mrs. Norris in a suit of armor , so that when the supervisor rescued screamed loudly . 
The Peeves smashed into lantern lanterns and blew out the candles , juggling the burning torches on the students ' screaming heads , making the piles of neatly folded paper fall into the fire . or throw out the window ; cause a second floor flood when it opens all the faucets in the bathroom , drop a bag full of black spiders in the middle of the hall while students are eating breakfast and , when it wants to relax , it drains It took hours after Umbridge and scorned her tongue when she spoke . 
None of the teachers except Mr. Filch seemed willing to lift her hand . 
Not that , a week after Fred and George's escape , Harry saw Professor McGonagall passing by the Peeves trying to unplug the crystal shimmer and he could swear he heard the professor exclaim . with the goblin through a corner , " must turn it back on . " 
In addition , Montague had not recovered from the toilet ; It was still very scared and disoriented , and people saw her cheeks striding up the aisle on a Tuesday morning , looking very angry . 
" Should we say something ? " Hermione said nervously , her cheeks pressed against the Charmed door to see the Montague brothers coming in . " What happened to him ? 
If it could help Pomfrey cure him ? " 
" Of course not , it will not , " Ron said in a low voice . 
" Anyway , let's add Umbridge to that , are not we ? " Harry said in a satisfying voice . 
Both it and Ron are using wands to tap on tea cups to cast spells . 
Harry's cup sprouted so short that he could not reach the table and stirred up in the air . 
Ron's cup grows out of his soft legs , and they cup the tea off the table with great difficulty , sloping down a few seconds and folding it down and making the cup split in half . 
" Reparo , " Hermione said quickly , and tied the fragments of a waving wand . " Of course , but what if Montague would never recover ? " 
" Who cares ? " Ron snapped , while his cup of coffee stood up again like a drunken man , shivering in his knees . " Did not Montague do enough for Gryffindor ? 
If you want to worry about someone , think of me , Hermione ! " 
" You , " she said , while grabbing her tea cup as she jumped around happily through the table on four sturdy willow legs and placed it in front of her . " Why should I worry about you ? " 
" When your letter passed Umbridge's examination , " said Ron sourly , now clutching his teacup while his limp limbs were trying to help him with his weight . Its volume , " I ' ll really be in trouble . 
I would not be surprised if my mother sent a Thunder Letter . " 
" But - " 
" That would be my fault for letting Fred and George go , and you ' ll see , " Ron said somberly . " I will say I should stop him doing that , I should grab his broomstick and pull or do the same thing right , that would be his fault . " 
" Eh , if your cheeks do that then it's unfair , you can not do anything ! 
But I'm sure your cheeks will not do that , I mean , if they really have a place to stay in Diagon Alley , they must have been planning a long time already . " 
" Yes , but there's another thing , how do they get there ? " Said Ron , knocking the wand into a cup of tea , causing his legs to collapse and clench in front of him . it . " Are they really scoundrels right ? There must be loads of Galleons to rent a spot at Diagon Alley . 
She would like to know what he has done to get that gold . " 
" That's right , I was wondering , too , " said Hermione , as he ordered his tea cup to jump around Harry's cup of tea , his short legs still unable to reach the table , " I Asked if Mundungus had persuaded them to sell stolen items or similar things . " 
" It's not him , " said Harry curtly . 
" How do you know ? " Ron and Hermione said in unison . 
" Because - " Harry hesitated , but the moment of confession finally came . 
Being silent would be a bad thing if that meant someone would suspect Fred and George were criminals . " I gave them gold , I gave them all the trophies that I received last June . " 
There was a stunned silence , then Hermione's cup of tea leapt past the edge of the table and fell to the floor . 
" Oh , Harry , you can not do that ! " She said . 
" Yes , I did , " Harry said rebelliously . " And I do not regret it . 
I do not need that amount of gold and they really want a mess . " 
" But that would be great , " said Ron , looking very moved . " It's all up to you , Harry - I can not blame myself ! 
Can I tell you ? " 
" Well , I hope you get better , " said Harry gloomily , " especially if your mother thinks he's eating stolen cauldron or something . " 
Hermione said nothing during the rest of the class , but Harry suspected that her self - restraint would definitely explode . 
That suspicion was confirmed as soon as they left the castle for a break and stood under the pale sun of May , she stared at Harry with small , bright eyes , determinedly opening her mouth . 
Harry stopped before she could open her mouth . 
" You nagged me not to be helpful , everything happened , " he said firmly . " Fred and George have been holding gold - they have spent a lot - I can not and do not want to get back . 
So you do not have to , Hermione . " 
" I'm not going to say anything about Fred and George ! " She said in a hurt voice . 
Ron snorted in disbelief and Hermione gave him a nasty look . 
" I'm not going to say that ! " She said angrily . " In fact , I was going to ask Harry when he'd come back to Snape and ask him to do more about Occlumency ! " 
Harry's heart sank . 
As soon as they ran out of stories about the dramatic escape of Fred and George , the story spent so many hours , Ron and Hermione wanted to hear Sirius's news . 
And because Harry had never told his friends why he wanted to talk to Sirius right away , it was hard to make out anything to tell them ; It finishes the story honestly that Sirius wants Harry to return to Occlumency . 
Now it regrets it more than ever ; Hermione will never let go of the subject and will always come back to it when she least expected . 
" You do not have to tell me you're no longer euphoric , " said Hermione , " because Ron told me you were talking in the middle of the night . " 
Harry threw Ron an angry look . 
Ron looked embarrassed . 
" You just say it for a moment , " he murmured with apologies . " Something like " just a little more " . " 
" I dream of watching you play Quidditch , " Harry lied flatly . " I try to remind you to reach out a little more to catch the Quaffle ball . " 
Ron's ears flushed red . 
Harry felt a little satisfied because of revenge ; Of course , it does not dream of anything like that . 
Last night , he dreamed that he was walking down the corridor to the Office of the Spirit . 
It went through a round room , then the room filled with noise and dancing lights , finally found itself in the room looked like a cave filled with shelves , on which folded glass spheres . 
He rushed straight to the number ninety - seven , turned left and ran along that shelf . It was obviously loud enough just because he felt he was about to wake up and before he reached the end of the line . He found himself lying on the bed , staring at the top of the four - poster bed . 
" Are you trying to defend your mind ? " Hermione said while looking at Harry intently . " Are you still practicing the Phong Shui ? " 
" Of course , " said Harry , trying to get his voice sounding offended by the question . 
Actually , it is very questionable about what is hidden in the room filled with such dusty balls that it so desperately wants those dreams to continue . 
The problem is that I have less than a month to go to the exams and they have to spend all their time to revise their work , their minds seem to be saturated by the exercises so when they go to bed , they notice it's hard to sleep well ; and when it fell asleep , its overloaded brain just dreamed of absurd dreams about exams . 
He also suspected that part of it - the part of Hermione's voice - felt guilty when it came to the end of the corridor where the door was black and tried to wake it up before it reached its destination . 
" You know , " said Ron as his ears were red , " if Montague can not recover before the Slytherin and Hufflepuff games , we will have the chance to win the cup . " 
" Yes , I think so too , " said Harry , who was glad to change the subject . 
" Because we won a game and lost a game - if the Slytherin lost to Hufflepuff on Saturday - " 
" That's right , " said Harry , completely oblivious to what he was agreeing with . 
Cho Chang just passed the small yard without looking at it . 
* 
This year's final Quidditch match , Gryffindor against the Ravenclaws , took place on the last weekend of May . 
Although the Slytherins were beaten up by the Hufflepuffs in the final match , the Gryffindor did not dare much to win , mainly because of Ron's awful defensive record ( though of course nobody said ) . that's with it ) . 
However , it seems very optimistic . 
" I mean , I can not get any worse , is it ? " he told Harry and Hermione in a clear morning voice in the morning of the match . " Nothing to lose ? " 
" You know , " said Hermione , as she and Harry went down to the court , flailing in the crowd excitedly , " I think Ron will be better off when Fred and George are not there . 
He never makes him feel confident . " 
Luna Lovegood catches up to them with a raw bean on their head . 
" I'm dead , I forgot ! " Hermione said as she watched the eagle flutter as Luna walked past a Slytherin crowd giggling and pointing . " Do you play this game ? " 
Harry , who completely forgot about this , just murmured something unclear . 
They found seats in the top row of the stands . 
Beautiful and clear ; Ron could not wish for anything better , and Harry felt a hope that Ron would not make the excuse for the Slytherins to repeat the chorus . " Weasley is our king . " 
Lee Jordan , who has been completely deaf since Fred and George's departure , is reporting on a routine basis . 
When the two teams go out , it reads the name of each player but the voice is not as exciting as ever . 
" Bradley Davies Chang , " he said , and Harry felt his stomach start to mumble , like being hit and shocked when Cho came out , her shiny black hair flying in the breeze . . 
He does not want anything except one that he does not stand in the stands . 
Even the way she looked at the heated discussion with Roger Davies as they prepared for the broom also made it throbbing with jealousy . 
" And the game starts ! " Lee said . " And Davies caught the Quaffle right away , the Ravenclaw Davies captain holding the Quaffle , dodging Johnson , Bell , and even Spinnet heading for the goal ! 
He threw the ball - and - and - " Lee shouted " and he scored . " 
Harry and Hermione moaned along with all Gryffindors students . 
As expected , the Slytherin crowd on the other side of the stage began to sing : 
" Weasley can not protect a limb . 
It can not hide a tiny ring ... " 
" There was a hoarse voice in his ear . " Hermione " 
Harry looked around and saw Hagrid's bearded face among the sitting men . 
Obviously , she struggled to get through the lower row , because the first and second year students looked at them as they were passing by . 
For some reason , Hagrid bent down as if afraid of being seen by anyone , though he was still standing over at least four feet . 
" Listen , " he whispered , " can you come with me ? 
Right now ? 
While everyone is watching the match ? " 
" Can not you be late , Miss Hagrid ? " asked Harry . 
Until the game is over ? " 
" No , " said Hagrid . " No , Harry , right now while everyone is focusing on something else , please ? " 
Hagrid's nose is bleeding . 
My eyes are dark . 
Harry had never seen her so much since he returned to school ; I look completely brainless . 
" Of course , " said Harry immediately , " of course we will go with you . " 
He and Hermione walked down the aisle of their seats , the students standing up to give way to the grunts . 
The others at Hagrid's stand are not complaining but just trying to get as small as possible . 
" You are very grateful to me , both of you , really , " said Hagrid as they reached the stairs . 
Uncle often rolled his eyes around with anxiety as they descended below . " I just hope she does not notice us leaving . " " 
" Did you mean Umbridge ? " Said Harry . " She did not notice , she was sitting with the crowd in the Examination Team , did not you see ? 
She must have been expecting trouble in the match . " 
" Oh , yes , a little bit of trouble will not hurt , " said Hagrid , stopping for a moment to check around to make sure the lawn between the pitch and his hut was completely empty . " We will have more time . " 
" What's wrong , Hagrid ? " Hermione said , looking at her with obvious concern on their faces as they hurried across the grass to the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
" You ' ll know right away , " Uncle Hagrid said , looking over his shoulder as there was a loud scream from the crowd behind them . " Hey - looks like somebody has just scored . " 
" It must be Ravenclaw , " said Harry heavily . 
" Good job , " said Hagrid hastily . 
Damage is good " 
They trotted along the back of the lawn , carefully looking around each step . 
When they reached Hagrid's tent , Hermione turned left to the front door . 
Hagrid , however , skipped the hut , going straight into the darkness of the trees at the edge of the Forbidden Forest , where he picked up his cradle and leaned against a tree . 
When I realized that the kids did not follow me , I came back . 
" Let's go in here , " he said , clawing his hair back . 
" To the Forbidden Forest ? " Hermione said in confusion . 
" Yes , " said Hagrid . " Let's go , hurry , before someone follows us ! " 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , then wandered under the trees , following Hagrid , who had left them far away in the darkness of the blue , the one in his hands . 
Harry and Hermione followed him to catch up . 
" Hagrid , why are you carrying a weapon ? " Said Harry . 
" Just stay away , " said Hagrid , shrugging his shoulders . 
" I did not bring your uncle on the day you showed us the horses with wings Thestrals , " said Hermione timidly . 
" Because we're going to go a lot further , " said Hagrid . " And anyway , that day also happened before Firenze left the Forbidden Forest ? " 
" Why did Mr. Firenze's departure from the Forest make things different ? " Asked Hermione curiously . 
" Because the other centaurs were uncooperative , " Hagrid said quietly , still glancing around . " They have - well , can not be called friendly - but we're all set to work together . " 
We make friends , but they always change their attitude every time we want a prophecy . 
Not a word anymore . " 
He sighed . 
" Firenze said they were angry because he left to work for Dumbledore , " said Harry , stumbling upon a root rising from the ground as he watched his story . 
" Yes , " said Hagrid harshly . " Yes , anger can not be described at all . 
Ruddy angry purple liver gut . 
If you do not go there , I think they kicked Mr. Firenze to death - " 
" They beat him ? " Hermione said , her voice very stunned . 
" Yes , " said Hagrid gruffly , and turned the path through the branches that grew near the ground . " Half a dozen of them rushed at him . " 
" And you stopped it ? " Said Harry , incredulous in his eyes and impressed . " Alone ? " 
" Of course he stopped , how could he stand watching them kill him ? " Said Hagrid . " Fortunately , you passed by that time and I think that Mr. Firenze can remember it when he started sending you stupid warnings ! " She suddenly added with a furious look . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , startled , but Hagrid , still very angry , did not elaborate . 
" Anyway , " he said , breathing heavier than usual , " after that , the centaurs were very angry with you , and the trouble was that they had a lot of influence in this Forbidden Forest . They are the most intelligent creatures here . " 
" That's why we're here , Miss Hermione ? " asked Hermione . " Is it because of the centaurs ? " 
" Oh , no , " said Hagrid , shaking his head strongly , " no , not because of them . 
Of course , they can complicate things , but you ' ll know right away . " 
After that unspoken sentence , I silently moved forward , striding with long strides at three times their feet making them very hard to keep up with him . 
The paths grew denser , the trees grew close as they advanced further into the obscure Forest as the sky turned dark . 
They had crossed the empty place where Uncle Hagrid had pointed out to the young horses of the Thestrals at a distance , but Harry did not feel disturbed until Uncle Hagrid stepped out of the trail and walked around the trees . heading towards the murky center of the Forbidden Forest . 
" Hagrid , " said Harry , as he turned a dense bush that Hagrid walked over to take the path , and remembered very well what had happened to him at the time he walked out of the path of the District . Forbidden Forest . " Where are we going ? " 
" Just a little more , " said Hagrid over his shoulder . " Come on , Harry we need to get close to each other . " 
Hagrid , trying to catch up with the branches and bushes that Hagrid walked through as easily as if they were spider webs , kept on the clothes of Harry and Hermione , often clinging to them . They have to stop for a few minutes . 
Harry's feet are quickly filled with cuts and scratches . 
Now , they are very deep in the woods , occasionally , Harry can only see Hagrid's dark shadow in the darkness ahead . 
Any sound seemed threatening in this stifling silence . 
The twanging of the branches was loud and the smallest scuffle , even though it was only a sparrow's involuntary motion that made Harry look at the darkness for the cause . 
It occurred to him that he had never tried to go into the Forbidden Forest without seeing any creatures ; The absence of forest creatures impresses it as an ominous sign . 
" Hagrid , can we light the wand ? " Hermione said quietly . 
" Well , " Hagrid whispered . " The truth is - " 
Uncle suddenly stopped and turned back ; Hermione walked behind her and was pushed back . 
Harry grabs hold of her before Hermione falls . 
" Maybe we should pause a little , " so that you can ... explain to the children , " said Hagrid . " Before we go there . " 
" That's great ! " said Hermione as Harry helped her up . 
Both whispered " Lumos ! " And their heads flashed . 
Hagrid's face was clearly visible from the dark with the two beams of light , and Harry noticed that he seemed tense and sad . 
" This , " " Uncle Hagrid said . " Well , let's see what the story is " 
She was breathing hard . 
" You have to tell me you can be fired at any time , " he said . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other then looked at him . 
" But you've delayed that for a long time - " Hermione said hesitantly . " What makes you think - " 
" Umbridge thinks you've dropped the minnow into her office . " 
" Is that right ? " Said Harry , before he could stop . 
" No , definitely not ! " Said Hagrid indignantly . " Anything that involves mysterious creatures , she thinks , is related to him , and they know she's always looking for a chance to get rid of her soon after she returns . 
I do not want to go anywhere , of course , but if it's not a special situation , I have to explain to you ... well , maybe you have to leave now , before she finds The excuse for dismissing him in front of the whole school , like she did with Trelawney . " 
Neither Harry nor Hermione protested , but Hagrid waved his large hand in unconcern for their opinion . 
" It's not the end of the world , you can help Dumbledore if he's out of here , he can be useful to the Brotherhood . 
And they have Grubbly - Plank , oh ... and - and they will pass the exam . " 
His voice trembled and broke . 
" Do not worry about me , " she said hurriedly as Hermione patted her arm . 
He pulled out a large scarf from his pocket and used it to wipe his eyes . " Well , I will not let you know this if you are not forced to do so . 
Well , if you go , you can not go without telling someone because the doctor needs ... uh ... the kids help you . 
Ron , if he wants to . " 
" Of course we will help you , " said Harry immediately . " What do you want us to do ? " 
Hagrid snorted loudly , and slapped Harry on the shoulder , causing him to bump into a tree . 
" You know ... uhh ... you ' ll say yes , " said Hagrid through the towel , " but I ' ll never forget just a little more , have the nettle " 
They continued to walk in silence for another fifteen minutes ; Harry was about to open his mouth to ask how far they were going , when Hagrid raised his hand and motioned for them to stop . 
" Very easy , " she said softly . " It's so quiet , 
They stepped forward and Harry saw a large , soft soot near Hagrid , making him feel certain , with a dreaded shock , that must have been the lair of a beast . somehow 
The trees around the pile were rooted up , causing the pile to lie on a bare ground , surrounded by many trees and branches creating a fence or obstacle , after row Harry , Hermione and Hagrid are standing . 
" Sleeping , " Hagrid breathed . 
Without a doubt , Harry could hear a rattling , distant sound that seemed to emanate from his two huge lungs in action . 
He glanced to Hermione , who was staring at the mound , his mouth slightly open . 
She looked terrified . 
" Uncle Hagrid , " the little girl whispered in a low voice in the sound of the sleeping creature , " who is he ? " 
Harry realized that was a strange question " what is that ? " Is the question that he is asking . 
" Hagrid , you told us - " Hermione said , her wand shaking in her hand , " you told us that none of them wanted to go ! " 
Harry looked away from her to Hagrid , and then , aware of the problem , he looked back at the pile , gasping for fear . 
The huge heap , which Hermione and Hagrid could easily stand up to , was now moving up and down slowly , with deep and heavy breathing . That's not a mound . that is clearly the back of a ... - 
" No - it does not want to come here either , " said Hagrid , sounding desperate . " But you have to take it , Hermione , I'm forced to do that ! " 
" But why ? " Hermione asked , her voice sounding like crying . " Why - for what - oh my god , Hagrid " 
" I think if you bring it back here , " said Hagrid , his voice was very much like preparing to cry , " and - and giving him some things - I think he can give it to everyone . And show them it's completely harmless ! " 
" Harmless ! " Hermione hissed , and Hagrid hurriedly raised her hand to block her voice as the creature in front of them muttered and shifted while sleeping . " He has hurt you all the time , so that's why you got all those wounds ! " 
" He does not know his own power ! " Said Hagrid seriously . " And it's getting better , it does not do much anymore - " 
" So that's why it took me two months to get home ! " Hermione said angrily . " Oh my gosh , Hagrid , why did you bring him away when he did not want to ? 
Would he be happier if he lived with people like him ? " 
" They all bullied it , Hermione , " because it was too small ! " Hagrid said . 
" Little girl ? " Said Hermione . " Small baby ? " 
" Hermione , I can not leave it alone , " said Hagrid , his tears streaming down his beard now . " That is - hic - it's your brother ! " 
Hermione just stared at her , her mouth open . 
Uncle Hagrid , you say , " brother , " Harry slowly said , " your mind is - " 
" Oh , my mother , " Hagrid corrected . 
Your mother took another giant after she left her father , she left and gave birth to Grawp there - " 
" Grawp ? " Said Harry . 
" Yes , that is the sound that almost looks like when he says his name , " Hagrid said anxiously . " It does not speak much English is Uncle trying to teach it anyway , his cheeks do not seem to like it , like he does . 
Among the giants , what makes people respect and appreciate is the birth of huge babies , and it is always said to be stunted - just 16 feet tall - " 
" Yeah , yeah , really small ! " Hermione said with a little sneer . " Obviously baby ! " 
" They all treated it badly - you can not let it stay - " 
" So Maxime wants to bring him along ? " Harry asked . 
" She - well , she knows this is very important to you , " said Hagrid , wriggling his hands . " Like " - but " for a while she ... 
Oh ... a little tired of it , I have to admit it so we split up on the return trip she promised not to tell anyone else " 
" How did you bring him here without anyone paying attention ? " Said Harry . 
" Well , that's why it took a lot of time , you know , " said Hagrid . " We can only go at night and go through wilderness in the wilderness . 
Of course , it can easily hide itself very well when it wants to , but it still wants to come back . " 
" Oh my gosh , Hagrid , why do not you let him do that ! " Hermione said , letting go of a tree that had been uprooted and buried her face in her hands . " What do you think you can do with a fierce giant while he does not want to be here ? " 
" Well , now - " fierce " - that's a little too tight , " said Hagrid , still twisting his hands . 
Until now I have to admit that it can shove you a little when it is not happy , but it will be quite up , quite a lot of it , its temper will be lower . " 
" So what are these ropes for ? " Asked Harry . 
It suddenly dawned on me that there were large ropes like small trunks tied around the largest trees nearby and ran back to where Grawp lay quivering on the ground , turning his back on them . 
" You have to tie him up ? " Hermione said timidly . 
" Oh , " said Hagrid , looking anxious . " It's not - as you said - it does not know the true power of yourself . " 
Harry understood why there was a lack of suspicious noise from the living in this area of ​​ the Forbidden Forest . 
" What do you want Harry , Ron and what do you do now ? " Asked Hermione anxiously . 
" Take care of it , " said Hagrid in a mournful voice . " After you go away . " 
Harry and Hermione exchanged misery , and Harry realized that it was too uncomfortable that he had promised Hagrid what he would do . 
" So what exactly do we have to do ? " Hermione asked . 
" No food or anything ! " " Uncle Hagrid said eagerly . " He can get his own food , absolutely no problem . 
Any bird or deer , all he needs is a companion . 
If you know someone is still trying to help it ... er ... teach him to know . " 
Harry did not say anything but turned to look at the gigantic figure sleeping drunk on the ground in front of them . 
Unlike Hagrid , who looks like a normal person but is too big , Grawp does not look slim . 
What Harry looked like was a huge moss covered rock on the left side of that huge mound that he now realized was the head of a man named Grawp . 
Compared with the average person , the head is not proportionate and seems too large for the body , it is almost round , covered with curly hair growing spasmodically . 
The huge pink rose ear can be seen at the top of the head , the head seems , like Uncle Vernon , lying on the shoulders and the neck almost short or not . 
His broad back is covered with a kind of dirty brown that looks like a piece of animal skin stuck awkwardly back together ; And because the creature named Grawp is sleeping , it looks like the rails are about to burst out . 
The legs folded under the body . 
Harry could see his bare feet , dirty , feet on the ground of the Forbidden Forest . 
" You want us to teach him , " said Harry in a voice that was not sincere . 
He understood what Mr. Firenze's warning meant . 
His efforts will not work . 
He is better off giving up . 
Of course the other Centaurs living in the Forbidden Forest would have heard Hagrid's futile efforts to teach English Grawp . 
" Oh - you just need to talk to him a bit , " said Hagrid hopefully . " Because , I suppose if she could talk to people , she would understand that everyone liked it and wanted it to stay . " 
Harry looked at Hermione , who was looking back at him with his fingers crossed on his face . 
" It's just like having a treat for Norbert staying with us , right ? " She said , and she burst out laughing . 
" Will you help me ? " Said Hagrid , not seeming to grasp the meaning of Harry's words . 
" We will , " said Harry , bound by promise . " We ' ll try , Hagrid . " 
" You know I can rely on you , Harry , " Hagrid said , smiling with tears in his eyes and rubbed his face with a towel . " And I do not want you to go out too much , you know you have tests too if you can come here in Cloak ... once a week ... er and talk to it . 
You will wake him up , okay ? - to introduce you - " 
" What - do not ! " Said Hermione , jerking her . " Hagrid , do not , do not wake him up , it's not necessary - " 
But Hagrid walked over the big tree in front of them and approached Grawp . 
When she was about ten feet away , she picked up a long , broken branch on the ground , smiling at Harry and Hermione over her shoulder , staring at Grawp in the middle with her head . 
The giant emits a roar that rattles the still - quiet atmosphere of the Forbidden Forest ; Birds flying from the top of the tree fly overboard and panic . 
Meanwhile , in front of Harry and Hermione , the giant named Grawp has risen from the ground at this moment of shivers as he fights a giant hand to the ground to kneel on his knees . 
He turned his head to see what was disturbing him . 
" Good , Grawpy ? " Hagrid said in a tone of affection , utterly uninterested in the rising tree , ready to push Grawp one more time . " Do you sleep well ? " 
Harry and Hermione backed away as far as they could and still saw the giant . 
Grawp knelt between two trees that he had not yet spat . 
They looked up at his big face with astonishment as it looked like a blue moon swimming on the dark background . 
It looks like it has been cut from a large round . 
The nose is short and swollen , the mouth deviating from one side and full of golden teeth , the odd shape is about half the size of a brick ; His small eyes are blue and opaque in color , and now he's eyes closed with sleep . 
Grawp raised his dirty fingers with a cricket ball , and then , without warning , stood up very quickly . 
" Oh dear ! " Harry heard Hermione screech up beside him . 
The trees were wrapped in ropes and the other end was tied around Grawp's wrists and ankles screaming scary . 
He , as Hagrid said , at least 16 feet tall . 
Glancing around blankly , Grawp raised a hand of the size of an umbrella of sun umbrellas , grabbed a bird's nest on a tall tree branch of the pine , slanted it back down and snarled . There are no birds in it ; the egg fell to the bottom and Uncle Hagrid raised his hand to cover his head to protect himself . 
" Grawpy , " exclaimed Hagrid , as he looked up anxiously for fear of falling again , " I brought some little friends here to meet you . 
Remember , you said you could ? 
Do you remember , when you said that you might have to go a little further and ask them to take care of you ? 
Remember not , Grawpy ? " 
But Grawp only uttered low growls ; It is hard to say whether he listened to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sound of his voice . 
Now , he grabbed the top of the pine tree and pulled it toward him , seemingly pleased to see how far it could turn back when he released it . 
" Grawpy , do not do that ! " Exclaimed Hagrid . " do not pull the trees " 
Without a doubt , Harry could hear the sound of the ground around the root of the tree . 
" I brought you here ... 
Oh ... so ! " Uncle Hagrid shouted . " Hey , look ! 
Look down here , boy , you brought some people here ! " 
" Oh , Hagrid , do not , " Hermione moaned , but Hagrid held up the branch and poked at Grawp's knee . 
The giants let go of the tree , the shaking tree looked so disturbing , and pouring down the needle - like leaves of Hagrid , and he looked down . 
" Here , " said Hagrid , pointing to Harry and Hermione standing , " is Harry , Grawp ! 
Harry Potter ! 
He will come here to see you ... er ... if you have to leave , understand ? " 
Only then , the giants realized that Harry and Hermione were standing there . 
They watched with great anxiety as he lowered his head like a giant rock so that he could see them more clearly with a blank look . 
" This is Hermione , see ? 
" Hagrid hesitated . 
Turning to Hermione , she said , " Would you mind if she called me Hermy ? 
It will be hard to remember your name . " 
" Oh no , no , " Hermione hissed . 
" This is Hermy , Grawp ! 
And she will come here too ! To 
Hey ? 
Two friends - GRAWPY , NO ! " 
Grawp's hand pops out suddenly at Hermione ; Harry grabs her backwards behind the tree , causing Grawp to get caught in the trunk and into the air . 
" Ugh , GRAWPY ! " They heard Hagrid yell as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree , shivering and whimpering . " Very bad ! , do not do that - okay ! " 
Harry poked his head out from behind the tree and saw Hagrid lying on his back , his hands clamped to his nose . 
Grawp , obviously not interested , stood up straight and focused his mind on pulling the knuckles to see how far it turned . 
" It's okay , " said Hagrid harshly as he stood up with one hand clenching his bleeding nose and another picked up his nipple , " Oh , my grandchildren have met him and - and Now it will know when they come back . oh well 
He looked up at Grawp pulling the pine tree with a carefree look on his face like a stone ; The roots rustle when he releases them . 
" Well , I think today is enough , " said Hagrid . " We - well - will we come back later ? " 
Harry and Hermione nodded in agreement . 
Hagrid wore her shoulders on her shoulders and clamped her nose shut , and she returned to the trees . 
Whoever said something for a while , even when they heard the distant sound signal that Grawp still pulls the pine tree toward him . 
Hermione's face was pale and pale . 
Harry could not think of anything to say . 
What happens if someone discovers Hagrid hides Grawp in the Forbidden Forest ? 
And he promised it , Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrid's ineffective efforts to civilize the giant . 
Even with his extraordinary ability to delude himself into the innocent monster that is completely harmless and adorable , how can Uncle Hagrid fool himself into Grawp ? Is it possible to integrate with the human world someday ? 
" Wait a minute , " said Hagrid abruptly , as Harry and Hermione were moving hard through a tree - covered passage behind them . 
She pulled out an arrow from her shoulder bag and put it on . . 
Harry and Hermione were waving their wands ; They have also stopped and can now hear movement very close to it . 
" Oh , " said Hagrid quietly . 
" I thought I told you , Hagrid , " said a lowly male voice , " are you no longer welcome here ? " 
Half of the bare upper body of a man looked like he was drifting toward them in the dim light of blue ; After that , they saw from the lower back was a chestnut horse . 
It has a proud face with high cheekbones and black hair . 
Like Hagrid's uncle , he also carries a weapon ; a bag full of names and a bow with bird feathers on his shoulders . 
" How are you , Magorian ? " Hagrid said cautiously . 
The trees behind the centaur moved and four or five other centaurs appeared behind . 
Harry recognizes that the centaur Bane has a black beard and horse body , the same centaur he met nearly four years ago the night he met Firenze . 
Bane does not show any signs of seeing Harry before . 
" What , " the centaur said with a vicious voice before turning to the Magorian . " I think we agreed on what we would do if he was still in the Forbidden Forest again ? " 
" This person , " I am ? " Uncle Hagrid said irritably . " Just because I prevented you all from murder ? " 
" You should not interfere with our business , Hagrid , " Magorian said . " The way we go is not your path , not your law . 
Firenze betrayed and scammed us . " 
" I do not know where this goes , " said Hagrid impatiently . " He did nothing but help Albus Dumbledore - " 
" Firenze is becoming a slave to man , " said a gray ancestor with a face that had deep , deep wrinkles . 
" Slave ! " Said Hagrid harshly . " What he did to Dumbledore was all ... " 
" He is conveying our knowledge and secrets to humankind , " Magorian said quietly . 
He will not be able to return here with such humiliation . " 
" That's what you said , " shrugged Hagrid , " I personally think you're making a big mistake - " 
" And you , that person , " Bane said , " dared to return to our Forest even when we warned him - " 
" Now listen to me , " said Hagrid furiously . " It's not the Forest of the " brothers , " if you're going to say that . 
You have no right to decide who comes and goes here - " 
" And it also depends on you , Hagrid , " the soft Magorian said . " I let you go today because you go with your young friends ... 
" 
" They are not his friends ! " Bane scornfully interrupted . " They are students , Magorian , from that school ! 
They have acquired the knowledge that the betrayer Firenze got up . " 
" However , " Magorian calmly said , " killing children is a terrible crime - we must not touch innocent innocence . 
Today , Uncle Hagrid , I can go . 
From now on , stay away from this place . 
He lost his friendship with the Centaur when he helped the betrayer Firenze escape from us . " 
" I will not stay away from this place just because of the stingy people like you ! " Said Hagrid loudly . 
" Uncle Hagrid , " said Hermione in a high pitched voice as both Bane and her gray cousin hit the ground , " Come on , Daddy , please , please ! " 
Hagrid moved toward him , but his face was still raised , and his eyes were still staring at the Magorian in a threatening manner . 
" We know what you're holding in the Forbidden Forest , Uncle Hagrid ! " Magorian called after them as the centaurs prepared to disappear . " And our tolerance is about to end ! " 
Hagrid turned around and seemed to be turning back to the Magorian . 
" You will have to endure it as long as it is here , this is its Forest as well as yours ! " He roared as both Harry and Hermione took their best into the leather tunic . The mole is about to force her to go . 
Still angry , he looked down ; his face turned surprised to see both children are trying to push him ; You do not seem to feel it . 
" Calm down , two children , " she said and walked back as both of them gasped behind him . " Damn old mules , huh ? " 
" Uncle Hagrid , " said Hermione breathlessly as they yelled in the path of the goat that their friend had gone to before , " if the centaurs do not want people in the Forbidden Forest , I'm afraid of you and Hary can not - " 
" Well , you heard them , " said Hagrid gruffly . " They will not touch the horses - you mean the kids . 
Anyway , we can not let them push us away . " 
" Very good , " Harry muttered to Hermione , looking so teary . 
Finally , they set foot back on the big road , and after ten minutes the trees became thin ; They can see the blue sky and far away the sound of shouting shouting . 
" Did you add more points ? " Asked Hagrid , stopping under the trees as the Quidditch field appeared in sight . " or is the game over ? " 
" I do not know , " said Hermione distressed . 
Harry saw how she looked so pathetic ; Her hair was full of young branches and leaves , her tunic was torn several places and there were countless scratches on her face and arms . 
Harry knew it looked a little better . 
" I think the game is over ! " Said Hagrid , still looking at the stadium . " Look - everyone is coming out - if you guys hurry up a little you can go into the crowd and no one will know you are not in the stadium ! " 
" That's good , " said Harry . " See you later , Hagrid . " 
" I do not believe him , " said Hermione in an indecisive voice as they just came out of Hagrid's . 
" I do not believe him . 
I really do not trust him . " 
" Calm down , " said Harry . 
" Calm down ! " The girl hastily shouted . " A giant ! 
A giant in the Forbidden Forest ! 
And we are asked to teach him English ! 
Of course , with the assumption that we can get past that murderous centenary ! 
I - not - believe - think - he - he ! " 
" We can not do anything else ! " Harry tried to convince her friend in a quiet voice as they entered the crowd of Hufflepuffs in the direction of the castle . " He never asked us to do anything unless he was fired , that would not have happened . " 
" Oh , you left that tone , Harry ! " Hermione said angrily , standing to the rear of the crowd forced to divert to avoid . " Of course he will be kicked out and honestly , after what we see , who can blame Umbridge ? " 
There was a moment of silence as Harry stared at the little girl , tears streaming slowly into her eyes . 
" You're not going to say that , " said Harry quietly . 
" No , I'm not going to say that , " she said and wiped her eyes angrily . " But why did he make his life so hard - for us too ? " 
" I do not know - " 
" Weasley is our King , Weasley is King of us , He does not leave a Quaffle on any limb , Weasley is king of us . " 
" And I wish they'd stop that silly song , " Hermione said , " Are not they gloating enough ? " 
A huge wave of students are moving from the pitch to the rug . 
" Oh , let's go inside if we do not want to see the Slytherins , " said Hermione . 
" Weasley can save any limbs , he never leaves a ring , that's why . 
The Gryffindors we sing : Weasley is the king of these guys . " 
" Hermione " Harry slowly said . 
The song became bigger , but it came out not from the Slytherins in blue - white , but from the red and yellow crowd moving slowly towards the castle , lifting on one shoulder . body . 
" Weasley is our king , Weasley is our king , he does not fall for a Quaffle on any limb , Weasley is the king of us . " 
" No ? " Hermione said in a compressed voice . 
" Yes ! " Said Harry loudly . 
" HARRY ! 
HERMIONE ! " Ron shouted , holding the silver Quidditch trophy up and looking to the side . " We've done it ! 
We won ! " 
They laughed at him when he was passing by . 
There was a clutter at Ron's castle door and head , and it hit the door , but no one seemed to want to lower it . 
Still singing , the crowd crowded through the entrance to the Hall and the room . 
Harry and Hermione looked at the crowd happily , until the last echoes of the sentence " Weasley was King of us " turned off . 
Then they turned to look at each other , the smile fading away . 
" We should keep this until tomorrow morning , okay ? " Said Harry . 
" Yes , " said Hermione tiredly . " I'm not in a hurry either . " 
Together they climbed up the steps . 
At the front door , both of them instinctively turn to look at the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry was not sure if it was imagined by him , but he thought it looked like he saw a bunch of birds flying from the distant trees , as if the tree they were nesting . Both roots are uprooted . 
Chapter 31 
Ron's excitement as he helped the Gryffindors raise the Quiddicth trophy that made it impossible for the next day to focus on anything . 
All he wanted was to talk about the match , so Harry and Hermione found it difficult to start telling him about Grawp . 
Both of them tried their best , but they all failed to bring Ron back to reality when he was mad at winning . 
It was a beautiful and warm day , they persuaded Ron to join in to review under the shade of an oak tree at the corner of the lake , where they were less likely to be eavesdropped than in the common room . 
Ron first did not accept that idea - he was enjoying the whole of being patronized by any Gryffindor student who passed by his throne , regardless of whether it always coughed in the ear . The word " Weasley is our king " often - But in the end it agrees that a little fresh air is good for it . 
They spread out their books under the shade of an oak tree and sat down when Ron was still intoxicated dozens of times about his first rescue in the game . 
' Oh , I want to say , I've tried to save Davies ' last save , but I'm not confident , but I know when Bradley came in front of me , just in time , thought - - You can do that - - - ! 
And I thought it took a second to decide what direction to fly , you know , because it seems to be looking at the right side of the subject - to his right , obviously , to his side - But I leaped at the funny idea that it was lurking , then I got the chance and flew to the left , I wanted to say - and - oh - you saw what was going on , It ends abruptly , and at the same time it is superficially reddened and as if the closest one is glancing toward it . - - A group of Hufflepuffs in the third year - - - heard that story . ' And then , when Chambers came to his place about five minutes later - What is this ? ' Ron asked , interrupting his sentence as he dug into Harry's face . ' Why are you laughing ? ' 
' I do not have a laugh , ' Harry said quickly , and stared down at the Dispenser notebook , trying to make his face a bit more serious . 
The fact is that Ron has been reminiscent of Harry in a Gryffindor who once had his hair cut under the tree . ' I'm just glad we won , that's all . ' 
' Okay , ' Ron said slowly , enjoying the words , ' We won . 
Did you see Chang's face when Ginny caught the ball right in front of his nose ? ' 
' I thought he was crying , right ? " Said Harry bitterly . 
' Yes , it's more angry than ever , right ... ' Ron made a sad expression . ' But you saw it throw its broom off the back of the field , did not you ? ' 
' Oh ... " said Harry . 
' Hey , well , no , Ron , ' said Hermione , with a heavy sigh , putting the book down and looking at Ron as much as she could . " The truth is , Harry and I just watched a match as Davies scored the first goal . " 
Ron's messy hair seemed to fall off in frustration . ' Did not you watch ? " He said languidly , looking down at one to another . ' You have not looked back to save one team at home ? ' 
' Ờ ... 
No , ' said Hermione , putting her arms around Ron to soften it . ' But Ron , we do not want to go - ' ' We were forced to do that ! ' 
' Ờ ? " Said Ron , his face was reddish like gut ' What about that ? ' 
' That's hagrid , ' said Harry . ' He was going to reveal to us how Uncle Ho was so wounded when he came back from the giants . 
Uncle wants us to go into the forest with Uncle , we have no other choice , you know how he will . 
Anyway ... ' 
The story is told in five minutes , in the end , Ron's anger was replaced by a look of complete skepticism . 
' You brought a man back and hid it in the forest ? ' 
' yes ' Harry was resolute . 
' I can not , ' said Ron , as if to say that the story would turn into a lie . ' No , he can not do that . ' 
' Oh , he did that , ' said Hermione gingerly . ' Grawp is 16 feet tall , ripped off twenty feet of wood , and knows you , ' she smirked . ' Under Hermy ' 
Ron smiled nervously . 
' And Uncle Hagrid wants us .... To ' 
Teach English pictures , right . ' Said Harry 
' You're crazy , ' Ron said in a frightened voice . 
' Ừ ' Hermione hissed , flipped through the Intermediate page and looked at a series of diagrams on how to turn a donkey into a pair of Opera glasses . ' Oh , I also think you look like that . 
But , unfortunately , he forced himself and Harry to promise ' 
' Oh , then you just have to break the promise , ' Ron said firmly . ' I mean , let's see ... we have to do the test and we're going to - ' " - Raise your hand to show that your fingers are almost touching each other ' - - - get involved in a lot of trouble in this one . 
And ... Miss Norbert ? 
Remember the spider aragog it ? Have we ever had a good time meeting Hagrid's friends ? ' 
" I understand , but - " " We promised , " said Hermione . 
Ron clawed his hair again , looking worried . 
' Well , ' he sighed , ' but Hagrid has not been fired , is he ? 
You will be challenged for a long time , maybe he will be challenged until the end of this semester and we will not have to approach Grawp at that time ' 
* 
The ground of the castle is shining as it has just been repainted , The sky is no cloud like laughing to yourself in the sparkling lake , the lawns often move when the wind blows lightly . . 
June is coming , but for fifth - year students it just means : Graduation Certificate of Common Magic has finally arrived . 
The teachers of the bugs do not pass the homework again , the lessons are devoted to reviewing the knowledge that the professors believe will be given in the test . 
Intentionally , the pressure of fatigue is everywhere , but not OWL contests from Harry's mind . 
However , he had several times wondered in the poison hour that Lupine had told Snape about making him continue teaching the Occlumency to Harry . 
If he had asked , Snape would have completely ignored Lupine's words as he ignored Harry . 
This matched Harry's current situation , he was too busy and anxious though he did not have time to study with Snape , and to relieve him of it , Hermione haunted it all through the day . It's about Reed , who spent most of his time nagging for himself , and unfortunately for another elf for several days . 
She is not the only one who behaves abnormally when the exams come on . 
Ernie Macmillan has a habit of hurting people by questioning their habit of reviewing it . 
' How much time do you think to work ? ' He asked Harry and Ron how hard they were lining up outside of botany , with a faint light in his eyes . 
' I do not know ' Ron said ' A few hours ' 
' More or less than eight hours ? ' 
' Less , guess , ' said Ron , looking a bit worried . 
' I did exactly eight hours , ' Ernie said , patting her chest . ' Nine or eight . 
I learn an hour before breakfast every day . 
Eight hours is the average time . 
I can study ten hours in a good weekend . 
I studied for nine and a half hours on Monday . 
Tuesday is not so - only seven and a half hours . 
Then the fourth day ... ' 
Harry was grateful that Professor Sprout had led them to the botanist at the time , and took Ernie out of his mind . 
Meanwhile , Draco Mlàoy has found another way to bring panic . 
' Of course , that's not what you know . ' He heard Mloa say he's with Crabble and Goyle out there . 
At that time , my dad had been in intimate relations with the Medical Examination Committee for many years . - - - Griselda Marchbanks old - - - We stayed at home for dinner and did everything . ' 
' Do you think it's real ? " Hermione asked nervously for Harry and Ron . 
" We can not do anything if it's true , " Ron murmured . 
' I do not think he's telling the truth . ' Neville said softly to them . ' Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my grandparents , and she has never mentioned Mlàoys . ' 
' How is she , Nellville ? ' Hermione asked immediately , ' Is she strict ? ' 
' Just like my grandparents , it's true , ' Neville said quietly . 
' You know that she will not touch your chances , right ? ' Ron encourages Nelville . 
" Well , I do not think there will be any incentives , " Neville said , sounding miserable . " My grandparents say Professor Marchbanks is not as good as his parents . 
Hmm ... how do you see my grandmother's disease ? ' 
Neville glared at the ceiling . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione glanced at each other , but they did not know what to say . It was Neville's first mention of meeting them at the Magical Hospital . 
In the meantime , a group of traders focused on the black market , an agility and vigilance emerged in the fifth and seventh years . 
Harry and Ron were seduced by Baruffo's bottle containing Baruffio's brain when Eddie Carmichael introduced him to the sixth year of the Ravenclaw , who swore that the drug had helped him reach the " Premiership " of the season . OWL contest last year and only delivered to twelve Galleons for half a liter . 
Ron assured her that he would repay the money immediately when he graduated and found a job , but before they agreed , Hermione took the vial from Carmichael and poured it on the toilet . 
' Hermione , we want to buy that drug ! ' Shouted Ron . 
' Do not be fooled , ' said Hermione . ' You would rather buy Harold's dragon's talon powder than that . ' 
' Powdered from the valley dragon claw ? ' Asked Ron eagerly . 
' But nothing . ' Hermione said , ' I'm also recording . 
None of these things really work , you know . ' 
' Nails are effective ! " I think the effect will be unbelievable , " Ron said . " It really stimulates the brain , you're going to be smart in the next few hours . " Hermione , giving me a handful , she was not bothered . ... ' 
' This nonsense can be true , ' said Hermione . ' I've researched it , and it's really a pinch of pain - dry - up ! ' 
This information lost all Ron and Harry's craving for brain - stimulating drugs . 
They received the exam schedule and the OWL exam process in the next class . 
' You see it . ' " Professor McGonagall said to the class as they copied the date and time of the exams on the board , " The baby's OWL exams will last for two busy weeks . 
You will take the morning exam and practice in the afternoon . 
The practice of astronomy is also , of course , taking place in the evening . ' 
' Now , we must warn you that the most rigorous Anti - Fraud Charms will also be put into your test papers . 
Self - answer rolls will also be banned from the corridor , as well as Remembrance , and Revolver , as well as Manual Correction . 
Each year , it is regrettable to say , it seems that at least one contestant thought he would pass the rules of the Examination Committee . 
I just hope it's not Gryffindor's . 
The new principal - ' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with a face like Petunia's face when she saw a stubborn stain , ' - told the manager of each house to tell students . Their belief that cheating will be punished the most severely , because , of course , your results will show how the new Principal of our school - 
Professor McGonagall sighs slightly ; Harry saw her spike bulge . 
' However , there is no reason for you not to do your best . 
You have your own future to think about . ' 
Professor , ' said Hermione , her arm up in the air , ' when can we know the results of the test ? ' 
' An owl will send it to you sometime in July . Said Professor McGonagall . 
Great , ' Dean Thomas said in a whisper , ' so we do not have to worry about it until the end of the holiday . ' 
Harry imagined it sitting on his bed at Privet Drive for six weeks , waiting for his OWL results . 
Well , he thought it was unlikely he would at least be sure about a piece of the summer . 
The first test of the kids , The Theory of Charms , was scheduled on Monday morning . 
Harry agreed to check Hermione after lunch on Sunday , but regretted almost immediately ; She was very agitated and often grabbed the book from her hand to see if she had the right answer , finally banging her nose very hard with the sharp accent of The Achievements of Charms . 
' Why do not you do this yourself ? ' He said decisively , giving the book to the girl , full of tears . 
In the meantime , Ron was reading a number of Twilight verses with fingers covering his ears , his lips quivering ; Seamus Finnigan is lying flat on the floor , recounting the actual Talisman while Dean is examining it in the Charmed Textbook , Level 5 ; and Parvati and Lavender , who are practicing the Elemental Movement Talismans , make their pen boxes run around the edge of the table . 
Dinner was a pleasant work that night . 
Harry and Ron did not say much , but had eaten with a cheer , had exhausted all day studying . 
Hermione , on the other hand , frequently puts her knife and fork down , and bends down under the table to get her bag , so she can take out a book to check out a few things and numbers . 
Ron told her she had to have a proper meal or she would not be able to sleep that night , as her plate fell from her soft fingers on her plate with a very tinkling sound . to . 
' Oh , my God , ' she said softly , staring at the Hall of Fame . ' Are they not ? are the examers right ? ' 
Harry and Ron spun around on their bench . 
Through the door of the Great Hall they can see Umbridge standing with a group of elderly witches . 
Umbridge , Harry was very pleased to see , looking worried . 
' We will go there and look more carefully ? ' Said Ron . 
Harry and Hermione nodded and rushed to the double door leading into the Outer Room , slowing as they stepped through the threshold to walk calmly through the examiners . 
Harry thought that Professor Marchbanks had to be a little witch and hunched back with such a wrinkled look that it looked like it was covered with spider webs ; Umbridge is talking to her very respectfully . 
Professor Marchbanks seems a bit deaf ; She was answering Professor Umbridge so loudly that in reality they were only standing one foot apart . 
' The trip was very good , the trip was very good , we went so many times before ! She said impatiently . ' At this point , I did not hear about Dumbledore recently ! " She added , looking around the Hall seemed very hopeful that he might suddenly appear from a broomstick . ' There is no information about him , I suppose ? ' 
' Not at all , ' said Umbridge , throwing a vicious look at Harry , Ron and Hermione fumbling around the foot of the stairs as Ron forged his shoelaces . ' But I dare say that the Ministry of Magic will catch him as quickly as possible . ' 
' I doubt that , ' smiled Marckbanks , ' if Dumbledore does not want to be spotted ! ' 
I know ... personally tested him for the Transformers and Charms when he took NEWT ... doing everything with the wand I had not seen before . ' 
' Yes ​​ ... 
Um ... Professor Umbridge said when Harry , Ron and Hermione trudged up the marble staircase as slowly as possible , ' let me show you the teacher's room . 
I dare say she would want a separation after her trip . ' 
It was a pleasant evening . 
People are trying to review the last minute but no one seems to be better off . 
Harry goes to bed early , but then lies awake for hours . 
He recalled his occupational references and McGonagall's angry statement that she helped her become a goddess if it was her last thing to do . 
He wished that it had expressed a wish that could have been fulfilled at the time of the examination . 
He knew that he was not the only one who was awake , but none of the rest in the bedroom spoke and finally , in turn , fell asleep . 
No fifth - grader spoke much of the next morning : Parvati was practicing the mantra under her breath as the salt cork in front of her jerked up , and Hermione was rereading the Accomplishments . The charm is so fast that her eyes become dim ; and Neville regularly drops his knife and fork and knocks on the orange jam . 
By the time breakfast passes , the fifth and seventh year students gather around the Great Hall while the other students leave for the classrooms ; Then , at nine and a half , they were called back from layer to layer in the Great Hall , rearranged exactly as Harry had seen in Judgment when his father , Sirius and Snape OWL exam ; The four tables were removed and replaced by many tables , all pointing towards the teacher's desk at the end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall faced the children . 
When they all sat down and silent , she said , ' You can start , ' and overturned the giant timepiece on the table behind her , where there were plenty of red ink , ink and rolls of parchment on it . 
Harry opened his paper , his heart pounding - three rows to the right and four seats to the front , Hermione began to write in a hurry - and lowered his eyes to the first question : a ) mantra and b ) describe the movement of the wand needed to make things fly . 
Harry had a quick memory of a baton soaring high up in the air and landing very hard on the big head of a giant ... with a laugh , he turned back to the paper and began to write . 
* 
' Well , it's not too bad , is it ? " Hermione said nervously in the Hall . ' I'm not sure that I have used all my knowledge of the Hung Chanh Hung , I was short of hours . 
Do you have extra curses for hiccups ? 
I did not write in , sure I should write in , it is too similar - and to the question twenty - three - 
' Hermione , ' said Ron firmly , ' we've been through this situation ... we can not do all the tests again , doing it once was bad enough . ' 
Fifth students eat lunch together with the rest of the school ( four tables come back for lunch ) , then gather in a small room next to the Great Hall , where they wait . Call to practice . 
Whenever a small group of students were called in alphabet , the rest whispered the mantras and practiced wandering , occasionally poking their backs or eyes in error . 
Hermione's name is called . 
Run run , she left the room with Anthony Goldstein , Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass . 
The students who were checked did not come back , so Harry and Ron did not know what Hermione did . 
Will she be fine , remember that she has one hundred and twelve percent for each Chance ? ' Said Ron . 
Ten minutes later , Professor Flitwick called , ' Parkinson , Pansy - Patil , Padma - Patil , Parvati - Potter , Harry . ' ( Call them first , the following - ND ) 
' Good luck , ' said Ron softly . 
Harry entered the Great Hall , grabbed his wand , and shook hands . 
Professor Tofty is at rest , Potter , ' Professor Flitwick squealed , right in the door . 
He pointed to someone like the oldest and most baldest examiner sitting behind a small desk at a far corner , a short distance from Professor Marchbanks , who was checking out Draco Malfoy in half . 
' Potter was right , ' said Professor Tofty , examining the note of the umbrella _ looking at Harry through the glass - clip - nose when he asked , ' Potter is famous ? ' 
Through his eyes , Harry clearly saw Malfoy throw a look of contempt at him ; The glass of wine that Malfoy soared had fallen to the floor and shattered . 
Harry could not hold back a smile ; Professor Tofty smiled back encouragingly . 
' That , ' he said in his trembling old voice , ' need not worry . 
Now , if you can tell me to take this egg cup and make it spin like a snack for me . ' 
In general , Harry thought that everything was going well . 
Its Moving Spree is certainly much better than Malfoy , though it wished that it had not mistaken the Color Change mantle with the Great Charm , so that the mouse that it had changed to orange bulged out . badly and the size of a badger before Harry had 
Can fix his error . ( I do not know what a pup is ... 
It was very glad that Hermione was not in the Hall at the time and ignored the mention of this to her . 
He could tell Ron , though ; Ron made a dinner plate that turned into a big mushroom that did not understand why it happened . 
There is no time to rest that night ; They went straight to the common room after dinner and rehearsed for the next day on their own ; Harry went to bed with his head in his head and mingled his mantra . 
He forgot about the definition of transformation mantra in the writing test the next morning but thought the practice would be much worse . 
At the very least , it can make the whole of its iguanas disappear , while poor Hannah Abbott completely loses her head at the next table and by one In some way , the flamingos of the little girl flocked to the flamingos , causing the bird to stop for ten minutes before the birds were taken and taken out of the Great Hall . 
The children had a herbal quiz on Wednesday ( except for a small bite of a Rhinoceros , and Harry felt it doing a good job ) ; and then , on Thursday , the Dark Arts Defense . 
At this time , for the first time , Harry felt confident that it would pass . 
It does not have a problem with writing questions and there is a particular comfort , during the practice test , during the presentation of the merits and the protective mantras in front of Umbridge , Closely close from the doors leading into the Great Hall . 
' Oh , great ! Professor Tofty , again examining Harry , exclaimed , as Harry made a mockery of chasing Mr. Perfect . ' Very good ! 
Um , I think that's enough , Potter ... unless ... ' 
He leaned forward a little . 
' I heard , from my good friend Tiberius Ogden , that you could make a Patronus ? 
Come on , a bonus ... ? ' 
Harry lifted his wand , looked directly at Umbridge , and imagined that she was fired . 
Expecto patronum ! ' 
A silver deer comes out from his wand and walks along the length of the Hall . 
All the examiners looked at it and when it melted into silver fog , Professor Tofty fluttered his bony hand energetically . 
' Wonderful ! He said . 
' Very good , Potter , you can go ! ' 
When Harry walks past Umbridge by the door , their eyes meet . 
There was a dirty smile on her wide , sluggish mouth , but she did not care . 
Unless it has too many bugs ( and it's not intended to tell anyone , in case it does ) it has won a ' Featured ' OWL exam . ( Featured is a scale - ND ) 
On Friday , Harry and Ron had a busy day while Hermione was playing the Old Testament , and when they had the entire weekend off , they had allowed themselves a vacation without a review . 
They stretched their shoulders and yawned by the open windows , the summer warmth being subdued as they played the witch's flag . 
Harry could see Hagrid in the distance , teaching a class at the edge of the forest . 
He was trying to see which creature was being examined - he thought it might have been unicorns , because the boys seemed to back out a bit - when the portrait opened and Hermione climbed in . , looks totally frustrating . 
' What is the Old Testament ? " Asked Ron , yawning and stretching . 
' I did the wrong translation from ehwaz , ' said Hermione furiously . ' It means collaboration , not protection ; I have mistakenly come from eihwaz . ' 
' Well , well , ' said Ron lazily , ' that's the only fault , will you still have ... ' 
' Oh , do not say it ! ' Hermione was angry . ' That would be the only fault that made the difference between landing and sliding . 
And then , somebody put a mine in the Umbridge office . 
I do not know how they could break through that new door , but I just passed by and Umbridge was screaming - with that sound , she was trying to take a pass from her leg - 
' Good , ' said Harry and Ron in unison . 
' This is not good at all ! ' Hermione was hot . " She thinks Hagrid does that , remember ? 
And we do not want Uncle Hagrid to be fired ! ' 
' She is teaching at this time , she can not blame him , ' said Harry , gesturing toward the window . 
' Oh , you're so naive sometimes , Harry . 
Do you really think Umbridge will wait for the evidence ? " Hermione said , obviously in extreme anger , and she turned to the girls bedroom , slamming the door behind her . 
' What a lovely character girl , ' said Ron gently , pushing his men to attack Harry's knight . 
Hermione's bad mood lasted for most of the weekend , though Harry and Ron found it easy to ignore it because they spent most of Saturday and Sunday to review the toxic lesson . Pharmacy for Monday's exam , the exam that Harry looks at least - and the exam that he is sure will dissipate his dream of becoming a god . 
Undoubtedly , it is difficult to find the test , although it thinks it can get the maximum score for the polyjuice potion ; It accurately describes the effects of the potion because it made it secret in the second year . 
Afternoon practice is not as scary as it may seem . 
In the presence of Master Snape , he found it far more comfortable than usual during the preparation . 
Neville , sitting very close to Harry , also seemed happier than when Harry often saw it in the reading room 
Pharmacy . 
When Professor Marchbanks said , ' Please stay out of your cauldron , the exam time is over , ' Harry closed the lid of his medicine pot and felt that it was not going to get good marks . Luckily , it can avoid slipping . 
' There are only four , ' said Parvati Patil , exhausted as they walked into Gryffindor's common room . 
' Only four ! " Hermione said irritably . ' I have arithmetic , that's definitely the most bone ! ' 
No one was so stupid as to say that , so she had no place to vent her anger and satisfied with scolding the first year students for laughing so loudly in the common room . 
Harry is determined to perform very well the Mystery Care Cure on Tuesday so that Hagrid will not lose face . 
The practice was conducted that afternoon on a lawn adjacent to the Forbidden Forest where students were asked to identify exactly the Knarl hiding in a dozen or so hedgehogs . They drink milk : the knarls are very skeptical creatures and their feathers have a lot of magical properties , which in general are angry with what it regards as an attempt to poison it . The then show how to treat a Bowtruckle ; Feed and sanitize a Fire Crab without making yourself burned ; and choose from a range of diet foods for a sick unicorn . 
Harry could see Hagrid watching nervously from his hut window . 
When the person examining Harry , this time a small and grumpy little witch smiles at him and says he can go , Harry puts his finger up against Hagrid before heading back to the castle . 
The test of the theory of astronomy on Wednesday morning is not so bad . 
Harry is not confident it has filled in the names of the moons of Jupiter , but at least it certainly does not confuse them with a mouse . 
They have to wait until the evening to do the Astronomy Exercise ; Instead they took the Prophet's afternoon . 
Even though Harry set the criteria for the Prophet very low , his test was bad . 
It tried very hard to see the sky - moving images as well as the stiff - glass spheres ; He plugs his neck plug into reading the tea leaves , saying that Marchbanks seems to be confronting a strange , wet , black and rounded object , completing his failure by confusing sugar . pointing the hand and the mainstream in the palm of her hand , informing her that she should have died on Tuesday . 
' We went to skip this one , ' said Ron gaily as they climbed the stone stairs . 
It made Harry feel more comfortable telling him what he said to his testimony about an ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball , and only when he looked up . I realized it was depicting the reflection image of the tester . 
' From the beginning , we should not choose this stupid subject , ' said Harry . 
' It's not too late , at least we can give it up now . ' 
' That's right , ' said Harry . ' We would not have to pretend we were interested in what would happen if Jupiter and Uranus came so close together . ' 
' And from now on , I would not care if the tea leaves signal death , Ron , is going to die - I just throw them in the garbage can . ' 
Harry laughed as Hermione ran after them . 
It stopped laughing right away when it bothered her . 
' I think I did pretty good arithmetic , ' she said , and both Harry and Ron were relieved . ' Let's have a look at the little boat before dinner ' 
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at 11 o ' clock , they found it an ideal night to observe the stars , not a cloud and very quiet . 
The ground bathed in silver moonlight and the air was slightly cold . 
They divided the telescopes and when Professor Marchbanks allowed , began filling in the empty star map that they had just received . 
Professor Marchbanks and Tofty went back and forth between them , tracking them accurately filling the positions of the stars and planets they observed . 
All quiet except for the clipping of parchments , the occasional sound of a telescope when the student adjusts its position on the shelf , and the scraping of the scissors . 
An hour and a half passed , then an hour later ; The flashing yellow light areas on the ground below begin to disappear as the light from the castle windows shuts off . 
However , when Harry completes filling the constellation Orion into its map , the door in front of the castle opens beneath the rail where it is standing , making the light filled with stone steps and paths . out of the lawn . 
Harry glanced down as he adjusted a bit of the telescope's position and saw five or six people stretching across the grass that was lit before the door closed and the lawn was flooded . in the dark . 
Harry turned his eyes back to the telescope and focused again on that Venus star . 
He looked down at the map and filled it in , but something caught his attention ; stopping the pen hanging above the parchment , he glanced down at the dark ground beneath it and saw six shadows crossing the grass . 
If they do not move and the moonlight does not shine directly at them , they are completely in the dark . 
Even at this distance , Harry had the odd feeling that he recognized the tide of a dwarf shadow of them , who seemed to be leading the group . 
She could not think why Umbridge would want to go out for a walk after midnight like this with five others . 
Someone coughs behind it , and it remembers that it did half the test . 
It completely forgot about Venus . 
Sticking out the telescope , it finds and again prepares to fill the map , ready to catch a strange sound when it hears a knock knocked far away on the ground . Feed the people below , then the loud barking dog like crazy . 
He looked up , his heart pounding . 
There was light on Hagrid's hut window and the man he watched crossed the grass that was now shining on the window . 
The door opened and it clearly saw six people crossing the threshold . 
The door closed and the house fell silent . 
Harry felt disturbed . 
He glances at Ron or Hermione for a moment , but Professor Marchbanks comes after him right away , and since he does not want to look like he's watching over anyone , Harry hurries . bent over its star map and pretended to be adding notes while actually observing from the edge of the railing toward Hagrid's hut . 
Shadows are now moving through the hut window , blocking the light . 
He could feel Professor Marchbanks ' eyes pointing at the back of his neck and force it to turn his eyes back to the telescope , staring at the moon that had been marking the place for an hour or two ago . But as soon as Professor Marchbanks turned to the other he heard a loud roar from the hut through the screen at the top of the Astronomy Tower . 
Some of the students around them left the telescope and started looking toward Hagrid's hut . 
Professor Tofty coughed dryly . 
' Try and focus on , the games , ' he said quietly . 
Most students return to the telescope . 
Harry looked to the left . 
Hermione was staring at Hagrid's tent . 
" Eh ? " " Twenty minutes , " Professor Tofty said . 
Hermione jerked her head and turned back to the star map ; Harry looked down at his map and noticed that it had misplaced Mars for Venus . 
He bent down to fix it . 
Try a big sound from the ground . 
Someone shouted ' Oh ! ' as they poke their faces with the tail of the telescope because they want to protrude to see what's going on underneath . 
Hagrid's hut door widened and , with the light shining from inside the hut , they saw clearly the huge shadow of his uncle screaming and raising his fist , he was surrounded by six people , They all seemed to be trying to stun Uncle , if they look at the red light they swung toward Hagrid . 
' Are not ! ' Cried Hermione . 
' The games ! Professor Tofty said with a wry voice . This is the hour to check that ! ' 
But no one is paying attention to their star map . 
The bright red beams were still flying from Hagrid's hut , and it seemed they were coming out of him ; He was still standing upright and still fighting if Harry saw it . 
The screams resounded throughout the earth ; a man shouted , ' Know what , Hagrid ! ' 
Hagrid growled , ' Know that damn thing , you will not be able to catch me ! ' 
Harry could see the tiny shape of Fang trying to protect him , he constantly rushed to the witches around him until the Blight had hit him and he fell to the ground . 
Hagrid hissed a fury , lifted the culprit off the ground and threw him away ; The man flew 10 feet away and could not get up . 
Hermione gasped , her hands held up and gagged ; Harry looked at Ron and found him scared . 
None of them ever saw Hagrid in that state before . 
' Look ! " Parvati cried out , leaning against the rail and pointing towards the foot of the castle , where the front door opened again ; with more light spewing out the dark patch of grass and a long dark shadow running across the lawn . 
' Now ! Professor Tofty said anxiously . ' only 16 minutes left ! ' 
But no one paid attention to his words : they were watching the man who was running toward the match next to Hagrid's hut . 
' How dare you ! ' the people shouted while running . ' How dare you ! ' 
' That's Miss McGonagall ! Hermione whispered . 
' Let him alone ! ! Professor McGonagall's voice rises from the darkness . ' What the devil made you attack him ? 
He did not do anything , no arrest warrant - ' 
Hermione , Parvati and Lavender exclaimed . 
The shadows surrounding the hut shuffled at least four Stunning Blessings into Professor McGonagall . 
Just halfway from the castle to the hut , the red light touched her ; For a moment , she looked glowing and flushed in an abnormal red light , then fell backward and did not budge . 
' Galloping gargoyles ! Professor Tofty yelled , as he seemed to have completely forgot to turn the test . ' No notice ! 
What a despicable act ! ' 
' HOW TO DRAW ! Uncle Hagrid growled ; The sound reached the top of the tower , and some of the lights flashed inside the castle . ' OVERLOOKING FOR SALE ! PLEASE RECEIVE THIS - AND HAPPY - ' 
" Oh - " Hermione gasped . 
Hagrid punched the nearest two attackers ; If they look at the way they poured down immediately they seem to have been knocked down . 
Harry saw Hagrid collapse and he thought he had finally been hit by a curse . 
By contrast , Hagrid immediately stood up straight with something that looked like a sack on his back - Harry realized it was Fang's soft body lying across his shoulder . 
' Get him ! Mrs. Umbridge shouted , but her other helpers seemed reluctant to step into Hagrid's range of fists , and he slipped back so fast , stumbling over an unconscious man and falling . out . 
Hagrid turned and began to run with Fang still lying across his neck . 
Mrs. Umbridge threw a cunning words but slipped ; and Uncle Hagrid ran like crazy to the far barrier , disappeared into the darkness . 
There was a moment of trembling in silence as everyone stared down the aisle . 
Then Professor Tofty's voice was feeble , ' Hm , five minutes , all the games . ' 
Although it had only filled in two - thirds of its map , Harry was desperate for the test to end . 
When it finally ended , he , Ron and Hermione slammed the telescopes back into the rack and climbed down the rim of the spiral staircase . 
No student wants to go to bed ; They chatted loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had just witnessed . 
' Bad woman ! ' Hermione gasped , and she seemed to have a hard time controlling her anger . 
Try to attack Hagrid in the dark ! ' 
' She obviously wanted to avoid a scene similar to that of Valerie's , ' Ernie Macmillan said coyly as he joined them . 
' Hagrid was very good , was not he ? " Said Ron , looking more frightened than impressed . ' How did the curses not work for him ? ' 
' That's because of his bloody blood , ' said Hermione shakily . ' It was very hard to dazzle a giant , they were very strong , but Professor McGonagall had four stunned curses that struck her chest and she was not young anymore , right ? ' 
' It's disgusting , ' said Ernie , while shaking her head in a swagger . ' Let's go to sleep . 
Good night . ' 
The students around them scurried away while still screaming enthusiastically about what they had just seen . 
At least they could not bring him to Azkaban , ' said Ron . " I think he ' ll go to Dumbledore , right ? ' 
' I think so too , ' said Hermione , her eyes filled with tears . ' What a pity , I really think Dumbledore will be back soon , but now we have lost Hagrid . ' 
They wandered to Gryffindor's common room and found it filled with people . 
This disturbance has awakened some people , who rush to wake up his friend . 
Seamus and Dean , just in front of Harry , Ron and Hermione , are now telling everyone what they have seen from the top of the Tower of Heaven . 
' But why break out Hagrid ? Angelina Johnson asked while shaking her head . ' Not like Miss Trelawney ; he is getting up well this school year ! ' 
' Umbridge hated people of human blood , ' said Hermione bitterly , and dropped herself into the armchair . " She always tried to cure Hagrid . ' 
' And she thought it was Hagrid himself who dropped the Peaches into her office , ' hissed Katie Bell . 
' Oh , my God , ' said Lee Jordan , raising his arms . ' I've dropped my miners into her office . 
Fred and George left him a pair ; I dropped them flying into her window . ' 
' Anyway , I ' ll get rid of him , too , ' Dean said . ' He was so close to Dumbledore . ' 
' That's right , ' said Harry , as he dropped into an armchair next to Hermione . 
" I just hope Professor McGonagall will be okay , " Lavender said with tears . 
' They brought her back to the castle , we saw through the bedroom window , ' Colin Creevey said . ' She did not look so good . ' 
' Mrs. Pomfrey will heal her , ' said Alicia Spinnet . ' She has never failed smoothly . ' 
It was almost four o ' clock in the morning when the living room was full of people . 
Harry felt asleep ; Hagrid's image runs like mad at the darkness haunting it ; She felt so angry at Umbridge that she could not think of any punishments bad enough for her , though Ron's suggestion that she swallowed a box of Blast - Ended Skrewts seemed to be heard . . 
She fell asleep while still calculating the terrible revenge measures and when she awoke three hours later , she felt no rest . 
The final test is History of Magecraft that will take place that afternoon . 
Harry had wanted to go back to bed after breakfast , but he had to take advantage of the rest of the morning to review the post at the moment of the meeting , so he sat at the window of the common room , trying hard not to fall asleep while scrolling through the three - and - a - half - pound stack that Hermione had lent him . 
Fifth - graders entered the Hall at two o ' clock and sat down in their seats , in front of them , examining their face down . 
Harry felt exhausted . 
It 
Just want this exam fast end , so that it can go to sleep ; Then tomorrow , he and Ron will go out to the Quidditch Arena - it will fly with Ron's broom - and enjoy the freedom of reviewing . 
' Turn it up , ' said Professor Marchbanks , as she stood in front of them in the Hall , turning over the huge sand clock . ' You can start the lesson . ' 
Harry stared as nailed to the first question . 
It took him a few seconds to realize that he could not read a word in it ; There is an awkward buzz through one of the overhead windows . 
Slowly , sluggishly , it finally began to write the answer . 
He found it difficult to remember the names and not to confuse the date . 
It quits right away in question four . ( In your view , the wand law has contributed better or worse to the control of 18 th century goblin revolts ? ) , It thinks it will spin . Come back to this question at the end of the hour . 
He did the fifth question ( how was the Privacy Act violated in 1749 and what measures were taken to prevent recidivism ? ) But it suspected it had ignored some important points ; It feels like somewhere in the story must have the appearance of the vampire . 
It tries to find a question that it can answer correctly and its eyes stop at number ten : Describe the circumstances leading up to the formation of the International Wizarding Federation and explain why the master Liechtenstein's witches refuse to participate . 
I know this , Harry thought , though his mind felt cramped and absent . 
It can be seen a title , with Hermione's handwriting : to establish the International Federation of Wraiths it reads this morning . 
He began to write , sometimes looking up at the large clock on the table next to Professor Marchbanks . 
He sits right behind Parvati Patil , her long black hair dangling down on the back of her chair . 
Once or twice , he noticed that he was staring at the tiny golden light that reflected on her hair every time she moved her head , and she had to shake her own head to remove the image . that . 
The first supreme leader of the International Federation of Witchcraft was Pierre Bonaccord , but his appointment was not recognized by the Liechtenstein witch community , because - 
But the brush around Harry was scraping on the parchment like the mice were digging . 
The sun shone brightly behind his head . 
What did the Bonaccord insult Liechtenstein's witches ? 
Harry felt that it was something related to the giants that glanced at him unintentionally at a point in the back of Parvati's head again . 
If it could execute the Legilimency mantra to open the window behind her head and find out what was involved with the giant that caused the conflict between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein 
Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands , causing his reddened eyelids to sink into the darkness and become more comfortable . 
Bonaccord wanted to stop chasing the giants and empowering them , but Liechtenstein was in trouble with a group of wild and dangerous mountain - dwellers . 
He opened his eyes ; Her eyes were spicy and full of water as she looked at the white paper spread out in front of her . 
Slowly , it wrote about two lines about the giants , and read how it did . 
Its article does not seem to have much information and is not very detailed , although it is certain that the books of this federation are very detailed from page to page . 
He closed his eyes again , trying to recall the notebooks , trying to remember that the Federation had first met in France , yes , it wrote about it . 
The goblins who tried to get involved and got chased away also wrote about it 
And no Liechtenstein representative wanted to attend 
Think about it , he said to himself , his hands hugging his face , around him , his shaven wrists scraping the endless answers and the sand running through the hourglass in front of him . 
He was walking along the dark and cool corridor of the Department of Mysteries , full of determination and deliberate , occasionally switch to run , determined to reach the black door again open swing as usual , and it stood in the round chamber with countless doors 
Stepping on the stone floor and through the second door the light jumps on the walls and floors and the strange , strange iron sounds , but it does not have time to explore , it must quickly 
He ran the final steps to the third door , still open and swaying like the others 
Again , it was in the big room like a cathedral filled with glass spheres . Her heart was beating so fast this time that it would reach it when it came to the ninety - seven it turns left and rushes along the path between the two rows 
But there is a figure at the end of the line , a black figure motionless on the floor like an injured animal . Harry's stomach twists with fear with a little excitement . 
A voice escaped from his mouth , a cold , high - pitched , non - human voice 
Get it for us to get it down , right now I can not touch it but you can 
The colored figure on the floor softly moved . 
Harry saw a white hand with long fingers clutching his wand , raising it up to hear the cold , soaring voice saying , ' Crucio ! ' 
The man on the floor screams in pain , trying to stand up but collapses in pain . 
Harry laughed . 
He raised his wand , read the curse , shrieked and became motionless . 
Lord Lord Voldemort is waiting 
Slowly , his arms trembling , the man on the floor raised his shoulder to a few inches and raised his head . 
The face of the man is bloody and very haggard , wrinkled with pain but seems to be defying everything . 
' You must kill me , ' Sirius whispered . 
' No doubt we will do it , ' a cold voice said . ' But you must give it to me first , Black you think you can endure more pain ? 
Think about it . We have a lot of time and no one can hear your scream . 
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered the wand again ; Someone cried out and fell from the warm table to the cold stone floor ; Harry woke up when it hit the floor , was still screaming , scars burned hot as the whole Hall around it . 
Chapter 32 : Over Fire 
I do not want to go to the clinic I do not want to 
Harry stammered as he tried to escape Professor Tofty , who was looking at Harry with great concern after helping him out of the hall while the students around him were staring at them . 
I'm fine , Professor , Harry stammered and wiped the sweat on his face . Actually I just fell asleep and had a nightmare 
The pressure of the exam ! The old man said sympathetically , patted Harry on the shoulder . It can happen , boy , by accident ! 
Now drink a glass of cold water and maybe you ' ll be ready to go back to the hall . 
The exam is about to end but you can still finish the last sentence for good 
Yes , Harry says idly I want to say no I'm done - all I can do , I think 
Very good , very good ! 
I will take your post and I think you should take a break 
I will do it . Harry nodded so much to the professor 
As soon as the shadow of the professor fell on the threshold of the hall , Harry ran up the marble stairs , along the corridor through the grumbling portraits , through the moving stairs , and finally through the wings . Double doors into the clinic as a hurricane , causing Mrs. Pomfrey - who is putting the light green drug into the Montagues mouth - must shout a warning . Potter , what do you think you are doing ? 
I need to meet Professor McGonagall Harry gasped . 
Right now it is urgent ! 
She was not here , Potter Pomfrey said sadly she was transferred to St . Mungo Hospital this morning . 
Four Spells on her breast at her age ? 
It was wonderful that they did not kill her . 
Do you go ? Harry felt shocked . 
The bell rang outside the dorm and it heard the rumbling of students as they poured out into the upper and lower corridors . 
He was still staring at Pomfrey . 
Terror is rising in it . 
There is no one left to announce . 
Dumbledore went , Hagrid went , but he still hoped Professor McGonagall was there , impatient and tough , perhaps , but always able to trust , especially in this moment . 
I was not surprised when I was shocked , Potter said , with a very agreeable look on his face . It was as if one of them could charm her in the daytime . 
Hell , it can be said to be despicable if we do not worry about what might happen to you if you do not have me then I have resigned to protest . 
Yes , Harry said absently . 
She turned and stepped out of the clinic , walking in a crowded corridor , thrust by the crowd , panic rising in it like a poison that made her head dizzy and it did not know what to do 
Ron and Hermione , a voice in his head . 
She runs again , pushing the students out , ignoring their angry protest . 
It ran at full speed , down to two floors and to the top of the marble staircase , it saw two children running towards it . 
Harry ! Hermione first looked scared . What's going on ? Are you okay ? 
Are you sick ? 
Where did you go ? Asked Ron . 
go with me . 
Come on , I have this thing to tell you 
He pulled them along the first floor corridor , peered through the doorway , and finally found an empty classroom , which came in and closed as soon as Ron and Hermione came in , leaning against the door and looking at them . 
Voldemorts took Sirius 
What ? 
How do you know - ? 
I see . 
Just finished . 
When I fall asleep during the test 
But - where ? 
How ? Hermione's face was white . 
I do not know But I know exactly where it is . It was a room in the Duke's Department filled with small glass spheres and they were at the end of the ninety - seven he was trying to use Sirius to get something he wanted to be there . He said that he would finally kill him ! . 
Harry's voice trembled . its knees too . 
He went to a table , sat on it and tried to master himself . 
How can we get there ? Harry asked the two of them . 
Silent . 
Then Ron said , come on ? 
to the Department of Confidentiality , we can save Sirius ! Said Harry loudly . 
But ... Harry Ron said weakly . 
What ? 
What ? Harry interrupted Ron . 
He could not understand why they both stared at him as if he was asking them to do something too great . 
Harry Hermione said in a more frightened voice how did Voldemort get into the Ministry without any recognition ? 
How do I know ? Harry screams . The question now is how can we get there ! 
But Harry , think this Hermione stepped up to it , now it's five o ' clock . The magic set is filled with people working on how Voldemort and Sirius can go in without being spotted ? 
Harry , they are two of the most sought after witches in the world . Do you think they can enter a tower filled with the gods without being detected ? 
I do not know , Voldemort can use invisibility cloak or something ! Harry says loudly Anyway , the Department of Confidentiality is always uninhabited every time we go there . 
You've never been there , Harry , said Hermione . All he ever dreamed of was it . 
That is not normal dreams ! Harry screamed at her face , stood up and in turn approached her . 
She wants to shake her mind , so how do you explain Ron's trilogy , about all that , how can I know what happened to her ? 
But this is - it can not happen ! Hermione said desperately Harry , how could Voldemort catch Sirius when he was at Grimmauld Square ? 
Sirius can escape just to have a little air in his voice Ron worried he was desperate out of that house last year ... 
But why , Hermione continued to protest , Why Voldemort wanted to use Sirius to get that weapon , or anything like that . 
I do not know , there may be a whole bunch of reasons ! Harry yelled . Maybe Sirius is Voldemort who does not have to worry about him being hurt or not . 
You know , I just thought of something , Ron raised his voice . 
Sirius's brother is a Death Eater , is not it ? 
Maybe he told Sirius how to get the weapon secretly 
True - and that explains why Dumbledore was so keen to keep Sirius in the house all day long ! Said Harry . 
Listen , I'm sorry , " cried Hermione , " but both of you are not sure and we have no evidence for this , there is no proof that Voldemort and Sirius are there ... " 
Hermione , Harry saw them ! Ron retorted . 
All right , she said , looking a bit scared but determined I have to say this ... 
What's up ? 
This is not criticism , Harry ! 
But what action do you think you are - do you think you are a bit like - the obsession of responsibility to save people ? she said . 
He glared at her . So what is supposed to be responsible for saving people ? 
Well , she looked scared more than ever . I mean , last year in the lake when the Magic Trial you did not need me to say , you did not have to save Delacour's sister but he brought it with you . 
An angry wave of thunder in Harry , how can she make it remember that stupid now ? 
I mean , that's really good for you and for everything Hermione said quickly , looking almost petrified when she looked at Harry's face , everyone thought it was really great ... 
It was funny , Harry whistled through his teeth , because I remember very well Ron said that he had wasted time acting like a hero - what was he thinking ? 
You think you want to be a hero again ? 
No , not so ! Hermione looks scared . I do not mean to 
Good , then say what you want to say , because we're wasting time here ! Harry screamed . 
I'm trying to say this - Voldemort understands you , Harry ! 
He brought Ginny down to the secret chamber to trick him in , it was the way he did , he knew he was the kind of man ... who would go help Sirius ! What would happen if or trying to trick him into the Department of Confidentiality ... ? 
Hermione , he did it to lure him or not , it was not important - they took Professor McGonagall to St Mungo Hospital , where there were no members of the Society to tell , and if they I will not go , Sirius will die ! 
But Harry ... what if your dream is just .... just a dream ? 
Harry screamed in disappointment . 
Hermione almost stepped back , looking very enlightened . 
I do not dream ! Harry screamed at her face , I did not have nightmares , I did not dream ! 
What do you think of all the Occlumency , why do not you think that Dumbledore wants him not to see that ? 
Because they are real , Sirius was arrested , only one person could save him , and if he did not want to go , fine , but I would go , do you understand ? 
And if I remember correctly , he did not have a problem with the obsession to save his people when he was saved from the Dementors , or - it turned to Ron when he Your girl was saved from Tu Xa . 
I did not say I had a problem with that ! Ron was angry . 
But this Harry , I said this many times , said fiercely Hermione , Dumbledore wanted him to learn the Vampire Curse to stop that stuff from his mind , if he had finished it he would never see see this ... . 
IF YOU WANT THAT THAT YOU WILL SEE WHAT YOU DO NOT SEE WHAT ... " 
Sirius told him that nothing was more important than he learned to freeze the mind 
BEHIND YOU HAVE TO SAY OTHERWISE IF IT KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BE ... 
The classroom door opened . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione turned around . 
Ginny comes in , looking curious , followed closely by Luna , who looks as though she accidentally splashed it . 
Hi , Ginny hesitated . We hear you scream . 
What are you talking about ? 
It's not my job , Harry said gruffly . 
Ginny raised her eyebrows . No need to speak like that to me , she said coldly , I was just wondering if she could help me . 
Well , I can not help it , Harry said shortly . 
You're getting rude , you know , Luna said softly . 
Harry cursed and turned away . The last thing he might want to do now is talk to Luna Lovegood . 
Wait , Hermione said suddenly , waiting for Harry , they could help . 
Harry and Ron looked at her . 
Listen , she said urgently , Harry , we need to know exactly if Sirius really left the headquarters . 
I said already , I saw ... 
Harry , please , please ! Said Hermione desperately . 
Please check if Sirius really is not there before we go to London . 
If we know for sure that he is not at home , I swear I will not stop him . 
I will go , I will do anything to save him . 
Sirius is tortured ! Harry yelled . We have no time to waste . 
But if that were Voldemort's trick , Harry , let's go check , we have to go . 
How ? Asked Harry . How can we test it ? 
We will use Umbridge's fireplace and see if we can contact Sirius or not . Hermione looks so terrified when we think of it , we ' ll cheat Umbridge out somewhere , but we need to watch out . , and so we need Ginny and Luna . 
Although struggling to understand what was going on , Ginny said right away , yes , we would do that , and Luna said , when he said Sirius , was he talking about Stubby Boardman ? bearded men on wanted pictures ) ? 
No one answered her . 
All right , Harry told Hermione , all right , if you think about how to do it fast , I ' ll follow you , otherwise I ' ll go to the Department of Holiness right now . 
Department of confidentiality ? Luna looks a little surprised . But how did you get there ? 
Once again Harry ignored her . 
Then Hermione turned her hands together and knocked on the table . Finished , one of us had to look for Umbridge and ... and drive her away , keeping her away from her office . 
That person could tell her ... I do not know ... that Peeves were doing something bad all the time 
I ' ll do it , Ron said right away . I ' ll tell her that Peeves broke the Transfiguration class or something , that it was far away from her office . 
I can certainly convince Peeves to do that if I meet him . 
In such a grave situation , Hermione did not object to breaking the Transfiguration class . 
Then , the little girl said , her brow furrowed as she continued , Now we need to keep the other students away from the office when we go in , otherwise the Slytherins will see to tell her . 
Luna and I will stand at the ends of the corridor , Ginny says right away , and warns people not to go over because someone has spit gas . Hermione looked surprised at Ginny's suggestion as he tipped the trick ; Ginny shrugged and said , Brother Fred and George had planned to do it before they left school . 
Good , Hermione said . And then , Harry , you and I would wrap our invisibility cloak in the office and he could talk to Sirius . 
.... 
He was not there , Hermione ! 
I mean , you can ... can check if Sirius is at home while I watch you , I do not think you should be there alone , Lee made a hole in the door Drop and drop into the Nifflers room . 
Despite his anger and impatience , Harry realized that Hermione's proposal to go with her into Umbridge's office was a sign of solidarity and loyalty . 
I'm fine , thank you , it whispered . 
Okay , even if we do all that , I do not think we have more than five minutes , Hermione said , looking relieved as Harry seemed to have accepted her plan , no . There were both Filch and the haters in the apprenticeship team around . 
Five minutes is enough , Harry says Come on , let's go ... 
Now ? Hermione looked shocked . 
Of course now ! Harry was angry . Do you think we ' ll wait until after dinner ? 
Hermione , Sirius is being tortured right now ! . 
I - okay , she said desperately . 
You go get the Invisibility Cloak and we ' ll meet at the end of the corridor with Umbridge's office , okay ? 
Harry did not answer , ran out of the room and ran through the crowd outside the hallway . 
On the second floor , he meets Seamus and Dean , who are calling him cheerfully and saying that they are preparing a nightly party to celebrate the end of the exam in the common room . 
Harry barely noticed them , he went through the portrait hole when they were arguing about the number of black beers that they needed and then climbed out , Sirius ' invisibility cloak and magic knife . Lie safely in his bag before the other party realized it was gone . 
Harry , do you want some Galleons ? Harold Dingle said he could sell us a few Fire Whiskers . 
But Harry ran very fast along the corridor , and a few minutes later he jumped over the last stairs to meet Ron , Hermione , Ginny and Luna , discussing at the end of Umbridge's corridor . 
I got it , he gasped . Ready to move ? 
All right , Hermione whispered as a bunch of noisy sixth students passed through them . Then Ron - you go and drag Umbridge away Ginny , Luna , if we can tell everyone to avoid this hallway Harry and she will wear invisibility and wait until the corridor no one 
Ron's stride , his bright red hair appearing at the end of the corridor , while Ginny's glowing head shook among the students who were jostling around them in the other direction pointed out by the head . Luna's gold hoe . 
Get out of here , Hermione whispered , tugging Harry's wrist and pushing it into a niche that placed a stone's ugly head from a medieval witch standing murmured alone with the pillar . 
Are you sure you're fine , Harry ? 
His face was pale . 
I'm fine , he said short , pulling the invisibility cloak out of his pocket . 
Actually , its scar was hurt , but not as severe as it thought Voldemort had tortured Sirius very hard . 
It hurt a lot more than when Voldemort punished Avery 
Here , it covered the shirt over them , they stood there and heard Latin murmured from a person in front of them . 
People can not go over here ! Ginny was calling the crowd . No , sorry , you have to go round with the rotating staircase , somebody has sprayed Gas causing choking along the corridor .... 
You can hear the voices of people complaining , a harsh voice I do not see any gas . 
Because it's not color , Ginny says in a persuasive tone , but if you want to go over , just do it , then we ' ll use your body to prove what I'm saying to the next idiots who do not believe . we . 
Slowly , the crowd was slowing . 
The news of Choking Gas seems to have spread , people do not go that way . 
Finally when the area was completely deserted , Hermione whispered , I think it was time to go in there , Harry ... let's go . 
Two children came in , covered with Invisibility Cloak . 
Luna was standing with her back to them at the end of the corridor . 
As they passed Ginny , Hermione whispered , " Good job , and do not get your password . " 
What is a password ? Harry whispered , as they reached the office door . 
A Weasley chorus is our king if they see Umbridge turn around , Hermione answers as Harry puts the blade into the gap between the door and the wall . 
The key click and open . 
They went into the office . 
The brightly colored cat was warming in the afternoon sunshine , but the office was the same as when it was finally there . 
Hermione sighed with relief . 
I thought she might have added some protective measures after the second Niffler . 
They pulled down the invisibility cloak . Hermione strode to the window and hid in a corner , peering down at the arm grasp the wand . 
Harry rushed to the heater , picked up a group of Floo powder and threw it into the grate , firing a flame of green . 
He knelt and buried his head in the fire and shouted , No . 12 , Grimmauld Place ! . 
His head began to spin as if he had just come out of the swing , though his knees were still kneeling firmly on the cold floor . 
He tried to keep his eyes from getting soot and when the spins stopped he opened his eyes and found himself looking at the long and cold stove at Grimmauld Place . 
There was nobody . 
It was assumed that , though unprepared for the wave of fear and panic that seemed to blow up his stomach when he saw the room was deserted . 
Sirius ? it screams . Are you there ? 
His voice echoes across the room , but there is no answer except the slurring from the right of the decor . 
Who's that ? he called , wondering if it was a mouse . 
Kreacher crept into Harry's eyes . 
It looked very pleased with something , although it seemed to have suffered a severe injury in both hands , being covered . 
It was Potter's head in the flames , Kreacher said to the empty stove , peeking at Harry with a weird look . Kreacher wondered what it was like to come here . 
Where's Sirius , Kreacher ? Asked Harry . 
The elf laughed out loud . 
The boss went out , Harry Potter . 
Where did he go ? 
Where did he go , Kreacher ? 
Kreacher just giggled alone . 
I warned him ! Harry was fully aware that his chance to inflict punishment on Kreacher was entirely absent . What about Lupine ? 
Eyes crazy ? 
Some of them , is there any of them ? 
No one but Kreacher ! The elf spoke happily , and with his back turned , he began walking slowly toward the door at the end of the dining room . Kreacher thinks that it will speak to her mistress now , yes , she has not had that chance for a long time , the owner of Kreacher has forbidden it from talking to her . 
Where did Sirius go ? Harry screamed behind the elf . 
Kreacher , did he go to the Department of Confidentiality ? 
Kreacher stopped . 
Harry could not see his bald head through a forest of chairs in front of him . 
The owner did not tell this miserable Kreacher where the owner came , the little elf said . 
But he knows ! Harry yelled . Right ? 
You know where Sirius is coming ! . 
A little silent , then the ejaculator pop out a whistling laugh louder . 
The owner will not return from the Department of Confidentiality ! he said happily . Kreacher and her mistress are lonely again ! 
And it ran forward and disappeared behind the door of the room . 
You ... ! 
But before Harry could utter a curse or insults , he felt a headache , he inhaled a lot of soot and cough , seeing it being pulled back through the fire with rudeness . until he was staring at Umbridge's pale , pale face , who had grabbed his hair and pulled back from the fireplace and was now shaking his neck backward as hard as he could . It can withstand , as if she was about to cut her neck . 
As he thought about it , she whispered , pulling Harry's neck even more forcefully , making it possible to see the ceiling , after the two Nifflers , letting a more filthy creature enter my office . know ? 
I've got a sneaky spy on the door after the last one , stupid kid . 
Grabbing her wand , she shouted to somebody that she could not see , and felt a frown in her jacket pocket and took the wand . and her baby . 
Harry heard a scuffle at the door and knew that Hermione had been stripped of her wand . 
I want to know why it's in my office , Umbridge said , shaking the hand that held his hair so it staggered . 
I just ... try to get the lightning broom ! Harry moaned . 
Lie . She shook her head again . The broomstick of the game was strictly guarded in the bunker , as you know very well , Potter . Your head is in the fireplace . 
Who are you contacting ? 
No one ... Harry tried to pull out of her . 
He felt some hair sticking to his scalp . 
Lie ! Umbridge yelled . 
She threw it down on the table . 
Now he could see Hermione pressed against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode . 
Malfoy was leaning against the window , smirking as he threw Harry's wand into the air and then caught it again . 
Outside there was a noise and a larger group of Slytherins came in . Each of them grabbed Ron , Ginny , Luna , and - with Harry's embarrassment - Neville , squeezed by Crabbe and looking as if it was choking . breathe . 
All four were silenced . 
Get all of them , Warrington said , pushing Ron roughly into the room . This guy , with his stubby fingers on Neville , tried to stop me from catching her , pointing at Ginny , trying to kick the big Slytherin girl who was grabbing her . So I took it with me . 
Good , good Umbridge look at Ginny struggling . Well , it looks like Hogwarts will soon become a no - flood zone - Weasley ? 
Malfoy laughed slyly . 
Umbridge smiled at Ginny with a smug smile on his face . 
He sat down on a cushion covered with colorful flowers , winking at her prisoners like a frog sitting in a flowerpot . 
Then Potter , she said . 
I arranged some watchmen around my office and you sent this clown , and she poked her chin at Ron - Malfoy even laughed - to tell me that the goblin was wreaking havoc in the classroom . Transfiguration while we know exactly that it is inking on the glasses at the astronomy class - Filch just informed us that . 
Obviously , there is something very important to tell someone . is Albus Dumbledore ? 
Or is the giant hybrid Hagrid ? 
I suspect that it might be Minerva McGonagall , I know that she was so badly wounded that it was hard to talk to anyone . 
Malfoy and several more of the Ombudsman's team laughed harder at hearing that . 
Harry felt anger and hatred rising to his throat , causing it to tremble . 
I talk to someone who is not her business , it growls . 
The face of Umbridge , who looked bored , seemed to be stretched . 
Very well , she said in the most dangerous and sweet voice . Very good , Potter gave us a chance to recount . 
If the game refuses . 
I have no choice but to force the game . 
Draco 
... look for Professor Snape . 
Malfoy took Harry's wand into his cloak and left the room with a silly smile , but Harry barely noticed it . 
It suddenly came to mind ; She could not believe it was so stupid to forget it . 
He thought that all the members of the Society , all those who could help him save Sirius , had gone - but he was mistaken . 
There is still a member of the Phoenix Society at Hogwarts - Snape . 
There was silence in the office except for the rustling and the sound of something being dragged away by the efforts of the Slytherin students to keep Ron and the others under control . 
Lam's lips bleed into the carpet as he struggled against Warrington ; Ginny was still trying on her leg in the sixth lock of her hands ; and Hermione in the effort , with no results , pushed Millicent Bulstrode out of the little girl . 
However , Luna , standing weakly beside the man who had caught her , stared blankly out of the window as if somewhat distressed by the incident . 
Harry turned to look at Umbridge , looking at him intently . 
He kept a gentle face and did not express his feelings intentionally when he heard footsteps from the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy went into the room , followed closely by Snape . 
Would you like to meet me , the principal ? Snape said , looking around at all the pairs of students struggling with a completely indifferent attitude . 
Well , Professor Snape , Umbridge said , with wide smile and standing up again . Yes , I want a bottle of pill , as fast as I can , please . 
She used my last bottle of Pill for questioning Potter , Snape watching her calmly through her greasy black hair . Surely she has not used it yet ? 
I told her that three drops were enough . 
Umbridge is confused . 
Can you do more , right ? Her voice was as sweet as a girl like when she was angry . 
Of course , Snape's lips curled up . It needs a full moon cycle to complete , so I ' ll have it for you within a month . 
One month ? Umbridge cried out , his mouth bulging like a frog . 
One month ! 
But I need it tonight , Snape ! 
I just caught Potter using my fireplace to get in touch with a person or group of people ! 
Really ? Snape said , for the first time showing a faint hint of excitement , as he looked around Harry . Oh , that did not surprise me . 
Potter never paid attention to the school's rules . 
His dark eyes were staring at Harry's eyes , and he caught his gaze calmly , concentrating his attention on what he saw in his dream , hoping that Snape will read it from the mind it , to be able to understand 
I want to interrogate it ! Umbridge repeated angrily , and Snape stopped looking at Harry and turned back to her shaking face with anger . I want you to give me something that can catch him telling me the truth ! 
I told her , Snape said softly , that I was no longer stockpiling . 
Unless you want to poison Potter - and I assure you that I will have great empathy with you if you do that - I can not help you . The only trouble is that most of the toxins work so fast that the victims do not have the time to tell the truth . 
Snape looked back at Harry , also staring at him , trying frantically to transfer information without using words . 
Voldemort had arrested Sirius in the Department of Confidentiality , thinking it desperately . 
Voldemort captured Sirius . 
You are challenged ! Umbridge screamed , and Snape turned to look at him , his brows raising a little . He is becoming useless in a deliberate way ! 
I look forward to more than that , Lucius Malfoy always appreciates him ! 
Now come out of my office . 
Snape bowed to him sarcastically , and turned back to leave the room . 
Harry knew that it was his last chance to tell the Society what was going on outside . 
He caught his feet stuffed ! it screamed . He caught the stuffed feet where it was hidden " 
Snape stopped when the hand was on the knob of the office door . 
Stuffed legs ? Umbridge screamed , looking eagerly from Harry to Snape . 
What is stuffed legs ? 
Where is that hiding ? What does that mean , Snape ? 
Snape looked around Harry . 
His face was very mysterious . 
Harry could not tell whether he understood or not , but he did not dare to speak more clearly in front of Umbridge . 
I have no idea , Snape said coldly . 
Potter , when we want something unreasonable to scream in our face , we will give a bottle of drink to babble . 
And Crabbe , loosened his hand a little . 
If Longbottom suffers from suffocation , that means there will be tons of paperwork to do and we are afraid that we will have to mention that in the evaluation of the game when the job application is made . 
He closed the door very quickly , leaving Harry in a worse condition than before . 
Snape was his last hope . 
He looked at Umbridge , who seemed to be feeling the same , looking angry and disappointed . 
Very well , she said , and drew the wand . Very good I was left with no choice other than the discipline of the school is the security of the Ministry right 
She seems to be telling herself something . 
She stepped forward nervously , stepping up to her feet , staring at Harry , thrashing the wand into her palms and breathing heavily . 
When she looked at her , she felt helpless because there was no wand . 
I'm forcing you , Potter I do not want to do that , Umbridge keeps banging his wand on the palm , but sometimes in some cases justifying his use I'm sure the Department will understand that . There is no other choice 
Malfoy was staring at her with a thirst on her face . 
The curse will be taken from your tongue , Umbridge whispered . 
Are not ! Cried Hermione . Professor Umbridge - that is illegal . 
But umbridge did not notice . 
There was a fierce enthusiasm and excitement on the face that Harry had never seen before . 
She raised her wand . 
I do not want you to break the law , Professor Umbridge ! Cried Hermione . 
What Cornelius did not know would not hurt him , Umbridge was panting as she pointed her wand in different parts of Harry's body , seemingly trying to decide where the pain would be . Best . He never knew I had sent the Dementors to chase Potter last summer , but he was glad to have the opportunity to expel him , all the same . 
Is it you ? Harry gasped in surprise . Did you dare to chase me ? 
Someone must act , Umbridge breathes out , when his wand decides to point directly to Harry's forehead . They're all bragging about catching you shut one way or another - or losing your credibility - but I'm the one who really did something for that , just the way you spit it . , is not it , Potter ? 
But today is not , now not ... " . 
And take a deep breath , she roars , Cruc - 
ARE NOT ! Cried Hermione in a repressed voice behind Millicent Bulstrode . Are not ... 
Harry ... we're going to tell her ! 
No way ! Harry screamed , staring at Hermione's glittering silhouette that he could see . 
We have to do that , Harry , anyway she will make you say , so ... so what's the deal ... ? " 
And Hermione began to cry weakly behind Millicent Bulstrode's robe . 
Millicent immediately stopped trying to force her to the wall . 
Good good good ! Umbridge looks so happy . Q - Throughout this little baby will give us some answers . " 
Er - my - nee - no ! Shouted Ron while still covering his mouth . 
Ginny stared at Hermione as if she had never seen her before . 
Neville , still choking , was looking at her as well . 
But Harry realized something . 
Although Hermione was desperately thirsty in her hands , there was no sign of tears . 
I ... I'm sorry , but ... I can not stand it .... 
Very true , very true , girl ! Umbridge grabbed Hermione's shoulder , pushed her into the hideous cloth seat , and leaned back toward her . Now who is the Potter who wants to contact you ? 
Oh , Hermione took a deep breath in her hands , well , she was trying to contact Professor Dumbledore . 
Ron died hard , eyes wide open . 
Ginny did not step on the toe of the Slytherin student holding her , and even Luna looked surprised . 
Fortunately , Umbridge's attention and her henchmen are focusing too much on Hermione alone to find the sign of suspicion . 
Dumbledore ? Umbridge was eager . You know where Dumbledore is , huh ? 
Oh no ! Hermione sobbed . We tried to find in the cauldron , in the alley and the Three Trumpets and even the Heo ... 
Stupid boy - Dumbledore will not sit in the bar while the whole ministry is looking for him ! Umbridge screamed , frustration bubbling up on each side of her face . 
But ... we have to tell the professor something very important ! Hermione moaned , her hands clasped in her face , Harry knew , not because of pain , but to hide the absence of tears . 
Huh ? Umbridge said suddenly excitedly . What do we want to tell you ? 
We would like to say to professors that all has s - ready ! Cried Hermione . 
What's ready ? Umbridge asked , and now she grabbed Hermione's shoulder again and shook it . What's ready , girl ? 
The weapon , Hermione said . 
Weapon ? 
What weapons ? Said Umbridge , and her eyes almost exploded with pleasure . We are developing a method of resistance ? 
Can a weapon be used against the Ministry ? 
At Dumbledore's command , of course ? 
- That's right , Hermione gasped , but he had to go before it was done and b - b - now we finished it for him , and we - could not find him . e - to say it ! 
What kind of weapon is that ? Umbridge said harshly , her short and fat hands clutching Hermione's shoulders . 
We can not - really understand it , says Hermione , sniffing loudly . We just do what g - g - Professor Dumbledore told us l - l - do . 
Umbridge straightened up , looking very happy . 
Lead us to the weapon , she said . 
I will not only when there are floods , Hermione shrieked , looking at the Slytherins through her fingers . 
Not that the person was conditioned , Umbridge's voice was cynical . 
Good , Hermione said , now sobbing in her hands , Good to let them see it , I hope the crowd will apply it to her ! 
Well , in fact , I want you to invite a lot , a lot of people come and see ! Would that satisfy you ? Well , I would love it if c - the whole school knows where it is , and how to d - use it , and then if she annoys them , They will be able to l - eliminate you ! 
Those words had a great impact on Umbridge , who turned to look immediately , suspiciously of all her investigative team , her protruding eyes pausing for a moment at Malfoy , trying to hide her impatience . cries and desires appear on the face . 
Umbridge looked at Hermione and thought for a moment , then said very clearly what she thought in the voice of a mother . 
Okay , honey , leave this alone , and we and we will bring Potter , huh ? get up , right 
Professor Malfoy said enthusiastically , Professor Umbridge , I think some of the team members should go with the professor to watch over ... 
Am I a full - fledged Ministry of Justice , Malfoy , who really thinks I can not handle two teenagers without a wand alone ? Umbridge asked sharply . In any case , it seems that this weapon is something that students should not see . 
You should stay here till we come back and make sure none of them - she gestures to Ron , Ginny , Neville and Luna - escape . 
Yes , Malfoy said , sulking and disappointed . 
And we two go ahead and show us the way , Umbridge pointing his wand at Harry and Hermione . 
Come on . 
CHAPTER 33 : LIGHT AND FLASH 
Harry had no idea about Hermione's plan , or even if she had any plans . 
He walked behind her a half - step as they descended down the hall outside Umbridge's office , knowing that he would make her ( now I can call him ' she ' ? do not know where they are going 
She did not even dare to talk to the girl , Umbridge was still so close to her that she could hear her uneven breathing . 
Hermione goes down the stairs leading into the Hall . 
There was a faint sound of loud voices and the clatter of the knife from the large door in the Hall - it seemed unbelievable to Harry when only 20 feet away , people were enjoying the dinner . , celebrate the completion of the exam , not to worry about anything in the world 
Hermione went straight through the oak front door , down the stone stairs in the mellow air of the evening . 
The sun set behind the trees in the forest . And when Hermione strode deliberately across the lawn - with Umbridge walking behind them - the shadows behind them curled in the grass like shirts . cape . 
Is it hidden in Hagrid's tent ? Umbridge's voice was eager . 
Of course not , Hermione mocked . Uncle Hagrid will accidentally start it lost . 
Yes , Umbridge looks more excited . Yes , he would , of course , the stupid hybrid wizard . 
Smile . 
Harry felt a strong impulse to turn around and grab her throat , but it stopped . 
The scar was throbbing in the calm atmosphere of the evening , but the pain was not as bright as when Voldemort was about to kill someone . 
Where is it ? Umbridge said , one with a bit of uncertainty in his voice as Hermione went straight into the forest . 
Inside of it , of course , Hermione pointed to the dark forest . It must be in a place where students can not accidentally find out , right ? 
Of course , Umbridge answered although she heard her voice now a little afraid . That's good , so let's go ahead . 
If we go ahead , can we handle your wand ? Harry asked her . 
No , I do not think so , Potter , Umbridge sweet , pushed on his back . I'm afraid the Ministry values ​​ our lives better than ours 
When they reached the shadow of the first tree , Harry tried to capture Hermione's look ( trying to get Hermione to look at him , to understand what he was thinking ) ; Going into the forest without a wand for it seems to be recklessly foolhardy than anything they have done until tonight . 
However , she merely gave Umbridge a scornful look and headed straight into the woods , striding her to make Umbridge , with her shorter legs , unable to keep up . 
It was very deep in the forest , she asked as her gown was raked by a bush . 
Yes , Hermione said , it was hiding very well . 
Harry's suspicion gradually increased . 
Hermione does not follow the path they traveled to Grawp , but the path she had taken three years ago , to the nest of the Aragog monster ( Acromantula - the giant spider Hagrid had raised before - Episode 2 : Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret - ND ) . 
Hermione did not accompany her at the time , suspecting that she had no idea what the danger was . 
Oh ... are you sure you're on the right track ? he asked her in a meaningful way . 
Oh yeah , she said in a stern voice and broke a bush when she passed it with the noise that Harry thought was unnecessary . Behind them , Umbridge stumbled into a dead tree . 
Both of them did not stop to help her , Hermione strode and spoke loudly over her shoulders , not turning her back . There was only a short distance left ! 
Hermione , whispered , Harry whispered , hurrying to catch her . Anything can be heard here ... 
I want us to be discovered , she whispered as Umbridge walked humming behind them . Then you will see 
They go for a long time , until they are very deep in the forest with dense canopies that cover the light . 
Harry felt the sensation it had before entering the forest , feeling trapped by the undetected eyes . 
How far ? Umbridge demanded anger behind him . 
Not far away ! Said Hermione , as they walked into a dim , damp forest . Just a bit more .... 
An arrow flying in the air and plugged into the trunk with a threatening thud , just over her head . 
Surrounded suddenly with the sound of horses , Harry could feel the ground in the forest shake , Umbridge screamed a small hiss and pushed it forward in front of her as a shield .... 
He twisted out of her and turned around . 
About fifty centaurs appeared on every side , with bowing and mounting names , directed at Harry , Hermione and Umbridge . 
They slowly turned around in the clearing , Umbridge uttered a weird moan for fear . 
Harry looked at Hermione , who had a winning smile . 
Who are you ? a voice said . 
Harry looked left . 
The Native Sagittarius called Magorian was coming out of the siege toward them : its bow , like that of other centaurs , was rising . To the right of Harry , Umbridge was still moaning , her wand shaking violently as she pointed at the approaching centaur . 
I ask you , who are you , my son , Magorian gruffly said . 
I'm Dolores Umbridge ! Umbridge answered , his voice trembling . Vice President of the Ministry of Magic and Principal and Supreme Inspector of Hogwarts ! 
You are the Ministry of Magic ? Asked the Magorian , as the centaurs in the circle around were moving ceaselessly . 
right ! Umbridge's voice was even higher , so be careful ! 
According to the laws of the Department of Management of Mysterious Creatures , the attacks of the hybrid animals as you enter the human . 
What are you calling us ? A black - haired , wild - looking scream , Harry realized it was Bane . 
A mingled sound of angry whispers and strained tresses around them . ( Harry , Hermione and Umbridge ) 
Do not call them that way ! Hermione said angrily . Umbridge did not seem to have heard her . 
Still shaking his wand at the Magorian , she continued , Rule 15 B made it clear that any attack of mysterious creatures with near - like - like creatures was seen . in legal terms . 
.. 
Intelligence is almost like human ? Magorian recalled , as Bane and several other centaurs screamed angrily and knocked the nails to the ground . We regard it as a terrible humiliation , man ! 
Our intellect , fortunately , is far from human . 
What are you in our forest ? a gray horse with a stern face roar . 
Harry and Hermione saw it during their last visit to the forest . Why are you here ? 
Your forests ? Umbridge was trembling not only for fear but also , as if , out of anger . I must remind you that you are living here only because the Ministry gives you a little bit of land . 
An arrow flew very close to her head , trailing her gray hair . 
She screams a loud noise and swings her wand over her head , while several centaurs are shouting approval and others laughing husky . 
The sound of wilderness , the horse echoes echoing through the forest and the scene of the horrific death of human horns , making them lose courage . 
Now who is the owner of the forest ? Bane growled . 
Dirty hybrids ! Umbridge shrieked , still clutching his wand over his head . Uncontrollable animals ! 
Calmly go ! Hermione says aloud , but it's too late : Umbridge points his wand at the Magorian and screams , Incarcerous ! 
The ropes appear from the air like large snakes , wrap them tightly around the centaur's body and tied his hands : it growls with rage and lashes up with its hind legs , trying to liberate itself . , while other centaurs are attacking . 
Harry grabbed Hermione and pushed her to the ground , her face down to the ground of the forest , and she was frightened for a moment as the horse's hoarse thundered around , but the centaurs jumped over them , roaring with anger . evil . 
Oh no ! he heard Umbridge scream . I am not a high - ranking minister , you can not - let me go , dry animals ! 
Harry saw a flash of red light flashing and knew she was trying to cast a spell on them ; Then she screamed loudly . 
Harry raised his head a little and saw Umbridge was snapped up by Bane and raised high up on the ground , writhing and screaming in fear . 
The wand fell from her hand to the ground , and Harry's heart thumped . 
If it can reach the chopsticks ... 
But when it was reaching for the wand , a centaur's nail had stamped on the wand and broke it . 
Now ! Harry heard a roaring voice and a large hand dropped , pulling it straight up , so did Hermione . 
Through the backs and heads of many of the hippies , Harry saw Umbridge being carried by Bane through the trees . 
Without stopping to scream , her voice became weak until they could no longer hear the hoarse sound of horses hovering around them . 
And these guys ? One of the centaurs was grabbing Hermione . 
They were young , a mournful and mournful voice resounded behind Harry . We do not attack the children . 
They brought the other to the place , Ronan , the centaur who was holding Harry to answer . And they are not too young this boy is almost a man . 
He shook Harry with his cloak . 
Please , Hermione gasped , please , do not attack us . 
We do not think like her , we are not civil servants of the Ministry ! 
We just came here because we hope you will kick us out for us . 
Harry realized at that moment , from the look on the face of the gray horn who was seizing Hermione , that she made a terrible mistake when she said it . 
The gray angler turns his head , his hind legs angry , and growls , do you see , Ronan ? 
They started to have arrogance in their nature ! 
So we did the dirty work for you , did not she ? 
Have we acted like your servants , kicking your enemies like obedient hounds ? 
Are not ! Said Hermione in fear . Please ... 
I do not mean that ! 
I just hope you guys can ... help us ... 
But she seemed to only make the situation worse . 
We do not help people ! The centaur holding Harry snarled , holding Harry tighter and cramming a little at that moment , so for a moment Harry felt fallen to the ground . We are another race and proud of it . 
We will not allow you to leave here , boasting that we have followed your orders ! 
We do not say anything like that ! Harry yelled . We know you do not do it just because we want to ... 
But no one seemed to hear it . 
A bearded angler toward the hawks shouted , They came here without being invited , they had to suffer ! 
A roar of approval with those words and a gray - haired centaur said loudly , They could join the woman ! 
You say you do not attack innocent people ! Hermione screamed , tears were streaming down her face . We do not do anything to you , we do not use wand or threat , we just want to go back to school , please let us back ... 
We are not like the traitor to Firenze , that girl ! The gray anthropomorphic crayon , with many more humorous voices from the centaurs . Perhaps you think we are like beautiful horses say ? 
We are ancient inhabitants , who do not want to live with the invasion and derogatory of the witch ! 
We do not follow your rules , do not acknowledge your strengths , we are .... 
But they could not hear what the centaurs were saying , at that moment there was a crack from the edge of the forest so loud that all of them , Harry , Hermione and fifty or so centaurs were standing in the distance . forest , have to look around . 
The centurion drops Harry to the ground again when his hand reaches for the bow and the name . 
Hermione was dropped as well , and Harry rushed toward her as the big trunks were broken and Grawp's huge body appeared in the open . 
The centaurs near Grawp stepped back ; The jungle now is a forest of arrows preparing to shoot , all pointing to a large gray face that appears dimly above the centuries below the thick canopy . 
Grawp's disproportionate mouth was silently yawning , the dazzling gold - colored teeth visible , the dim bricks in the dim light , the stupid gray eyes narrowing as he glanced down at the creatures at the feet . 
The ropes were dragged under his ankles . 
Grawp opened his mouth a little louder . 
Hagger . 
Harry does not know what the hagger means , or what language it is , and he does not care too much ; He was watching Grawp's leg , now nearly as long as Harry's body . 
Hermione held her hand tightly ; The centaurs were also silent , staring at the giant , with a large , rounded head wobbling as it continued to stare at them as if searching for something that had fallen off . 
Hagger ! he roared again , more assertive . 
Get out of here , great stuff ! Magorian shouted . Mi is not welcome in our place ! 
Those words do not seem to have any effect on Grawp . 
It stopped for a while ( The arms of the centaurs still stretched their bowels ) , then it roared , HAGGER ! . 
Some centaurs now look very anxious . 
However , Hermione gasped . Harry ! she whispered . I thought it was trying to say Hagrid ! 
And at that moment Grawp saw two children , the only two in the midst of a centaur . 
He bent his head a few feet or so , staring at them . 
Harry could feel Hermione trembling as Grawp opened his mouth again and said , with a deep , low voice , Hermy . 
Good , Hermione said , holding Harry's hand so tightly that his hands were numb and looked as if the little girl was going to faint , it - he still remembered ! 
HERMY ! Grawp roared . HAGGER ? 
I do not know ! Cried Hermione , scared . I'm sorry , Grawp , I do not know the truth ! 
GRAWP WANT TO HAGGER ! 
A huge hand of the giant down . 
Cried Hermione , stepping back a few steps and stumbling . 
Without a wand , Harry tried his best to punch , kick , bite or anything else when the hand came down and struck the white centaur . ( Harry braced himself to punch , kick , bite or whatever else he took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a snow - white centaur off his legs ) 
That's exactly what the centaurs were waiting for - as Grawp's fingers extended just a foot away from Harry , the fifty arrows soared in the air toward the giant , plugging into the huge face make him howl with pain and anger and stand up straight , holding his face with his big hands , breaking the arrows but making the arrows go deeper . 
It screamed and stroked the giant foot , the centaurs , running scattered in different directions ; Grawp's boulder falls on Harry as he pulls Hermione up , and they run as fast as they can to hide behind the trees . 
As they turned to look , Grawp was searching for the centaurs , blood still flowing on his face ; Mendicants ran away , quickly disappearing behind the trees on the other side of the forest . 
Harry and Hermione glared at Grawp again and hurled at the centaurs , breaking many trees as it passed . 
Oh no , Hermione shivered so hard that her knees collapsed . Oh , terrible . 
It will kill all of them . 
Honestly , I did not find that very important , Harry said sourly . 
The floods of the centenary fled , and the groaning Grawp chased away , gradually narrowing . 
As Harry listened to them , his scars tensed again and a wave of anger began to rise in him . 
They have wasted so much time - they are now far more away from saving Sirius than when it sees the scene . ( That scene - the sight of Sirius captured , alluding to Harry's current location - wandless , in the woods , before it only went to save Sirius ) . 
Not only does Harry lose his wand , he is also trapped in the Forbidden Forest without any means of transportation . 
An intelligent plan , it screamed at Hermione's face , revealing its anger . Really smart . 
Where are we going ? 
We need to return to the castle , Hermione weak . 
When we get back , maybe Sirius is dead ! Harry kicked the tree nearby in anger . 
With a high - pitched whistle , he looked up and saw an angry Bowtruckle bending two long fingers like twigs toward him . 
But we can not do without the wand , desperate Hermione , pulling himself up again . Anyway , Harry , how exactly are you going to London ? 
Oh , we're asking ourselves that too . a familiar voice resounded behind her . 
Harry and Hermione returned instinctively and looked over the trees . 
Ron appeared in the dark , followed closely by Ginny , Neville and Luna . 
All of them looked a little bit pathetic - there were some long gemstones on Ginny's cheeks ; a swollen bump on Neville's right eye ; Ron's lips were bleeding a lot more than before - but all looked satisfied with himself . 
So , Ron pushed a low branch to the side , hand holding Harry's wand , did he have any way ? 
How did you escape ? Harry asked , taking the wand from Ron . 
" Two Stunning Spells , and Neville made a beautiful curse , Ron said happily , now returning the wand to Hermione , but Ginny was the best , giving Malfoy a taste . Bat Bogey ( L ) - Excellent , Malfoy's face is covered by something very big fly . 
Anyway , we saw through the window that you went to the Forbidden Forest and we chased . What did you do to Umbridge ? 
She was taken away , Harry said . To be carried away . 
And they forgive us ? Ginny was surprised . 
No , they were pursued by Grawp . 
Who is Grawp ? Luna enjoyed it . 
Hagrid's brother , Ron answered quickly . No need to worry about that now . 
Harry , what did you find in the fireplace ? 
Is anyone - who - also - know - who - is - who - made Sirius or ... ? 
Yes , its scars are throbbing again , and I'm sure Sirius is still alive , but I do not know how we got there to help him . 
They are silent , look scared ; The problems they face can not be overcome . 
Oh , we ' ll have to fly , right ? Luna said , in a voice close to the real thing that Harry first saw her use . 
All right , Harry snapped back . First of all , we do not do anything if we include us like this , and secondly , only Ron's broom is not guarded by the giant demon , so ... 
I have a broom ! Ginny said . 
Yes , but I will not go there , Ron is angry . 
Sorry but I'm also interested in what happened to Sirius like you ! Ginny said , her jaw suddenly looked like Fred and George . 
I was too - Harry started , but Ginny reacted fiercely , I was three years older than he was when he confronted the Who - who - well - know - who - to protect the Magic Stone . , and thanks to you Malfoy is stuck in the office Umbridge was attacked by a giant three ... 
Yes , but ... 
We are all in the project , Neville whispered . It was designed to fight the Who - knows - who - is - right , right ? 
And this is not the first opportunity for us to do something really ... or is it just a game or something ? 
No ... of course not . Harry was impatient . 
Then we should go , Neville said simply . We want to help . 
Yes . Luna smiled happily . 
Harry's eyes met Ron . 
He knew that Ron was thinking of things like that , if he had to pick a few members in the DA , besides him , Ron and Hermione , to save Sirius , would not pick Ginny , Neville , or Luna . 
Oh , no matter what , Harry hissed through his teeth , because we did not know how to get there . 
I thought we had decided , Luna looked annoyed . We will fly ! 
Look , Ron almost does not crave anger , he can fly without a broom , but the rest can not grow wings every time I ... 
There's another way to fly without a broom , Luna said softly . 
Do you think we will ride on Kacky Snorgle or something like that ? Asked Ron . 
Crumple - The Horned Snorkack does not fly , Luna says in a solemn tone , but the others can , and Hagrid says they are good at finding where the rider is looking . 
Harry looked around . Standing between the two trees , their white eyes flashed strangely ; two Thestrals , watching them whisper to each other as if they could understand each word . 
right ! he whispered , walking towards the two beasts . 
They nodded like a reptilian , sprinkled a long black mane , and Harry eagerly stroked and patted the shiny neck of the nearer ; How could it have been that they were ugly ? 
Are they crazy horses ? Ron's voice was uncomfortable , staring at the left of the Thestral that Harry was stroking . The animals that I can not see unless I saw someone die right ? 
That's right , Harry said . 
How many children ? 
There are only two . 
Oh , we need three , Hermione still looks shaky , but very assertive . 
Four , Hermione , Ginny scowled . 
I think six need for all of us , really , Luna calmly counts . 
Do not be so foolish , all can not go together ! Harry was angry . Take a look , three people ... it points to Neville , Ginny and Luna , Three are not involved in this , the three are not . 
All three of them grew up violently . 
The scars of it stinged again , more painful . 
Each second they stop is precious , it has no time to argue . 
OK , fine , that's your choice , it's cursed , but if we do not find any more Thestrals then you can not ... 
Oh , they would come , Ginny said confidently , although , like Ron , she was squinting in the wrong direction , gesturing as if she were seeing the horses . 
What do you think ? 
Because , in case he does not recognize , he and Hermione are bloody , calm , and we know that Hagrid calls fresh meat Thieves . That's why there are two children appear here . 
At that moment Harry felt someone gently pull his cloak and saw the nearest Thestral licking his sleeves , still glowing with Grawp's blood . 
Okay then , he said , a clever idea came up , Ron and I were going to ride two and go ahead , and Hermione could stay here with three and she would call Thestrals to ... 
I will not stay behind ! Hermione was angry . 
No need , Luna smiled . Look , they came more then the two of you just smell 
Harry turned around : no less than six or seven Thestral was walking through the trees , the skin folded in his body , his eyes flashing in the dark . 
There is no excuse . 
All right , it's irritating to say , pick one up and go . 
Chapter 34 : CONFIDENTIALITY 
Harry wrapped his hand around the nearest Thestral , set his foot on the tree next to him , and crawled awkwardly over the smooth back of the horse . 
The Thestral did not protest , but twisted his head around , the bare canines , and continued to lick Harry's cloak in delight . 
Harry figured out how to place his knees on the wings of the wings for greater certainty , then looked at the others around him . 
Neville tried to lift himself onto the back of the next Thestral and was now trying to swing his short leg through the back of the animal . 
Luna was already in position , she was sitting on one side of the saddle , adjusting her lapel as if she had done this every day . 
Ron , Hermione and Ginny , however , were still standing motionless , their mouth wide and their eyes fixed . 
What's up ? Asked Harry . 
How do we get on ? Said Ron weakly . When will we see these things ? 
Oh , that's easy , Luna said , eagerly slipping off the Thestral and coming to her , Hermione and Ginny . Come here ... 
She pulled three of them near the remaining Thestral standing around and each one wanted to help them up on their backs . 
The three looked anxiously as she wrapped her arms around the mane and told them to hold it firmly before returning to her horse . 
Wanting to go crazy , Ron muttered as he moved his hand to the horse's neck . 
crazy to be ... 
if i could see it ... 
You will wish they were as invisible , Harry said gloomily . 
Are we all ready ? 
All nodded and saw five legs clasped beneath the cloak . 
OK ... " 
He looked down at the Thistle's swarthy black head and swallowed . 
Ministry of Magic , the entrance of the guests , London , then , it hesitated . 
Er ... if you know ... where to go ... 
Harry's Thestral stood still for a moment ; Then , with a quick glide that made him fall out of the saddle , the horse straightened his wings at both sides , slowed his pace , and flicked forward in a swift and steep way . so straight that Harry had to squeeze his hands and knees tightly to avoid slipping back and falling off the horse's bony ass . 
He closed his eyes and squeezed his face down to the mane of the animal's silk , both spilling through the top of the tree and flying into the reddening sky of blood . 
Harry did not think he'd ever move so fast ; The lightning - fast Thestral threw through the castle , its wide wings barely beating ; cool air patted Harry's face ; his eyes narrowed in the wind , he looked around and saw five friends flying right behind him , each bent down as low as possible down the Thestral's neck , trying to avoid himself from slipping . 
They got out of Hogwarts , got past Hogsmeade ; Harry could see the mountains and ditches just below . 
As the daylight was nearing its end , Harry saw the light beams as the horse crossed several more villages , then a winding road , where a lonely car was hurrying to find his way home . through the hills ... 
This is bizarre ! Harry heard Ron's screams in the background , and he began to imagine how the feeling of flying at this speed at this altitude by a completely invisible vehicle would be like . 
Sunset was off : the sky was turning violet with the countless small silver stars , and soon the mere lights of the Muggle town were clear , telling them they were in the dark . How high are they compared to the ground , or how fast they are going ? 
Harry's arms were tight around the horse's neck , and he even wanted the animal to go faster . 
How much time has passed since he saw Sirius fall to the floor of the Department of Confidentiality ? 
How long can Sirius be able to resist Voldemort ? 
All that Harry could know for sure was that his godfather had not done what Voldemort had wanted , nor had he died , because otherwise he would have felt the joy or anger of Voldemort's anger overflowing . Flushed over the body , the scars burned like the night Mr. Weasley was attacked . 
They flew through the dense night , Harry could feel his face hard and cold , his legs numb because he was clutching the Thestral too tight , but he did not dare move the place for fear of slipping . ... his ears were filled with fierce wind that was now filled with eardrums , his mouth was dry and almost frozen by the cold wind . 
It completely lost the sense of how far they have gone ; All of its beliefs lie in the beast beneath it , which is still flashing deliberately through the night , openly flapping its wings as it speeds up forward . 
But if they were too slow ... 
He is still alive , he is still fighting , he feels it ... 
If Voldemort determined that Sirius would not be subdued ... 
I ' ll know ... 
Harry's stomach rose one , the Thestral's head suddenly bent towards the ground and it actually slid a few inches forward along the animal's neck . 
They finally got down ... 
Thinking that he had just heard a scream from behind , he twisted around recklessly , but could not see any sign that someone was falling . 
Maybe the whole group has just come across a shock shift , as it did . 
Ron lowered Harry a short distance and immediately fell off the Thestral and down the sidewalk . 
Will never like this again , says Ron , legs struggling . 
As if striding away from the Thestral , but , unable to see it , it touches the animal's hindquarters and nearly collapses . Never , do not add one more like this ... this is the worst ... " 
Hermione and Ginny landed on either side of Harry , both sliding off their horse more gracefully than Ron , though the same way of revealing relaxation as being touched by a firm ground ; Neville jumped down , trembling and Luna lowered her horse smoothly . 
Where do we go next ? she asked Harry , a polite voice , but with some excitement , as if it was an exciting day trip . 
" Right here , " he said , panting to thank his Thestral , who then led the way to a broken telephone booth and opened the door . 
Come on ! , it urges the rest , when they see the couple are reluctant . 
Ron and Ginny came forward obediently . 
Hermione , Neville and Luna come in later ; Harry glanced at the Thestral , who was now staring at the rotten food in the crate , and forced himself into the telephone booth behind Luna . 
Whoever is closest to the stethoscope , dial 62442 ! it says . 
Ron did this , his arm curled down bizarrely to the button ; When it returned to position , a calm woman's voice rose from the box . 
Welcome to the Ministry of Magic . 
Please state the name , and the place of work . 
Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , Hermione Granger , Harry Swift , Ginny Weasley , Neville Longbottom , Luna Lovegood ... 
We are here to save a person , if the Ministry can not do it first ! 
Thanks , the woman's voice was calm . Visitors , please take the badge and attach it in front of your cloak . 
A dozen badges slipped out of the metal slider and passed to Harry's hand through Ginny's head ; He glanced up at the top , Harry Potter , the rescue team . 
Visitors to the Ministry of Magic , you are required to undergo a search and must introduce the magic wand to register at the security desk , located deep in the same gate . 
Good ! Harry says aloud , when his scars begin to hurt violently . Now we move ? 
The floor of the phone shuddered and the sidewalk rose through the window ; The Thestral looking for food began to slide out of sight ; the black shadow over their heads and with the grinding whistling , all of them sinking to the depths of the Ministry . 
A light yellow light from the cracks touched the small feet and extended , reaching out to cover their bodies . 
Harry curled his knee and held the wand as he prepared to cope with an agony as he gazed intently through the glass to see if anyone was waiting for them Gate , but there it was . nobody . 
The lights were dimmer than in the daytime , there was no fire under the shelf mounted to the wall , but at the same time as the smooth elevator slid into a stop , it saw the gold symbols winding down on the dark blue ceiling . 
The Ministry of Magic wishes you a good night , the woman said . 
The door of the telephone boom suddenly burst out Harry fell out , followed closely behind Neville and Luna . 
The only sound in the entrance gate is the sound of water flowing from the golden nozzle , where the water sprays from the wands of both good and evil , from the pointed end of the bow of the Horses , from the tip of the elves and the ears of the elves , continue to spray water into the surrounding water tank . 
Next , Harry whispered and all six of them ran down the hall , Harry led , crossed the fountain and headed for the table where the witch guarded the door , who had weighed his god , Sit , and are now vacant . 
Harry felt that having a guard in this place was a must , and that their absence was an omen , and that the sense of it was magnified as they crossed the golden gate . go to the elevator . 
He pressed the nearest button and a lift almost immediately hit his eyes , the iron grille slammed out with a loud creaking sound and echoing as they burst into the room . 
Harry hit the button number 9 ; the iron grille closes and the elevator starts lowering , quickening and shrieking . 
Harry did not recognize the noisy elevator when he came here with Mr. Weasley ; And it made sure that the cries could alarm the security guard in this building , but as the elevator stopped , the calm woman's voice echoed the Department of Security , and the iron grate slid open . 
They walked into a corridor . 
Nothing was moving there , in addition to the nearest torch , founding flutter when the wind from the elevator crossed . 
Harry turned to the black door . 
After months of dreaming about it , finally Harry was here . 
Let's go , he whispered , and led the way down the corridor , Luna was behind him , staring around , his mouth open . 
All right , listen , Harry stopped within 6 feet near the door and said . 
Maybe ... maybe some people should stay to ... as if to guard it , and - 
And how do we tell you if something is coming ? Ginny raised an eyebrow . You can stay miles away . 
We ' ll go with you , Harry , Neville said . 
Then go ahead , Ron said emphatically . 
Harry did not want to let everyone follow him , but it seemed like he had no choice . 
She turned to face the door and moved forward ... like in dreams , the door flickered open and she stepped through the doorway , the others clinging to the heel . 
They were standing in a large , round room . 
Everything here is black including the ceiling and the floor ; Black doors without identical handles , not clearly attached to each other around the black wall , in the middle are candles with blue flames ; Their shimmering light reflected on the marble floor looked like there was a secret water line underneath . 
Someone close the door , Harry whispered . 
And he regretted it when Neville made the request . 
There was no torchlight from the corridor , which became so dark for a moment , the only thing they saw was the shining blue light shining on the wall and the ghostly reflection of all the people on the floor . 
In dreams , Harry always walks purposefully along this room and proceeds immediately to the door opposite the entrance and steps forward . 
But here are about a dozen doors . 
As soon as he was staring at the door opposite him , trying to decide what was right , a terrible roar sounded and the candles began to move to one side . 
The round wall is rotating . 
Hermione clutched Harry's arm as if she were afraid the floor might move , but it was not . 
For a few seconds , the blue flames around them were as dim as the neon lights as the walls speeded up ; Then , suddenly , at the beginning , the sound stops and everything stands still . 
Harry's eyes were burned by blue stripes ; But that's all it can see . 
What is it for ? Ron whispered in panic . 
I thought it was so we could not tell what door we were going through , Ginny said in a silent voice . 
Harry immediately realized that she was right : to identify the door now as well as to locate an ant on the black floor ; and the door they must walk through may be any of the twelve . 
So how do we come out ? Neville said in a nervous tone . 
That's not the problem now , Harry says forcefully , blinking away the blue lines from sight , and keeping the wand tighter than ever , we will not have to go out until we find . as Sirius - 
Even so , do not go calling him ! Hermione pleaded ; But Harry did not need her advice , her instincts forcing him to keep as quiet as possible . 
Where are we going now , Harry ? Asked Ron . 
I did not ... " Harry started . 
It swallows . In my dreams I go through the door to the end of the corridor and into a dark room - this is the one here - and then I go through another door and into a room , a very ... brightly . 
We should try some of the doors , he said quickly , I will find the right way when I see it . let's go 
She went straight to the door that was now facing her , the others in the back , placing her left hand on the glowing cool surface of the door , holding her wand ready to strike as soon as the door opened . open , it pushed . 
The door opened easily . 
With the darkness of the first room , the low light gold chains hanging from the ceiling here give the impression that this triangular room is much brighter , although there is no shimmering light . , splendid and magnificent as Harry saw in his dream . 
This place was empty except for a few sets of tables and chairs , and a giant glass tank containing a mysterious blue liquid was placed in the middle of the room . The tank was large enough for all of them to swim in , Some white objects glittering like pearls are drifting in there . 
What is that ? Ron whispered . 
I do not know , Harry said . 
Are they fish ? Ginny gasped . 
Aquavirius Maggots ( Water Hole ) ! Luna said very excitedly . My father told me that the Department is breeding - 
No , Hermione said . 
Her voice seemed strange . 
She moved closer to look inside the tank . They are the brains . 
The brains ? 
Yes ... I wonder what they will do with them ? 
Harry joins her and approaches the aquarium . 
When it stands nearly like this , it can not be mistaken . 
Incredibly strange , strange objects drifted into view in the blue liquid , looked like mackerels of mucus . 
Get out of here , Harry said . 
This is not true , we need to try another . 
There are other doors , Ron just around the wall . 
Harry's heart stopped beating ; This room is so big ? 
In my dreams I go through a dark room and enter a second room , it says . 
I think we should go back and try again . 
They hurried back to the dark round room ; The ghostly image of the brains is now swimming in front of Harry's eyes instead of the candlelight's green flame . 
wait ! Hermione suddenly said as Luna was about to close the room containing the brains . 
Flagrate ! 
She waved the wand in the air and a burning X appeared on the door . 
As soon as the door closed , a loud crash resounded , and the wall once again swirled dizzily , but now there was a large reddish blur of streaks of blue and , when everything turned Quiet , cross marks still on fire , indicating the door they have passed . 
That's good , Harry said . Well , now we ' ll try this wing ... 
He strode to the opposite door and pushed open the door , the wand still rising high and the others near the heel . 
This room is larger than the first , fuzzy and triangular , not a circle , hollow in the middle , forming a rock tunnel about 20 feet deep . 
They were standing on the top of a row of rows of rocky chairs running around the room and running down the stairs as a lecture hall , or courtroom where Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot Council . 
Instead , instead of a chain chair , it was a rocky platform in the middle of the tunnel , setting up a rocky archway that looked so old , cracked and broken that Harry was so taken . Surprised by it still standing . 
There is no surrounding wall surrounding it , the gate is hung by a curtain , or a black , tattered screen , which , despite the cool silence of the cold air wrapped , still shaking very lightly as had been touched . 
Who's that ? Harry jumped to the bottom . 
There was no answer , but the veil continued to vibrate and rock . 
Careful ! Hermione whispered . 
Harry crawled down one row until it reached the bottom of the tunnel . 
Its footsteps echo as it slowly approaches the rocky platform . 
The sharpened gate looked much higher from where it was standing than before when viewed from above . 
The curtains gently swing , as if someone had crossed it . 
Sirius ? Harry called again , but he was less vocal as he was now nearer to it . 
It had a strange feeling that someone was standing behind the curtain , on the other side of the gate . 
Grabbing the wand , it wraps around the platform , but there is no one there ; All it can see is the other side of the tattered screen . 
Let's go , Hermione called from the middle steps . This is not true Harry , come on , let's go . 
Her voice sounded frightened , even more frightened in the room containing the swimming brains , though Harry thought the gate had something as beautiful , though it was old . 
The curtain ripples as it urges it ; Make it feel a very strong urge to climb up the platform and go through the gate . 
Harry , let's go , OK ? Hermione spoke more forcefully . 
OK , it says , but still does not move . 
He just heard something . 
There was a soft whisper , or a murmur from the other side of the curtain . 
What are you talking about ? he said , so loud , that the words echoed around the benches . 
No one is saying anything , Harry ! Said Hermione , now she was approaching it . 
Someone was whispering behind it , coming out of her reach and continuing to frown at the curtain . Is not you , Ron ? 
I'm here , Ron appears at the gate . 
Can anyone else hear them ? Harry demanded , as the whisper and muttering grew louder , though unintentionally , he found himself on the podium . 
You can also hear Luna panting , joining them at the gate and staring at the curtain shaking . Someone in it ! 
Speak in 
What do you mean ? Hermione jumped to the last step , demanding , and sounded much more angry than before , no one inside , it was just a gate , no room for anyone to be in . both . 
Harry , stop it , get out of there ... 
She grabbed Harry's hand and pulled , but it resisted . 
Harry , we're here because of Sirius ! she said , her tone strained . 
Sirius , recalled Harry , was still staring at the screen as he continued to move . 
Yeah ... 
Something finally slipped into place in his brain ; Sirius , was arrested , tied up and tormented , yet he was staring at the gate ... 
He took a few steps back from the platform and took his eyes off the curtain . 
Let's go , he said . 
That's what I'm still trying to do ... then , come on ! , Said Hermione , and she led the way around the platform . On the other side , Ginny and Neville , apparently fascinated , were staring at the curtain . 
Without saying anything , Hermione grabbed Ginny's arm , 
Ron took Neville's hand , and they resolutely forced them back into the lowest seat and climbed onto the door . 
What do you think that gate is ? Harry asked Hermione as they returned to the dark round room . 
I do not know , but whatever it is , it's dangerous , " she said firmly , engraving a cross on the door . 
Again , the wall turns and then quiet again . 
Harry picked up another door , approached and pushed . 
It does not move . 
What's up ? Said Hermione . 
It's locked ... Harry said , rush to use his body to break the door , but the door does not even budge . 
Well , this is it , is not it ? Ron joined in with Harry and tried to open the door . Definitely it ! 
Get away ! Hermione interrupted . 
She pointed the wand to the side that would put the lock on a normal door and read the mantra , Alohomora ! 
No matter what happens . 
Sirius's knife ! Said Harry . 
He pulled the knife out of his cloak and slid into the crack between the door and the wall . 
The rest of the crowd watched as they pulled the knife down from above , then pulled out the knife and pushed the shoulder to the door . 
The door is still hardened as usual . 
Yet another thing , when Harry looked down at the knife , he noticed the blade was melting . 
So let's leave this room , Hermione assures . 
But what is it like ? Said Ron , looking at the door with a fearsome sensation of agitation . 
No way , Harry could go through every door of his dream , Hermione said , continuing to mark the door with another seal while Harry removed the handle from Sirius's knife , now Now completely useless , in the bag . 
Do you know that there may be something in it ? Luna said excitedly , as soon as the wall started spinning again . 
Something is upset , absolutely no doubt , Hermione said while breathing , and Neville smiled a little worriedly . 
The wall stopped and Harry , with increasing despair , pushed open the next door . 
This is it . 
He knew it immediately because of the beautiful lights , dancing and sparkling like diamonds . 
As Harry's eyes became accustomed to the glare of light , he saw the timepieces shining with light from all sides , large and small , standing in the space between the bookshelves or standing on the books . The desk lined the length of the room , so a tick ticked busy and pervaded the room like thousands of tiny military marches . 
The origin of the dancing diamond light was from a crystal pyramid standing at the far end of the room . 
this way ! 
Harry's heart leapt wildly because he now knew they were on the right track ; It leads down the narrow space between the chairs , leading , like in dreams , to the head of the light source , the same high - pitched crystal bell set on a table , in is a swirling whirlpool and sparkle . 
Look ! Ginny said as they approached , she pointed at the very center of the bell . 
Drifting along the inner airflow is a small egg , gleaming like a gem . 
When raised in the jar , it breaks and a hawk emerges , the bird is taken to the top of the jar , but falls down so its hair is dirty and wet , and right at the bottom of the jar . The bird is again surrounded by eggshell . 
go ahead Harry said suddenly , because Ginny had wanted to stop and see the bird's return to the egg . 
You wasted your time by that old gate ! she protested , but also followed it through the bell to reach the only door behind them . 
Here it is , Harry said again , and his heart was beating so hard it felt that it was blocking his words , going through it ... 
He glanced at his friends ; They pulled out the wand and suddenly had a very serious and worried expression . 
He looked back toward the door and pushed . 
The door is open . 
They were there , they found it : as high as a church and filled with bookshelves like towers filled with small and dusty glass spheres . 
The images of them flutter in the light that comes from the many candles placed at a distance along the bookshelves . 
Like the dark round room just now , the fire here is blue . 
The room was very cold . 
Harry stepped forward and peered down one of the fading passages between the two bookshelves . 
It does not hear any sound nor does it see even a slight sign of movement . 
He said it was number 97 , Hermione whispered . 
Oh , Harry gasped , looking up at the nearest row . 
Underneath the candle holder is the green sparks jutting out some 53 of silver . 
We need to go now , I think , Hermione whispered , glancing to the next row . that's number 54 . 
Ready wand , Harry whispered . 
They crept forward , glancing back as they walked down the narrow and narrow passage of the bookcase , far away from the almost completely dark path . 
Small , gold - plated labels are placed below each glass sphere on the shelf . 
Some of them contain a strange liquid glowing ; Others are dim and dark like candles . 
They go through the number ... 
85 ... 
Harry tried to listen to the slightest sound of movement , but now Sirius could be silenced , either unconscious or unconscious . rang in his head , he may have died ... 
If that's how it feels , it tells itself , its heart is against the throat , I must know ... 
97 ! Hermione whispered . 
They stood around the corner at the end of the bookshelves , staring down the aisle . 
There is no one there . 
He was at the very end , Harry said , his mouth was dry . You can not see exactly from here . 
And it led the way among the glass bridges as tall as the tower , a few glowing as they passed by . 
He must be around here , Harry whispered , telling himself that every move would bring Sirius's ragged tones on the dark floor into view . " Anywhere around here ... very close ... 
Harry ? Hermione suggested , but she did not want to respond . 
Its mouth is very dry . 
Somewhere ... in the range ... this it says . 
They have reached the end of the line , where the candles are even blurred . 
There is no one here . 
All is just vague silence . 
He can ... Harry whispered in a hoarse voice , looking carefully at the side walk . Or maybe ... It hurries down the aisle next to that . 
Harry ? Said Hermione . 
What ? He growled . 
I do not think Sirius is here . 
No one said anything . 
Harry did not want to look at either of them . 
He felt sick . 
He does not understand why Sirius is not here . 
He must be here This is where it , Harry , saw his uncle . 
He ran to the empty space at the end of the line , looking down at them . 
Pass through empty bookshelves found lined consecutive . 
She ran in another way , crossing back to the people who were staring at her . 
There are no signs of Sirius around here , nor are there any traces of a struggle . 
Harry ? Ron called . 
What ? 
He did not want to hear what Ron had to say ; Do not want to hear Ron say he's a fool and suggest that they have to go back to Hogwarts , his face is hot and it feels like he's hiding here , in the dark a long time ago When faced with the light of the entrance gate and the guilty look of the rest ... 
Have you ever seen this ? Ron said , 
What ? Asked Harry , but this time excitedly - it must have been a sign of Sirius ' presence there , a clue . 
He strode to the side of the group on a small street down the ridge number 97 , but found nothing but Ron looking at a dusty glass globe on the shelf . 
What is this ? Harry said sadly . 
It's ... it's your name on it , Ron said . 
Harry approached a little closer . 
Ron is pointing at one of the tiny glass spheres glowing with a dim light inside , though it is extremely dusty and appears to have been untouched for years . 
Name me ? Harry stood there blankly . 
He stepped forward . 
Not as tall as Ron , he had to dig his neck to read the yellow label firmly attached to the bookshelf just below the dirty glass sphere . 
The writing was sure to have been completed one day about 16 years ago , and at the bottom : 
S . P . T is A . P . W . B . D 
Dark Lord and ( ? ) Harry Potter 
Harry stared at the object . 
what is that ? Asked Ron , seemingly lost courage . Why is your name on it ? 
He glanced at the other labels on the same shelf . 
I'm not here , he said , his voice flaccid . None of us are here . 
HARRY , I do not think you should touch that , Hermione said suddenly , as she reached out her hand . 
Why not ? it says . 
That's something about me , right ? 
No , Harry , Neville said right away . 
Harry looked at him . 
Neville's plump face is now sweating . 
It looks like you can not delay this anymore . 
My name is on it , said Harry . 
A little sense of desperation , it closed his finger around the dusty surface . 
It waits for a cold feeling from the globe , but no . 
On the contrary , it seems that the ball was in the light for an hour , or that the light inside had warmed it . 
Waiting , even hoping , is something tragic to happen , something exciting will make this long and dangerous journey of theirs finally worthwhile , Harry lifted the fruit . Remove the glass from the shelf and stare . 
No event occurred . 
The rest of the people moved closer to Harry , eyes glued to the globe as it swept away the dirt that was blocking the surface of the globe . 
And then , from behind them , a stern voice came up . 
Very good , Potter . 
Now go back , touch and be obedient , and give it to me . 
CHAPTER 35 : BEYOND CHEESE 
Black shadows appeared in thin air around them , blocking the two sides ; the eyes flashed through the gap of the headgear and a dozen wands pointing at them ; Ginny gasped for fear . 
Follow me , Potter , Lucius Malfoy's repetitive voice . 
In Harry's heart was disappointed . 
They were surrounded by twice as many enemies . 
Follow me , Malfoy voice again 
Where is Sirius ? Asked Harry 
Some Death Eaters laugh big ; a raucous female voice rang out from the middle of Harry's triumphal image : the Dark Lord always knew ! 
Always , Malfoy's voice echoed . Right now , give me the sphere of prophecy , Potter 
Where do I want to know Sirius ? 
Where do I want to know Sirius ? the female voice on the left parodied it . 
It seemed that she and the Death Eaters were only a few feet from Harry , the light from their wands blowing Harry's eyes . 
We arrested him , Harry said in a panic , the terror that it has struggled since they entered the 97 th . I know he is here . 
He was awakened and was looking for what he dreamed , a female voice that imitated the child's voice very uncomfortably . 
Harry felt Ron moving beside him . 
Do not do anything , Harry whispered , Nothing 
The woman who mimicked Harry's voice grinned . 
Did you hear it ? 
Let's say that to all those who intend to fight us 
Bellatrix , you do not know Potter by me . 
He is a weak hero , the Dark Lord knows all about it . 
Come on , give me the sphere of prophecy , Potter , Malfoy's voice . 
I know Sirius is here . 
I know the floods you took him , Harry said , though the bewilderment made him feel choking . 
The Death Eaters laughed and laughed the loudest of them . 
This is the time to know the difference between real life and dreams . Give me a sphere of prophecy or we ' ll use the magic wand , says Malfoy . 
On the ! , Said Harry , and lifted his wand to his chest . 
Immediately , Ron's wand , Hermione , Neville , Ginny and Luna around it also light up . 
Harry's stomach tightened , if Sirius really was not here , he would have left his friends , despite their death , for no reason . 
But Death Eaters do not attack . 
Let go of the prophecy and no one will get hurt , says Malfoy coldly . 
Harry laughed . Oh yes , I give some prophetical spheres and some people will let us go home right ? Said Harry . 
Words get out of his mouth when a female Death Eater screams : ACCTO PROPH - 
Harry is ready to deal with her . 
He screams PROTEGO ! before she finished talking and although the glass sphere slipped off her fingers it kept it . 
Oh , you know how to play , little Potter , she said as her crazy eyes staring at the gap of her hat . Very good , then - 
I SAID THAT I AM NOTHING ! Lucius Malfoy screamed to the woman . If you break it ... ! 
The thoughts in Harry's mind were very fast . 
The Death Eaters want this meaningless glass sphere and it has no interest in it . 
It just wants to be alive , it wants to make sure that no one of her friends pays a price for their stupid ... 
The woman stepped forward , stepped away from her members and pulled out the towel . 
Bishop Azkaban has a dull , sloppy face and looks like a skull of Bellatrix Lestrange but still carries with it a restlessness and ruddy complexion . 
You need more convincing , huh ? She said , her breasts bulging and collapsing quickly . Very good - grab the smallest child She turned to Death Eater beside : Let it look while we take care of the little girl . 
I will treat it 
Harry felt that the others were very close to Ginny , and he walked several steps to the side so that he could stand in front of Ginny , the prophetic ball held in his chest . 
You'd have to break it if you wanted to attack any of us . She told Bellatrix . 
I do not think your boss is happy if you come back without it , right ? 
She stood still , staring at it , her tongue licking her thin lips . 
So ... Harry said : Anyway ... what are we talking about ? 
He did not think about what to do but kept talking . 
Neville's arms clutched on it and it could feel him wobbling ; and someone else behind him was breathing hard . 
He hoped they could find a way out of this place because his mind was not able to think at all . 
What is the prophecy ? Bellatrix repeated , teeth bared from her face . joke , Harry Potter 
No , no kidding , Harry said , his eyes flickered through each Death Eater to find their weakness , a gap through which they could escape . How does Voldemort want it ? 
Some of the Death Eaters hissed angrily . 
Do you dare to call him ? Bellatrix whispered . 
That's right , Harry said while holding the crystal globe to prevent others from getting it . 
Yes , I do not have a problem speaking Vol - 
Shut up Bellatrix shrieked . You dare say your name with your shabby lips , you dare to smear it with your tongue ' mudblood ' , you dare ... 
" Well , do you know he's also a ' mudblood ' ? " Harry said despairingly . 
Hermione also spoke softly : Voldemort , his mother was a witch , and his father was a Muggle , or did he say he was a pureblood ? 
' STL / PEF - ' 
' ARE NOT ' 
A red light flashes from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand , but Malfoy deflects it ; its mantra caused her light to hit the ground just to the left of Harry and to cause some glass spheres to shatter . 
The two shapes are white as ghosts move like smoke , their shadows appear from the broken glass on the floor and they begin to speak ; their voices are confused with other voices ; So there are only a few sentences that can be heard with the screams of Malfoy and Bellatrix . 
' The new time will come ' the appearance of a bearded old man . 
DO NOT TURN IT ! WE NEED TO SPEED FORWARD 
She dares to challenge , it dares to challenge Bellatrix to scream discursively . It stands here , dirty mud blood 
PLEASE BEFORE WE HAVE ANYTHING TODAY , Malfoy said loudly . 
... 
and no one can continue ... 
, the young man shouted 
Two shapes appeared from broken glass melted into the air . 
Nothing but the broken glass on the floor reminiscent of their presence . 
They have disappeared but this makes Harry come to mind but the problem is how to communicate it to others . 
" You did not tell me the prophetic spade I was about to throw away was special , " Harry said to prolong his time . 
It moves slowly across the lap , looking for other people around . 
Do not make fun of us , Potter , Malfoy said 
I did not do anything , Harry said , half his mind to the talk , the other half to focus on the move . 
And when it detects someone's toes , it stomps on it . 
A sudden breath behind her told him that the toes were Hermione's . 
What ? she whispered 
Has Dumbledore ever told you why you have a scar hidden in the Depot ? Malfoy teased 
I ... what ? Said Harry , and for a moment he completely forgot his plans . What's my scar ? 
What ? Hermione whispered urgently over it 
can this be ? Malfoy's voice was grateful ; Some Death Eaters continue to laugh . 
Taking advantage of their laughter , Harry whispered to Hermione , trying to get his lips to the least , breaking the drawers . 
Dumbledore did not tell you ? Malfoy repeated . This explains why you did not come earlier , Potter , the Dark Lord wondered why ... 
- when I say ' now ' - 
... You do not run until you point it to where it was hiding through your dreams . 
You think curiosity can make you want to know exactly where it is ... 
" Did he do that ? " Said Harry . 
It is more perceptive than hearing Hermione replaying her message to others and it should continue to speak to distract the Death Eaters . Why did he want me to come and get it ? 
Why ? Malfoy said with suspicion . Because people were only allowed to take their own prophetic spheres out of the Department of Confidentiality , Potter , the Dark Lord discovered this when he tried to use someone else to steal him . 
Why would he want to steal a prophecy from me ? 
For both , Potter , both he and you ... have you ever wondered why the Dark Lord was trying to kill you when you were a kid ? 
Harry stared at the crevasse of the eyes through which Malfoy's gray eyes were emitting a flash of light . 
Does the prophecy cause the death of its parent , which causes it to carry a lightning scar ? 
Is the answer to all these problems lying on its hands ? 
Has anyone made the orphaned sphere about Voldemort and me ? he whispered , and staring at Lucius Malfoy , his fingers tightening over the glass sphere in his hand . 
The ball is bigger than the Snitch ball and still full of dirt . And he drove me to get him ? 
Why did not he come and get it ? 
Get it yourself ? Ballatrix exclaimed , chuckling wildly . The Dark Lord came to the Ministry of Magic , when they had the honor to ignore his return ? 
The Dark Lord , who is going to reveal himself to the gods while the flood is still wasting time with my dear cousin ? " 
So he wanted me to do that dirty job for him . 
Said Harry . It's like he used Sturgis to steal it , and Bode .. 
Very good , Potter , very good ... 
Malfoy said slowly . But Dark Lord knows that you do not .... 
NOW , screamed Harry 
Five different voices behind it screaming REDUCTO ! . 
Five curses fly in five different directions and the opposite chambers detonate when they hit the target ; The tower shifts to one side as hundreds of glass spheres explode , the white shadows appear in the air and float there , the sound of which echoes from those who know that death has passed from the middle of the stream . of broken glass and pieces of wood falling on the floor . 
RUN ! , Harry screamed as the cupboards swayed uncertainly and the glass spheres began to fall . 
He grabbed Hermione's cloak and pulled her forward , one of her hands covered her head to avoid the low shelves and hundreds of broken glass shattered . 
A Death Eater rushes forward through the dirt cloud but Harry pushes his elbow in his face ; They cried out as the fragments of rumbling chests poured down on their heads , the cry of the prophets breaking out of their orbs . 
Harry finds a safe exit and sees Ron , Ginny , and Luna running at full speed behind him ; Their arms covered their heads , occasionally , a heavy object hit one side of the face but it just bent its head and continued to sprint ; An arm grabbed his shoulder but he heard Hermione cringe : STUPEFY ! and the arm dropped it off immediately . 
They were at the end of row 97 ; Harry turned right and sprinted ; He could hear the footsteps in the back of her right , and Hermione's voice was urging Neville ; She ran straight ahead through the door they had been in ; Harry could see the glittering light of the bellowing bell ; It ran all the way through the door , the prophecy ball was held securely in her hand and waited until the others crossed the threshold and slammed the door behind them . 
Colloportus ! Hermione said as she gasped and the door closed with an oddly silent sound . 
Where are the others ? Asked Harry 
He thought that Ron , Luna and Ginny were in the front , that they were waiting in this room but no one was here . 
They must have lost their way ! Hermione was scared , the terror still on her face . 
Listen ! Neville whispered 
The footsteps and sounds echoed from behind the closed doors ; Harry pressed his ear to the door and heard Lucius Malfoy yell , Leaving out Nott , putting it away - injuring him did not make sense nor could it compare to losing the prophecy . 
Jugson , come back , we need to reorganize ! 
We will split into pairs and search ; And do not forget to be polite to Potter until we get the prophecy , you can kill others if you need them ; Bellatrix , Rodolphus goes left ; Crabbe , Rabastan , to the right - Jogson , Dolohov go straight to the front door - Macnair and Avery through this side - Rookwood , over there - Mulciber , follow me ! 
What we will do ? Harmione asked Harry in awe , 
We will not stand here waiting for them to find us . Harry , stay away from this door . 
They tried to run silently , through the loud bell , where the small egg was hatched and toward the round door to the far end of the hall . As close to it , Harry heard something . It was banging on the door that Harmione had closed . 
Avoid the side ! a voice said , Alahomora ! 
Harry , Hermione and Neville crawled under the table as the door opened . 
They saw under the robe of two Death Eaters approaching ; They move very quickly . 
Maybe they ran straight into the hall , a loud voiced . 
Check the table , another voice said 
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters collapse ; He pointed his wand out from beneath the table and exclaimed : STUPEFY ! 
A flash of red light hits the nearest Death Eater , beating him back into a clock , but the second Death Eater jumps aside and points his wand at Hermione crawling out . under tables . 
AVADA - 
Harry dashed across the floor and grabbed Eragon's leg so that he could not stand and his hands were deflected . 
Neville threw down the table , pointing his wand toward the two struggling and screaming : 
' EXPELLIARMUS ! ' 
Harry's wand and the Death Eater slipped out of their hands and flew toward the lobby ; both cows on the ground to retrieve the wand , the Death Eater in front , Harry reptilian followed ; Neville stared at her husband , afraid of what she had just done . 
Stay away , Harry ! Neville yelled with the clear intention of correcting the mistake he made 
Harry rushed to the side as Neville raised his hand and shouted : ' STUPEFY ! ' 
A red light flashed straight through Death Eater's right shoulder and smashed into a glass drawer filled with different glass clocks on the front wall ; the shelf collapsed on the floor and exploded , the glass splashed all over , the intact shot on the wall and fall again shattered . 
The Death Eater was grabbing a wand and lying next to a bell on the ground . 
Harry leaned under another table as he turned ; He could not see because his mask was gone . 
He tear off the mask with his other hand and shout : STUP - 
STUPEFY ! , Cried Hermione . 
A red light struck the Death Eater's chest , causing him to freeze , his arms still rising , his magic wand to the floor giving a croaking sound and he collapsed towards the female . bell in the back . 
Harry thought he would fall into the pile of glass and push the bell on the floor backwards , but instead he fell on the table , his head sinking across the surface of the bell . 
Accio ! Exclaimed Hermione . . 
Harry's wand flew from the corner to her , she threw it to Harry . 
Thanks , Harry said , Come on , come out - 
Look ! Neville exclaimed in horror . 
He stared at the head of Death Eater in the bell . 
The three of them raised their wands but no one moved , they stared , their mouths frightened to see what was happening to his head . 
It was shrinking rapidly and progressively , beards and black hair huddled inside his skull ; His cheeks are smooth , rounded and rounded and covered with a feather ... 
A child's head grows oddly in the middle of Death Eaters ' neck as he struggles to start over ; but even when they look , the mouth is open , the head starts to grow in its former place ; black hair grows from head and chin ... 
It's Time , says Hermione in Terror , Time ... 
Death Eater shook his ugly head , trying to clean it but before he could pull his head off it started back to childhood again . 
There was a sound screaming from a nearby room , followed by a crash and a scream . 
RON ? Harry exclaimed and woke up to the strange change in their eyes . GINNY ? LUNA ? 
Harry ! Cried Hermione . 
Death Eater has pulled his head out of the bell . 
He appeared in a strange form , his tiny baby head said loudly , his rigid arm raised up in all directions in a dangerous way , nearly hit him just bent down quickly to avoid . 
Harry lifted his body but was surprised to see Hermione holding his hand . 
You can make a baby hurt ! 
With no time to debate this , Harry could hear footsteps coming from the hall and knew it was too late ; to leave this place quickly . 
let's go ! he said and left the eerie little child of Death Eater to surprise them behind them , and they headed for the door leading to the dark hallway that had opened at the other end of the room . 
Once halfway , Harry looked through the open door and saw two more Death Eaters running across the dark room toward them ; Turning left , he suddenly turned into a dark , messy room and slammed the door behind them . 
COLLO - , Hermione started but before she could finish reading , the door was broken and the Death Eaters rushed inside . 
With a excited sound , both exclaimed : ' IMPEDIMENTA ! ' 
Harry , Hermione and Neville were beaten backward , Neville was knocked over the table and could not see , Hermione was bumped into a bookcase and immediately hit by heavy books ; Harry's head banged against the stone wall behind him , the small light that appeared before his eyes made him dizzy for a moment . 
We caught it ! a Death Eater standing near Harry exclaimed , In an office - 
SILENCIO ! , Hermione cried and the Death Eater's voice died out . 
He continued to speak through the openings on the mask but no sound came out . 
He was pushed aside by the second Death Eater . 
PETRIFICUS TOTALUS ! , Harry screamed when the second Death Eater lifted his wand . 
His hands and feet are locked together and he falls forward , smashing his face into the carpet at Harry's feet , stiff as a boat and unable to move . 
Well done , Ha - 
But Death Eater , whom Hermione had just dumbfounded , suddenly made an extraordinary move with his wand ; a purple flame that hit Hermione's chest . 
She cried out in amazement and collapsed to the floor . 
HERMIONE ! 
Harry knelt down beside her as Neville was trying to shuffle toward her from beneath the table , the wand held in front of him . 
The Death Eater kicked Neville's head as it appeared , kicking Neville's wand into a twist and hit him . 
Neville cried painfully and backed away , covering his mouth and nose . 
Harry looked around , his wand rising high and he saw the Death Eater ripping his mask and pointing his wand at Harry , and he recognized the long , pale and distorted face . From the Daily Prophet : Antonin Dolohov , the sorcerer killed Prewett . 
Dolohov grinned , with his free arm , pointing at the spherical sphere still held in Harry's hands , at him , and then at Hermione . 
Although he could not speak , his intent was clear . Give him the orb or it will be like her ... 
" If you do not kill us , I ' ll give it to you , " said Harry . 
A panicked thought made Harry unable to think properly ; She placed a hand on Hermione's warm shoulders , watching her anxiously : Do not let her die , do not let her die , that is her fault if she died . 
What are you doing , Harry Neville's voice from under the table , arms down to reveal the broken nose and blood flowing down from his mouth and say : do not give it to him ! 
Then there was a noise outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder : the child - the Death Eater's head appeared at the door , the head said loudly , his fist still beating Control of everything around him . 
Harry grabbed this opportunity : 
' PETRIFICUS TOTALUS ! ' 
The mage hits Dolohov before he can stop it and he pours the object forward on his teammates , both of them stiff like boats and can not move at all . 
Hermione tells Harry and holds her as the childish head of Death Eater is still groping around . Hermione , woke up again ... 
What did he do to her ? Neville said as he trudged out under the table and knelt down the side of the little girl , blood still flowing from the swollen nose of her nose . 
I do not know ... 
Neville grabbed Hermione's wrist 
Still beating , Harry , I'm sure 
As a wave of sadness melts that he has acted out of thoughts , Harry says : 
Is she alive ? 
Oh , I think so 
There was a waiting period when Harry listened to the sound of footsteps but all he could hear was the cries and groans of the child's death head in the next room . 
Neville , we're not far from the exit , Harry whispered , We're going to the round room . 
If we can let you go out there and find the right door before any Death Eater arrives , I bet you can take Hermione into the hallway and into the ladder ... Then you can find someone ... and alarm ... 
What would you do ? Neville said , his nose wrinkled and was not content with Harry . 
I'm going to look for other people , Harry said 
I ' ll go find them with him , Neville said firmly 
But Hermione - 
We will take him with us , Neville said , I will take him to fight better than me . 
He got up and grabbed one of Hermione's arms , furiously stared at Harry , then grabbed the other and took Hermione's exaggerated body over his shoulder . 
Wait , Harry said , he held Hermione's wand and put it in Neville's hand , Better off holding this . 
Neville threw half of the broken wand and they moved slowly toward the door . 
My grandfather would kill me . Neville said , blood dripping down from the nose as it spoke , it was my grandfather's wand . 
Harry stuck his head out the door and looked around carefully . 
The head of the Death Eater is still screaming and smashing objects , spilling the ancient clock , toppling the table , 
It blurs and disturbs everything , while the inner shell , like the glass that Harry now presumes contains the Turning Time , continues to fall , shatter and self - recover on the back wall . 
He will not pay attention to us where it whispers , go , remember to go right behind you ... 
They went out of the office and went back to the door to the dark corridor that seemed now completely deserted . 
They stepped forward , Neville stepping to the side of Hermione's weight ; the door of the room The time wobbled behind them and the walls began to spin . 
The winds blowing in Harry's head from behind seemed to make it unsteady ; She looked around until the walls were no longer moving . 
Harry saw Hermione's fire cross blurring on the doors . 
Which way will we go 
But before they can decide which way to go , a door on the right opens and three people come out . 
Ron ! Harry exclaimed and walked quickly towards them . Ginny - are you there ? 
Harry , Ron said and laughed softly , staggered forward , grabbed Harry's robes in front of him and looked at Harry with distracted eyes : He was here , haha ​​ ha so enlightened , ... 
Harry , you look so beautiful ... 
Ron's face was white and a dark substance was coming down from the corner of his mouth . 
Then his knees collapsed but he still clutched Harry's cloak as Harry's body was pulled down like a curved arch . 
Ginny ? Harry asked fearfully , What happened ? 
But Ginny shook her head , gasping and holding her ankles . 
I think she broke her ankle , I heard something break . Luna whispered , leaning down to Ginny . 
She seemed to be the only one who did not hurt . 
Four Death Eaters chased us in a dark room full of planets , it was a deserted place , sometimes they floated in the dark . 
Harry , we saw Uranus very close , Ron said and still laughing weakly . Know not , Harry ? We saw Uranus - ha ha ha - 
A bloody bubble appears at Ron's mouth and shattered . 
Moreover , one of them grabbed Ginny's leg , and used the " Curse of Enemy " and hit him with a fire . 
Luna gestures desperately to Ginny , her breathing seeming weak , her eyes still closed . 
What about Ron ? Harry asked as Ron continued to giggle , his hands still clutching Harry's cloak . 
I do not know if they hit him with something Luna sadly said but he became different , he was very hard to pull him along 
Harry Ron said and pulled Harry's ear closer to his mouth and still laughed weakly , who knew this girl was Harry ? 
She's Loony ... 
Loony Lovegood .... ha ha ha " 
We have to leave here , Harry said , Luna , can you help Ginny ? 
as Luna said , put the wand behind her ear and wrap one arm around Ginny's waist pulling her up . 
Just ankle , I can do it myself , Ginny said impatiently , but soon after , she fell to one side and grabbed Luna to stand . 
Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder like a few months ago as he pulled Dudley's hand . 
It looked around : they had only one twelve chance to find the right door out in the first . 
He pulled Ron toward the door ; They were just a few feet from the door when another door in the hall burst open and three Death Eaters entered , led by Bellatrix Lestrange . 
They are here ! She shouted . 
The Stunning Spell spells shot across the room , and Harry succeeded in getting past the front door , which pushed Ron out and leaned back to help Neville with Hermione , who passed the threshold just as Bellatrix crashed . hit the door . 
COLLOPORTUS ! , Harry cried and heard three bodies bumping into the other side of the door . 
No problem ! a male voice raised . Another way to get in - We've got them , They're here ! 
Harry looked around , they had returned to the Central Room and there were definitely doors around the walls . 
He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them and there were many more Death Eaters running to join the first group . 
' Luna - Neville - help me ! ' 
The three walked around the room , closing the doors they had come in , Harry crashing into a table and rolling over the table in the rush to the next door . 
' colloportus ! " 
There were footsteps along the back of the doors , for a moment a rather heavy body hit back , the door creaking and vibrating ; Luna and Neville spit the doors at the opposite wall , then when Harry reached the top of the room , he heard Luna cry out : 
' Colloaaaaaaaaargh ' 
She returned at the sight of the girl flying through the air ; Death Eater is entering the room through the door she did not arrive at the right time ; Luna hits a table , slips over the table to the floor and stays motionless like Hermione . 
Get Potter ! Bellatrix screamed and ran to her ; she dodged her and sprinted back to the room ; It was safe as long as they thought they could break the sphere of prophecy . 
Hey ! Ron said with a laugh as he staggered on his feet and wobbled like a drunkard on Harry's side , Harry , there are brains here , ha ha ha , is that strange Harry ? 
Ron avoided , lying down - 
But Ron pointed his wand at the tank . 
Harry , darling , these are the brains , look , ACCIO BRAIN ! 
The movement of things seems to freeze . 
Harry , Ginny , and Neville and the Death Eaters turn around to look at the top of the tank when a brain suddenly appears from a blue liquid like a swimming fish : for a moment everything seems to stop . again ; Then it flew toward Ron , spinning and looking like a moving ribbon and making shapes , splitting and rolling in like a movie - 
Ha ha ha , Harry , look at that , Ron said and looked at it spewing out the parts inside , Harry , come and move on them , I bet it's very weird - 
' RON , NO ! ' 
Harry did not know what would have happened if Ron had touched the tentacles of the thoughts flying below , but he was sure it would not be a good thing . 
It rushed forward but Ron touched his brain with his arms . 
As they touched his skin , the tentacles began to wrap Ron's arms like a cloak . 
Harry , look what happened this - no , no , I do not like it , no , stop , stop 
But small ribbons continue to wrap around Ron's chest , it tugged and pulled them away as the brain stretched against it like the body of an octopus . 
Diffindo ! Harry exclaimed , trying to cut off the tentacles that were wrapped around Ron in his eyes but they were not broken . 
Ron gave up , completely defeated by the belts wrapped around him 
Harry , it will cause him to suffocate ! , Ginny cried as she remained motionless on the floor as she broke her ankle ; Then a flash of light from the wand of a Death Eater arrives and hits her face . 
She is knocked over to the other side and lies unconscious . 
' STUBEFY ! " Cried Neville , turning Hermione's wand into a circular pattern and waving toward the dying Death Eaters . STUBEFY , STUBEFY ! 
But nothing happened . 
A Death Eater shoots a Stunning Spell at Neville but it's a few inches away . 
Harry and Neville now have only two men against the Death Eaters , two of whom shot the same silver rays as arrows on them but slipped and left a hole on the side wall . after . 
Harry starts running and Bellatrix Lestrange chases it ; holding the spherical prophet on top of it , sprinting back to the room ; All it can think of now is do everything to attract the Death Eaters away from the others . 
This seemed to be effective , they chased after it , banging chairs and tables but not risking to hit it for fear of breaking the orb and it ran through the only door that was still open , the door that through which the Death Eaters have entered ; In his heart he prayed that Neville would stay with Ron and find a way to free him . 
It ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor disappear ... 
It falls on steep steps , from one level to the next , and the impact makes it impossible to breathe , its back lying down on a damp floor , where the dome door back . 
The entire room shook with the laughter of the Death Eaters , looked around and saw five of them in the central room coming down toward it while adding more names from other doors . approaching . 
Harry tried to stand up even though his legs were trembling badly and clearly they did not support him : the sphere of prophecy was not broken in his left hand , the wand was clenched in his right hand . 
She turned around , looking around but still keeping an eye on the Death Eaters . 
Its back leg touches a solid : it touches the pedestal of the arch . 
It jumps upwards over it . 
The Death Eaters watch it stunned . 
Some of them gasped . 
Dolohov is still in a bad state as a result of the Bond blundered , his wand pointing directly at Harry's face . 
Potter , your game is over . Lucius Malfoy shuddered and pulled the mask off , now obediently gave me the prophetic sphere . 
Let the others go , I will give it to him ! Harry it recklessly . 
Some Death Eaters laughed loudly . 
You're not in a negotiable position , Potter's Lucius Malfoy says , his pale face full of satisfaction . You look at us , we have 10 people and you are alone ... or even Dumbledore does not teach you count ? 
She is not alone ! a voice above their heads , She has me ! 
Harry's heart sank : Neville was stepping down the stone stairs toward them , Hermione's wand held firmly in his trembling arm . 
Neville - no - go back to Ron - 
' STUBEFY ! ' Neville exclaimed and pointed his wand at every Death Eater who was returning to STUBEFY ! 
STL / BE - 
One of the greatest Death Eaters grabbed Neville from behind , clutching his arms to one side . 
It struggled and resisted ; Some of the Death Eaters laugh . 
Longbottom is not it ? Lucius Malfoy , we have taken your family to death ... your death will not shock her . 
Longbottom ? Bellatrix repeated and a wicked smile hatched on her haggard face . Why , I was very happy to see your parents , boy . 
I hope you will too ! Neville exclaimed , and he saw that it was hard to resist the catchers who were standing around him , a Death Eater saying : " Someone make him unconscious ! 
No ... no ... no ... Bellatrix said . 
She was very emotional , in a state of agitation as she glanced at Harry , then back to Neville . No , let's see how long Longbottom can endure before it is broken like his parents ... unless Potter wants to give us the prophetic sphere . 
Do not give it to them ! Neville said , as he wrestled and resisted when Bellatrix pulled him and the man holding him close to him , his wand swinging . Give it to them , Harry ! 
Bellatrix swings his wand : Crude 
Neville exclaimed , his legs pulled up to his chest so that the Death Eater was holding it immediately dropping it to the floor . 
The Death Eater released it and lay on the floor , shrinking and screaming in pain . 
That's just a little enjoy ! Bellatrix raised her wand and Neville's screams stopped and it lay sobbing beneath her feet . 
She turned around and looked at Harry , Come on , Potter gave us the prophet's spade or you're going to look at his little friend slowly ! 
Harry did not think , there was no other choice . 
The prophet is warming up in his hand and it gives it up . 
Malfoy jumps forward to grab it . 
At that moment , two more doors above them opened and five more ran into the room : Sirius , Lupine , Moddy , Tonks and Kingsley . 
Malfoy returns to his wand , but Tonks hits a Stunning Spell spell on him . 
Harry did not wait for the situation they could meet , but he jumped off the platform . 
The Death Eaters are completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Society , who are at the top shooting down a curse on them as they jump step by step towards the lower floor . 
Through the body , and with a flash of light , Harry could see Neville crawling along . 
He dodged a flash of red light and rushed to Neville . 
Are you okay ? Harry said , another curse flickered to the first few inches . 
Ừ Neville said and tried to stand up . 
What about Ron ? 
I think she's fine - she's still fighting with her brain when she's gone - 
The midst of the explosion broke out because of a curse that left a hole in the hole , where Neville's hand stayed there a few seconds ago ; Both cows came out of there , suddenly a fat chubby hand came from somewhere , grabbed Harry's neck and pulled it straight up so that Harry's toes were not touching the ground . 
Give it to me , a voice echoing in his ear gives me a prophetic sphere - 
The man presses against Harry's windpipe , making it impossible to breathe . 
With his eyes fading , he saw Sirius fighting with a Death Eater about 10 feet away ; Kingsley is fighting with two at once ; Tonks is still halfway down the street , beating the curse down Bellatrix - no one seems to realize that Harry is about to die . 
He turned his wand at the man , but he did not have the strength to speak the spell and the free arm of the man groping toward the arm that Harry was holding the sphere of prophecy . 
' AARGH ! ' 
Neville appears from the attacking place unexpectedly , unable to read clearly the spell that pierced Hermione's wand into the eye socket of the Death Eaters mask . 
The Death Eater let go of Harry and howled in pain . 
Harry turned the wand around his face and said while panting : 
' STUPEFY ! ' 
The Death Eater flips over and the mask comes off ; It was Macnair , Buckbeak could have been killed , his eyes swollen with blood . 
Thank you ! Harry tells Neville and pulls him aside when Sirius and a Death Eater stumble through ; The duel was so fierce that their wands dimmed ; Then Harry stepped on something round , solid and it slipped . 
For a moment he thought he had broken the prophet's sphere but then he saw Moody's magical eye swirling away on the floor . 
The Prophet was lying beside him ; blood still flowing over his head , and the attacker was chasing after Harry and Neville : Dolohov , his grim face glistening with joy . 
' Tarantallegra ! he screamed , his wand pointing directly at Neville , and immediately made his legs jump wildly , unable to keep his balance and fall back to the floor . Come on , Potter 
He made a fussy move like the one used with Hermione at the time Harry screamed : ' Protege / ( Protect ! ) 
Harry felt something on his face like a dull blade ; The thrust hit it tilting to the side and it fell on Neville's convulsive legs but the protective spell limited the worst of the curse . 
Dolohov raised his wand : Accio proph - 
Sirius from moving around , pounding on Dolohov with his shoulder and pushing him to shoot elsewhere . 
The Prophet slipped out of Harry's fingertips but held it . 
At this time Sirius and Dolohov were dueling , their wand glowing like swords , flashing from their wand heads . 
Dolohov waved his chopsticks like he did to Harry and Hermione . 
Harry jumped and cried out : Petrificus Totalus ! ( Full paralysis ) . 
Again , Dolohov's hands and feet are locked together and he is facing forward , lying down with a loud crash down his back . 
Great ! Sirius cried , pressing Harry's head as the two Stunning curls flew toward them . I want you out ... 
They both fell down , a blue glow like an arrow shot down Sirius . 
Across the room , Harry saw Tonks fall down from the middle of the stone stairs , her limp body fell down the stairs and Bellatrix , with a triumphant smile , was running back to the battle . 
Harry , take the prophet's sphere , grab Neville and run ! Sirius screams and runs off to confront Bellatrix . 
Harry did not see what happened next : Kingsley was wobbling in the distance , fighting with a maskless face : Rookwood ; Another blue glow flew over Harry's head as it headed toward Neville - 
Can you stand ? he screamed in Neville's ear , Neville's legs still twitching and uncontrollable . Bracelets it through my neck - 
Fist up Neville Harry pulls him up - Neville's legs are moving in all directions , they do not follow him and from somewhere a man suddenly attacks them : both fall behind , Neville's legs still waving like an acrobatic artist , Harry raised his left hand to the air to keep the small glass sphere safe from breakage . 
The Prophet , Give Me the Prophet , Potter ! Lucius Malfoy's voice snarled in his ear and Harry and he felt Malfoy's wand poking hard in the middle of his ribs . 
No , leave me ... 
Neville - catch it ! 
Harry threw the orb across the room , Neville stretched out his arms and held the ball to his chest . 
Malfoy pointed his wand at Neville , but Harry thrust his magic wand over his shoulder and cried out : " Impedimenta ! ( Encumber ) 
Malfoy was taken care of . 
As Harry screamed again , he looked around and saw Malfoy thrown onto the pedestal on which Sirius and Bellatrix were fighting . 
Malfoy raised his wand at Harry and Neville but before he could even take a breath , Lupine jumped in the middle . 
Harry , call everyone around and go ! 
Harry grabbed Neville's shoulder and pulled his body to the first floor of the stone steps ; Neville's legs twitched and could not support his weight ; Harry struggled with all the power he had and they climbed to another level . 
A long curse hit Harry ; It crumbles and it falls to the level below . 
Neville fell to the floor , his legs still twitching and kicking , he stuffed the prophecy into his pocket . 
let's go ! Harry recklessly pulled on Neville's cloak . Try pressing down his leg . 
He again tried to pull and Neville's cloak was torn apart , the crystal ball fell out of his pocket and before anyone grabbed it a Neville's stumbling kick hit him , it flew away . 10 feet to the right of them and pounding on the tier below them . 
As both of them were staring at the place where the orb was broken , a terrible thing happened , a pearl - like shape with huge open eyes tinged with pink in the air , unnoticed by anyone . besides two people . 
Harry could see his mouth move but they could not hear what the prophecy said because of the crashes , screams and screams around them . 
The form does not say anymore and disappears into nothingness . 
Harry , sorry ! Neville cried , his face aching as the legs continued to falter . 
I'm sorry , Harry , I can not do it ... 
It's okay ! Harry said , try to stand up and go out ... 
Dubbledore ! Neville said , his sweaty face suddenly thrilling , staring at Harry's shoulder . 
What ? 
' DUBBLEDORE ! ' 
Harry turned to look at where Neville was staring . At the top of their head , in the doorway from the Central Room , Albus Dumbledore was standing , his wand on high , his face white and angry . 
Harry felt like there was a surge of electricity coming to every fiber in his body - they were safe . 
Dumbledore walked slowly down the stairs , through Neville and Harry standing motionless with no thought of moving . 
Dumbledore had descended to the last tier when the nearest Death Eaters realized he was there and shouted to the other names . 
A dead eagle runs , wagging like a monkey on the opposite stone stairs . 
Dumbledore's curse pulled him away as easily as he hooked him with an invisible cord . 
Only one pair still fights as one does not realize that there are newcomers . 
Harry saw Sirius bend over to avoid Bellatrix's red light and laugh at her : 
Come on , you can do better than that ! he exclaimed , his voice echoing around the room . 
A second red light struck the middle of his chest . 
Laughter was still on his face but his eyes were wide open due to shock . 
Harry let go of Neville even though he had no intention of doing so . 
He jumped down the stairs , grabbed the wand when Dumbledore did the same and turned to the platforms . 
It seems the time Sirius fell for centuries : his body curved into a bow as he fell behind the curtain hanging from the top of the porch . 
Harry saw the fear and amazement mixed in his godfather face , a handsome face as he fell through the door and disappeared behind the faces . 
These guys are shivering like before a big wind and falling behind . 
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's happy voice but knew that it meant nothing - Sirius had fallen over the archway , he would have appeared from another spot in a few seconds ... 
But Sirius did not appear again . 
" SIRIUS ! " Cried Harry . " Uncle SIRIUS ! " 
It came down to the floor , its breath withered and panting . 
Sirius must have been behind the curtain , it - Harry , would pull you back . 
But when it came to the ground , Lupine grabbed Harry's chest and held it . 
It can not be done , Harry 
Keep him , save him , he just fell down 
It's too late , Harry 
We can still keep him in the face of Harry's fierce struggle , but Lupine does not release it . 
We can not do anything , Harry , can not , he's gone . 
Chapter 36 : The Only One 
' He has not gone yet ! " Harry shouted . 
It does not believe in it ; it will not believe ; He still struggled out of Lupine with all the strength he had . 
Master Lupine does not understand ; someone hides behind the curtain ; Harry heard them whisper as he entered the room . 
Sirius is hiding , just escaping from everyone 
' SIRIUS ! " he cried out , " SIRIUS ! " 
" He can not go back , Harry , " Lupine said , his voice breaking as he tried to hold Harry . " He could not turn back , because he was - ' 
" GOD " " HELL ! " Harry snarled . " SIRIUS ! " 
There was movement around them , the unknown noise coming from where , the spark by the curse flashed . 
With Harry's meaningless noises , curses that did not hit their way through them did not cause any reaction , no sense except that Lupine should stop pretending to be Sirius Less than a foot behind the curtain - it will never appear again , will never shake its black hair and rush to the battle again . 
Lupine pulled Harry away from the platform . 
Harry , still staring at the archway , started to get angry because Sirius had made him wait that long . 
But somewhere in it began to realize that , even as it was still pounding away from him , Sirius never forced him to wait before . Sirius risked everything to see Harry , To help him if Sirius did not appear again from that archway when Harry screamed as if his life depended on it , the only logical explanation could only be I can not go back to him really can not ... 
Dumbledore put most of the Death Eaters in the middle of the room , and they seemed to be unable to move with the invisible ropes ; Moody - eyed Mama walked across the room to where Tonks was lying , and tried to wake her up ; Behind the platform there was still light flashing , screams and screams - Kingsley was changing Sirius to continue chasing Bellatrix . 
" Harry ? " 
Neville crawled down the stairs one to where Harry stood . 
Harry is no longer struggling with Lupine , though still holds onto his hands . 
" harry I'm sorry , " Neville said . 
Its legs are still dancing like mad no stop . " Is that dead man - is Sirius Black , a - your friend ? " 
Harry nodded . " Here , " said Lupine quietly , and pointed his wand at Neville's feet , he said , " Finite . " The curse was won : Neville's legs stretched out on the floor , still shaking . 
Lupine's pale face . 
" please - look for other people . 
Where are they , Neville ? " 
Lupine turned away from the archway as he spoke . 
The teacher said as if all the words hurt him . 
" They were behind , " Neville said . 
" A brain has tied up Ron but I think she's fine - and Hermione is still unconscious , but we feel she's still breathing ... " 
There was a loud bang and a scream from behind the platform . 
Harry saw Kingsley fall down on the floor and cried out : Bellatrix Lestrange had escaped and ran wildly as Dumbledore whipped backwards . 
He attacked her with a curse but she did it off ; She was halfway up the stairs . 
" Harry - no ! " Lupine yelled , but Harry released his arm at once when Lupine let loose his hand . 
" SIRIUS SUCKED ! " Harry roared . " I HAVE KILLED IT , I WILL KILL ! " 
And it escaped , jumping up the stairs ; Everyone screams in the back but it does not care . 
Bellatrix's form in the cloak is in front and the two are back in the room with their floating brains . 
She throws a curse at her shoulder . 
The tank was thrown up without air and water was thrown out . 
Harry is engulfed in a foul - smelling liquid in : the brains flutter toward him and begin to bind the colorful and long tentacles , but he yells , " Wingardium Leviosa ! " It dropped it into the air . 
As he slipped , he ran to his side ; He passed Luna , still moaning on the floor , crossing Ginny , she said , " Harry , what is that ? " , passing Ron , still giggling weakly , and through Hermione . still unconscious . 
He twisted the door open to the dark round room and saw Bellatrix disappear from one side of the room ; In front of her is a corridor leading to the elevator . 
She ran to her but she closed the door and the walls began to spin . 
Again , it was surrounded by green light coming from the rolling light . 
" Where is the exit ? " He desperately yelled , and the wall began to stop again . " Where are the outlets ? " The room seemed to be just waiting . 
The door behind it slid open and the corridor leading to the elevator stretched in front of it , illuminated by the torches and without a shadow . 
It starts running 
He could hear the elevator move in front ; It ran all the way up the aisle , turned around in the corner and punched the knob on the knob to call the ladder several times . 
The elevator shrieked dully and threw down slowly ; The iron cage opened and it jumped in , punching the button " Reception Room . " 
The door closed and it started going up 
She flew out of the elevator before the door opened completely and looked around . 
Bellatrix approached the telephone booth at the other end of the room , but she looked back as she ran all the way to her and sent another curse at him . 
It hides behind the Magic Water Fountain : the curse passes through it and hits the gold door at the other end of the Gate , causing it to ring up like a bell . 
No more steps . 
She stopped . 
It hides behind statues and hears . 
" Come here , come here , little Harry ! " She called with a mocking childish voice , her voice echoing in the shadowy wooden logs . 
" What do you chase me for , boy ? 
I think you are here to take revenge for my cousin ! 
" I will take revenge ! " Harry exclaimed , and there seemed to be dozens of other Harrys repeating I would take revenge ! 
I will revenge ! 
I will revenge ! resonating around the room 
" Aaaaaah , do you love him , little kid Potter ? " 
The hatred that he had never known before was present in Harry ; He came out from behind the nozzle and roared , " Crucio ! " 
Bellatrix shrieked . The curse fell on her legs , but she did not roll around and screamed in pain as Neville stood up , gasping for breath and no longer laughing . 
Harry hid behind the gold spray . 
The retaliation curse of the spear struck the door of a very handsome sorcerer , causing the head to fall and lie on the floor to two feet , making a long scratch on the wooden floor . 
" You never used the Unforgettable Word , boy ? " She shouted . 
She gave up a childish voice . 
" You need to want them , Potter ! 
You have to want to really make someone hurt - enjoy it - the main anger is no longer hurt me anymore - I ' ll show you how to do ? 
I will give you a lesson - " 
Harry ran down the side of the spray tank to the other side as she screamed , " Crucio ! " And she was forced to hobble back when the centaur's arm , in her bows , broke loose and fell to the floor . The house of the witch's head in gold is not far away . 
" Potter , you can not win me ! " She cried . 
She could hear the noise as she moved to the side , trying to get closer to her . 
It laps behind the statue away from her , hiding behind the centaur's legs , its head rising up to the elf's head . 
" I was and is the most loyal servant of the Dark Lord . 
I have learned the art of Darkness from you , and I know that powerful curses , you poor little boy , can never dream of accomplishing ... " 
" Stupefy ! " Exclaimed Harry . 
He circled around to where the goblin was standing , grinning at the witch who had no head now and prepared for the post - mortem as she turned her eyes around the fountain . 
She reacts so fast she does not have time to hide . 
" Protego ! " 
The red glow , the dreaded crescent of itself , bounces back . 
Harry crawls back out into the fountain and the goblin's ears shoot through the room . 
" Potter , I ' ll give you a chance ! " Bellatrix shouted . " Give me the prophecy - roll it to me now - and I can let you live ! " 
" You will have to kill me , because it's gone ! " Harry growled and when he screamed , the pain burned his forehead ; The scar becomes hot , and it feels a rage completely unrelated to its own anger . " And he ' ll know ! " Said Harry , with a mad laugh responding to Bellatrix's laughter . " Your beloved old Voldemort will know it's gone ! 
He will not be pleased with you , right ? " 
' What ? 
What do you say ? " She yelled , and for the first time there was a fear in her voice . 
" The prophet's ball broke when I tried to get Neville up the stairs ! 
What do you think Voldemort would say about it ? " 
Its scar ached and burned its pain , causing tears to flow 
" TO SAY ! " She growled , but she could hear the horrible sound behind that instant . 
" MI GOT IT , POTTER , AND MI WILL MAKE IT FOR YOU ! 
Accio prophecy ! ACCIO PROPHECY ! " ( Prophecy here - ND ) 
Harry laughed again because he knew the laughter would provoke her , the terrible pain on her forehead that made her think it might explode . 
He waved his hand from the back of the goblin with one ear , and shook off very quickly as she launched a beam of green light toward it . 
" There's nothing there ! " He yelled . " Nothing to report ! 
It broke and no one heard what it said , tell her master like that ! " 
" Not right ! " She screamed . " No , you're lying ! 
MAJOR , I HAVE GIVEN , I HAVE GIVEN - PLEASE BE PATIENT , " 
" Do not waste a moment ! " harry shouted , his eyes flashing , trying to resist the pain at the scar , now the pain was more terrible than ever . 
" He can not hear you here ! " 
" Can not you , Potter ? " A high , cold voice rang out . 
Harry opened his eyes . 
< From here is the translation of Duynd > 
A thin tall figure with a black hood , his face white and fierce like a snake , red eyes , two children are staring ... 
The Dark Lord Voldemort appeared in the middle of the room , his wand pointing to Harry as frozen , unable to move . 
So you broke my prophecy ? Voldemort gently stared at Harry with his brutal red eyes . No , Bella , it does not lie ... 
We see the sincerity in the useless soul ... months of preparation , months of effort ... and our Death Eaters let Harry Potter poke the wheel once again ... 
Bellatrix sobbed : Dear Master , I'm sorry , I do not know that , I was fighting with Black Labs ! She throws herself to Voldemort's feet as he approaches . 
Owner , who must know that ... 
Be silent , Bella , Voldemort's voice is dangerous . I will not count with you at this time . 
Do you think I have to go to the Ministry of Magic just to hear you ask for forgiveness ? 
But my master - he is here - he is downstairs - 
But Voldemort did not pay attention to acne . 
Little man : I have nothing to say to you , Potter . 
You bothered me so much , too long . AVADA KEDAVRA ! 
Harry did not even open his mouth to resist , his mind completely empty , his wand pointing to the floor uselessly . 
But suddenly the gold - headed magician on the fountain came alive , jumping off the pedestal between Harry and Voldemort . 
The curse just overtook the statue's chest as it raised his hand to protect Harry . 
What - ? Voldemort exclaimed and looked around . 
And he breathed , Dumbledore ! 
Harry looked behind him , his heart pounding . 
Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden door . 
Voldemort raised his wand and a glint of blue light shot straight at him , but he changed direction and disappeared into the robe that was spinning . 
Then , he suddenly appeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand toward the rest of the fountain . 
The remaining statues also come alive . 
The statue of the witch that ran to Bellatrix was screaming in the void at the statue's chest before it hit him and hit him on the floor . 
Meanwhile , the goblin and elf rushed to the fireplace and disappeared beside the water tank . 
The headless figure pushed Harry backward , avoiding the fight , as Dumbledore was taking advantage of Voldemort and stepped past the hippopotamus trotting around them . 
Dumbledore said calmly : It is foolish to come here tonight , Tom . 
The gods are on the way here - ( Tom - real name of Voldemort as a child : Tom Mavolor Riddle - ND ) 
At that time I left , and you will die ! Voldemort replied . 
He again shoots a murder curse at Dumbledore but slides , instead firing them at the guard's desk , causing it to burn . 
Dumbledore slightly waved the wand : the power of the spell coming from the wand made Harry , though covered by the statue , also felt the hair upside down as it flew over and at the same time Voldemort bled silver shield to deflect it . 
Her magic spell , whatever it may be , does not cause a specific damage to the shield , despite a resounding sound - a weird quizzical sound . 
Said Voldemort , his red eyes protruding on the shield : " Are not you going to kill me , Dumbledore ? . 
Higher than cruelty , right ? 
We all know that there are other ways to destroy a human being , Tom , Dumbledore is still calm , continues to walk towards Voldemort as if he is not afraid of anything , that nothing can stop him . walk in the room Simply taking your life does not satisfy me , I must admit it - 
There is nothing worse than death , Dumbledore ! Voldemort growled . 
You were completely wrong , Dumbledore was still approaching Voldemort and spoke very gently as if they were discussing something on the glass . 
Harry felt scared when he had to look at him , not defending himself , without a shield ; She wanted to scream aloud , but the headless figure kept it facing the wall , stopping its efforts to escape from behind . 
Indeed , the failure to know what is worse than death is always your greatest weakness . 
Another blue light flashes from behind the silver shield . 
This time the one - handed man dashes forward , and Dumbledore hits the trigger and shatters it into a hundred pieces , but before the debris hits the floor , Dumbledore holds up his wand and waves as though he's wandering . . 
A long fire burst from the end of the wand ; It wrapped around Voldemort , the shield and everything . 
For a moment , it seemed like he was 
Dumbledore won , but then the fire wire turned into a snake , he did not take Voldemort anymore and hissed violently and dashed on Dumbledore . 
Voldemort disappeared ; snake head up , prepare to attack - 
A fire flared up in the air above Dumbledore as soon as Voldemort appeared on the pedestal in the middle of the tank where the five statues were standing . 
Watch ! Harry yelled . 
But as soon as it screamed , a flash of blue flashed toward Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake reached out too - 
The phoenix fawkes flew down in front of Dumbledore , who opened his mouth to catch the whole of the beam and caught fire and fell to the floor . An ugly bird , wrinkled and unable to fly , appeared on the floor . 
At the same time , Dumbledore waved his wand into a long line - the snake was preparing to fly high up and disappear in the opaque smoke ; and the water in the tank suddenly rose to cover Voldemort like a molten glass cocoon . 
In a few seconds Voldemort's shape on the pedestal looked dim , face unclear , obviously struggling to get out of the stuffy water . 
Then he disappeared and the water came back down to the pool , spilling out onto the shimmering floor . 
Bellatrix yelled : OWNED ! . 
It must have ended , Voldemort had run away , Harry ran out of the statue protecting it , but Dumbledore said aloud : Stay there , Harry ! 
The first time he heard Dumbledore's voice threaten . 
Harry could not understand why : the room was completely empty , Bellatrix was still sobbing under the statue of the witch , and the phoenix Fawkes was weak on the floor - 
Harry's scar scarred in pain , he thought it was dead : the pain was beyond imagination , beyond his suffering - 
He fled but hid himself in the red - eyed creature , so fastened that he did not know what his body was and what the creature was like : they were so mixed up , bound by pain , and there is no way to get rid of it - 
Then the other creature spoke , using Harry's mouth to say , though in extreme pain he still noticed his jaw moving ... Kill me , Dumbledore ... 
The eyes fade and feel as if they are dying , his whole body screaming for release , Harry again sees the creature using his body again ... 
If death is nothing , Dumbledore , kill him ... 
Stop the pain , Harry thought ... let him kill us ... stop this , Dumbledore ... death is nothing compared to this ... 
And it will see Sirius again ... 
And when Harry's heart was filled with emotion , the creature that was clutching it suddenly loosened , the pain was gone ; Harry found himself lying face down on the floor , the glass was falling , it trembled as if lying on ice , not wood ... 
Then there was more voices , more voices than before ... 
Harry opened his eyes and saw his spectacles near the heel of the statue , losing his head to protect it , but now lying on his back on the floor , creaking and motionless . 
He put on his glasses , raised his head a little , and saw Dumbledore's bushy nose above him . 
Are you Harry ? Yes , Harry shook as hard as he could not keep his head naturally . I , Voldemort , where are they - what are they - 
The reception room was full of people ; The floor reflects the burning blue jade fire in all the fireplaces along one side of the wall ; and a batch of witches are appearing from there . 
As Dumbledore pulled him up , Harry saw the elf - shaped statuette of the elf and goblin leading Cornelius Fudge - who looked dumbfounded - came . 
He was there ! a witch wearing a red robe with a ponytail bellowing and pointing to a broken stone pillar on the other side of the room , where Bellatrix was locked up just minutes before . I saw him , Mr. Fudge , I swear it was the Know - Who - who - he - he grabbed the woman and shed it off ! 
I know , Williamson , I know , I see him too ! Mr. Fudge stammered , still wearing his nightgown and wearing an overcoat , panting as if he had just run a mile . 
Oh - right here - right here ! - in the Ministry of Magic ! - Oh my god - can not - my statement - how can that happen - ? 
If you're hard pressed to go down to the Department of Confidentiality downstairs , Cornelius , Dumbledore says - looks like he's satisfied that Harry is alright , and heads up to the newcomers who have identified him before ( some have raised their chopsticks . the others merely expressed surprise ; the elf and goblin applauded , and Fudge stammered so hard that the slippers walked away from his feet ) - he would see some names Death Eaters are in jail in the Death Chamber , are trapped in Trenches and are waiting to see what he will do with them . 
Dumbledore ! Mr. Fudge gasped with surprise . He - here - me - me - 
He gazed at the Light that he had brought and could not be more clear that he was screaming with all his strength , shooting him ! 
Cornelius , I am ready to fight with his people - and win again ! his voice was thunderous . But a few minutes ago he saw evidence , with his own eyes , that I had told him the truth a year ago . 
Lord Voldemort has returned , he has been tracing the wrong object for 12 months , and now is the time for him to listen to the truth ! 
I - no - okay - Fudge looks intimidated , looking around as if waiting for someone to tell him what to do . 
When no one else did , he said , " Very good - Dawlish ! 
Williamson ! Take down the Department of Confidentiality and consider there ... 
Dumbledore , you - you will have to tell me exactly - the Fountain of Friendship of the Friends of the Magic Society - what happened ? he groaned and looked around the floor , where only the remains of witches , wizards and centaurs were left . 
We can discuss it after I bring Harry back to Hogwarts , he said . 
Harry - Harry Potter ? " 
Mr. Fudge turned and stared at Harry who was standing next to the statue guarding it during the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort . 
It is here ? Fudge stared at Harry . Why - all these are ? 
I will explain all , when Harry back to school . Dumbledore recalled . 
He walked out of the aquarium to where the golden sorcerer was lying on the floor . 
Then he pointed his wand and whispered , Portus . 
The head glowed in a blue light and vibrated on the wooden floor for a few seconds , then it returned to its original state . 
Let's look at this here right now , Dumbledore ! Fudge said as Dumbledore bent down to pick up the witch's head and take it to Harry . You are not allowed to use the Lockout ! 
He could not do it in front of the Ministry , his grandfather , 
He faltered as Dumbledore looked at him in a powerful way through his half - moon glasses . 
He said he would instruct Dolores Umbridge to move out of Hogwarts , and he would order his gods to stop tracing my Mysterious Creature Teacher so he could return to work . 
I will give you .... 
I took a watch with 12 needles in my pocket for half an hour this evening , and then I thought we would be able to take a look at the most important things that happened here . 
Then , I need to return to my school . 
If you need more help from me , of course you can contact me at Hogwarts . 
Please address the Headmaster . 
Fudge rolled his eyes more than ever ; The mouth is wide open and the round face becomes redder than the shiny gray hair . 
I - he - 
Dumbledore turned his back . 
Take the Harbor Key , Harry . 
He raised his golden head and Harry put his hand on it , just wondering what it would do next or where it would go . 
I ' ll meet you in half an hour , Dumbledore whispered . 
two ... three 
Harry recognized the familiar feeling as if there was a hook in his navel that suddenly jerked back . 
The shiny wooden floor faded away at his feet ; The Atrium , Mr. Fudge and Dumbledore disappear and he finds himself flying very fast in the wind and color of the wind . 
CHAPTER 37 : GOOD LIFE 
Harry's feet touched the ground hard , his knees slightly buckling , the gold witch's head falling to the floor sounded a ' post ' . 
He looked around and found himself in Dumbledore's office . 
Everything seems to have been repaired and rearranged while the principal was absent . 
Sophisticated silver musical instruments rested neatly on the slim table , so the music played smoothly . 
Portraits of former Grandparents are dumbfounded inside the photo frame , head resting on the chair or leaning against the edge of the picture . 
Harry stared out the window . 
A dull green line at the horizon : dawn is coming . 
The silence and tranquility , only occasionally broken by the snarls or grunts from the portraits , made it unbearable . 
If anything around it can reflect the feeling in it , the paintings must scream in pain . 
He walked around in a quiet , quiet office , trying not to think of anything . 
But it must think ... it can not hide ... 
Sirius's death is his fault , all of which is his fault . 
If it was , Harry , not stupid enough to be trapped by Voldemort , if it was not so convincing that the dream was real , if it had opened its mind to see Voldemort could , as Hermione had said . , taking advantage of its heroic heroism ... 
Unbearable , it can not think of it , can not tolerate it , a terrible emptiness in the depths of its soul that it does not want to feel , do not want to consider , a hole in place Sirius existed , where Sirius disappeared , he did not want to be alone in that vast silence , he could not stand it . 
A painting behind it snapped loudly , and an echo sounded , " Ali ... 
Harry Potter " . 
Phineas Nigellus yawned a long , stretched out hand while still observing Harry from behind his narrow eyes . 
" And what brought you here this morning ? " Phineas finally spoke . " This office has been closed with all but the rightful president . 
Did Dumbledore send you here ? 
Oh , do not tell me that ... " , he let go of a horrible yawn , " Another message to our useless little chit ? " 
Harry could not answer . 
Phineas does not know that Sirius is dead , but Harry can not tell him . 
Speaking up that is to admit it is true , can not be salvaged and can not be changed . . 
Add some moving portraits . 
This fear of being asked to make it strode through the room , and grabbed the door . 
The punch did not rotate , it was locked inside . 
" I hope this means , " said the tall witch with the red nose in the picture hanging behind the desk . The headmaster said , " is Dumbledore coming back to us soon ? " 
Harry turned around . 
The witch is looking at it with great interest . 
Harry nodded . 
She tugged at the door again , but the fist did not budge . 
" Well , " the witch said . " No Dumbledore here is so boring , it's so boring . " 
He sat on a chair like his throne , where he was painted on it , and smiled smugly at Harry . 
" Dumbledore put you up , I'm sure you know that , " he said comfortably , " Oh , yes , he values ​​ you very much . " 
The guilt filled Harry's chest like a hideous clamshell , now crouched in pain . 
Harry could not bear it , he could not bear to be himself for another minute ... he never felt trapped in his mind like that , never had a wish so intense that it could be someone , regardless of who , as long as it is not ... 
The empty fireplace flashed a green flame ; Harry jumps out of the door , staring at the rolling man in the oven . 
When Dumbledore's tall figure emerges from the fire , the witches on the surrounding walls start to woke up , many of them cheering up . 
" Thanks , " Dumbledore said softly . 
You do not look at Harry first , but go to the bird cage near the door and pull out , from the pocket of his cloak , the tiny , naked and ugly fawkes , and gently place it on top of the tray . The soft fly underneath the yellow pillar where the grown Fawkes are usually parked . 
" Oh , Harry , " he finally turned his head away from the bird , and said , " I would be glad to know that none of my classmates suffered any long - term injuries after the events of the day . " 
Harry tried to say " Good , " but no sound came out . 
It seemed Dumbledore had reminded him of the damage he had done , and though he had looked at it once , though his face looked intimidating rather than condemned , Harry did not dare to look . eyes in the instrument . 
" Mrs. Pomfrey is treating everyone , " said Dumbledore . " The Nymphadora Tonks may have been treated at St . Mungo Hospital for a short time , but it looks like she will recover completely . " 
Harry made himself look at the rug under his feet , the carpet was glowing as the sky outside became greener . 
He knew the portraits around the room were listening carefully to Dumbledore's words , wondering where Harry and Harry were , and why some were injured . 
" You know how I feel , Harry , " Dumbledore said in a low voice . 
" No , I do not know , " Harry blurted out , his voice rising and fierce , the mad rush in his heart , Dumbledore did not know how to feel it . 
" See , Dumbledore ? " Mischievous Phineas Nigellus said , " Do not try to understand the student . 
Kids do not like it . 
They like to be misunderstood in a more tragic way , like to be immersed in self - pity , self - restraint in ... " 
" Enough , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . 
Harry turned his back to Dumbledore and stared out the window . 
He could see the Quidditch pitch in the distance . 
Sirius had appeared there , disguised as a shaggy black dog , in order to see Harry play football ... maybe he came to see if Harry could play as good as his father or not . 
Harry never asked for that . 
" Your feelings are not as shameful , Harry , " said Dumbledore's voice . " On the other hand , feeling such pain is my greatest strength . " 
Harry felt his anger burn down his soul , burning in the terrible emptiness , a desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calm , and for the meaningless words ... 
" Your greatest strength , is it ? " Said Harry , his voice trembling as he stared uncontrollably at Quidditch . " You can not know ... you do not know ... " 
" You do not know what ? " Dumbledore asked calmly . 
Too much . 
Harry turned around , trembling with anger . 
" I do not want to talk about your feelings , okay ? " 
" Harry , feeling such pain just proved human divinity ! 
Pain is a part of humanity . " 
" HER - CON - NO - WANT - BE - CHILD ! " Harry screamed , and he grabbed a delicate silver musical instrument on the tall table next to it and tossed it , the musical instrument hitting the wall shattering . hundred pieces . 
Some pictures of screaming anger and panic , and portraits of Armando Dippet say " Really a ! " 
" I DO NOT KNOW ! " Cried Harry , grabbing the moon telescope and throwing it in the fire . ' I HAVE HAVE BEEN HAPPENED , HAVE BEEN EXCITED , THE SON Wants To End It , The Child Wants To End It , The Child Does NOT NEED TO KNOW " 
He grabbed the table with the instruments and threw it . 
The table broke into pieces on the floor , with each foot rolling one side . 
" I'm interested , " said Dumbledore . 
You do not flinch or do anything to prevent Harry from breaking office . 
He remained calm , almost isolated . " I focus on it so much that I feel like I'm going to bleed to death because of that wound . " 
' CON - NO ! " Harry screamed so loud that he felt the throat he wanted to tear out , for a second he wanted to break into the instrument and break it like he did with the things he'd done , breaking his old face calmly , shaking him , It hurt , making it notice a very small amount of disgust within it . 
" Oh , I do , " said Dumbledore , calmer than before , " I have lost my mother , my father , and the closest picture of fatherhood you have . 
Of course you care . " 
" HOW DO NOT KNOW THE CHILD HAPPEN ! " , Screamed Harry , " THANK YOU - THANK YOU " 
But words are not enough , breaking things is useful ; He wants to run , he wants to run forever and never turn around , he wants to go to a place where he does not have to see the blue eyes that stare at it , not to see the calm old face that hate . 
He turned quickly to the door , grabbed the door knob again and twisted strongly . 
But the door did not open . 
She turned to Dumbledore . 
" Let me go , " he said , shaking from head to toe . 
" No , " said Dumbledore . 
For a moment two people stared at each other . 
" Let me go , " he said again . 
" No , " Dumbledore repeated . 
" If you do not ... if you keep me here ... if you do not leave me ... " 
" Then I would do anything to destroy your belongings , " Dumbledore continued calmly . " You dare say you have a lot of things . " 
He walked around behind the table and sat down , watching Harry . 
" Let me go , " Harry continued in his nearly calm and calm tone . 
" Not yet , until you finish talking , " said Dumbledore . 
" Master ... I think I want to ... you think I will ... I do not care what you say ! " Harry screamed . " I do not want to hear anything you say ! " 
" I ' ll listen , " said Dumbledore firmly . " Because you're not really angry with me like you are . 
If you want to attack me , follow me know that I intend to do so , you will fully take it . 
" What did you say ? " 
" Sirius's dead is his fault , " he said plainly . " Or should I say , almost completely wrong with you - you are not arrogant to assume that you can shoulder all your responsibilities . 
Sirius is energetic , intelligent and brave , and the kind of person he normally can not afford to hide in the house while believing that other people are in danger . 
However , I can not believe that you need to be in the Dependency Department that night . 
If you had made it clear to me , Harry , that you should have done so , I may have known for a long time that Voldemort would try to lure you into the Confederacy , and you would not be cheated there that day . 
And Sirius will not have to chase her . 
That responsibility is in the teacher , only the teacher . 
Harry stood there , his hand on the doorknob , but there was no sense of it . 
He stared at Dumbledore , breathing hard , listening only to understand what he had just said . 
" Sit down , " said Dumbledore . This is not an order , but a request . 
Harry hesitated , then walked slowly through the room filled with silver gear and broken pieces of wood , and sat down in front of Dumbledore's desk . 
" I must understand that , " Phineas Nigellus said slowly from Harry's left , " is my little bit - the last of the Black clan , dead ? " 
" That's right , Phineas , " said Dumbledore . 
" I do not believe it , " Phineas said gruffly . 
Harry turned in time to see Phineas stepping over his portrait and he knew he had come to his other portrait at Grimmauld Square . 
Perhaps he was going , from one picture to another , calling Sirius from one end to the other . 
" Harry , I owe you an explanation , " said Dumbledore , " the explanation of the old man's faults . 
As you see now , what you have done , or did not do , is related to you , bearing all the signs of old age . 
Young people can not understand what age people think and feel . 
But old people would make mistakes if they forgot how young they were ... and apparently he had forgotten , recently ... " 
The sun is rising , a bright orange above the mountains and the sky above is colorless . 
The light shone on Dumbledore , on his eyebrows and silver beard , shining on the deep wrinkles on his face . 
" You guessed it fifteen years ago , " he said , " when you see the scar on your forehead , that it may be a sign of the bond between you and Voldemort . " 
" You said that , Professor , " said Harry flatly . 
He does not care whether he is rude or not . 
It does not care about anything . 
" Oh , " Dumbledore exclaimed . " Oh , but you know ... it's necessary to start with your scar . 
It's clear , shortly after you return to the magical world , you're right , and the scars warn you when Voldemort comes close , or when he has a strong feeling . " . 
" I know , " Harry said wearily . 
" And that ability of mine - finding out Voldemort's presence , even when he disguised himself , and knowing what he felt when his emotions were stirred - became even stronger since Voldemort had again his body and strength " 
Harry nodded sadly . 
He knew all this . 
" Recently , " he continued . " You start worrying that Voldemort can recognize the connection between you and him . 
Sure enough , once upon a time you penetrated so deeply into his mind that he felt his presence . 
Of course you are talking about the night you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley . " 
" Yes , Snape said so , " Harry murmured . 
" Professor Snape , Harry , " Dumbledore gently corrected . " But I do not wonder why you explain this to me is not you ? 
Why do not you teach me the Paphip ? 
Why do not you look at me for months ? " 
Harry looked up . 
Now he could see Dumbledore's sadness and fatigue . 
" Yes , " Harry muttered . " Yes , I was wondering . " 
" You have to understand , " Dumbledore continued . " I believe Voldemort will quickly try to control you , manipulate and distort your thoughts , and you do not want to encourage him any more . 
It is certain that if he found that our relationship was or was inherently more intimate than the relationship between a principal and his students , he could seize the opportunity to use the child as a means of reconnaissance ta 
I'm afraid he will 
Use your child , afraid he might try to control you . 
Harry , I believe you were right when you thought Voldemort might have taken advantage of you that way . 
On rare occasions when we meet , he thinks he saw his silhouette moving behind his eyes ... 
Harry remembered the feeling of a sleeping serpent waking up in it , ready to attack , at times when Dumbledore and him met each other . 
" The fact that Voldemort was trying to occupy me , as he expressed last night , was not against him . 
He wants to destroy me . 
Just when he had his son , he hoped he would sacrifice him to destroy him . 
You see , I tried , away from you , to protect you , Harry . 
A mistake ... " 
He let out a long sigh . 
Harry let his words drift away . 
It may have been desperate to know all these things a few months ago , but now they have no meaning in comparison to the cracks in it because of Sirius's death , nothing important now . . 
" Sirius told me you felt Voldemort waking up in you the night you saw Arthur Weasley attacked . 
He immediately realized that his concern had come true : Voldemort had realized that he could take advantage of her . In an attempt to equip your child against Voldemort's infiltration into his mind , he arranged his child's lessons with Professor Snape . " 
He pauses . 
Harry watched the sunshine slide slowly through his glossy table , illuminated with silver ink and a bright red brush . 
Harry could be sure that the portraits were up and listening attentively to Dumbledore's explanation , he could hear the occasional ruffle of his robes , his throbbing sound . 
Phineas Nigellus has not returned yet ... 
" Professor Snape discovered , " Dumbledore continued , " that you have dreamed of the Secret Service door for months . 
Obviously Voldemort was haunted by having heard the prophecy since he had recovered , and he had stopped at the door , so did he , even though I did not know what that meant . 
And when you see Rockwood , who was in the Secret Service before being arrested , tell Voldemort what we all know - that the prophecies kept in the Secret Service were strictly preserved . 
Only the person whom the prophecy mentions is able to take it off the shelf without insanity : in this case , either Voldemort had to penetrate the Ministry himself , and finally risk being exposed . ... or you will have to get it for him . 
It is imperative that you practice the Mandate . " 
" But you did not , " murmured Harry . 
He made that clear , trying to lessen the deadly weight of guilt in his heart : a confession would have relieved the terrible pressure that was weighing his heart . " I did not practice . 
I was not worried . 
I did not try to stop that dream , Hermione told me to do so , if you did that he would not be able to lead you anywhere , and ... Sirius will not ... Sirius will not ... " 
Something broke in it : it needed to explain it , need to explain ... 
" I tried checking to see if he really got Sirius , I went to Umbridge's office , I talked to Kreacher through the fire and it said Sirius was not there , he was gone ! " 
" Kreacher lied , " Dumbledore calmly said . " I'm not his master , he can lie to me without punishing myself . 
Kreacher wants you to go to the Ministry of Magic . " 
" It ... it deliberately .. ? " 
" Oh , yes . 
I'm afraid , Kreacher has served not just one owner for several months . " 
" How can that be ? " , Harry stammered . " It has not been out of Grimmauld Square for years . " 
Kreacher grabs that opportunity shortly before Christmas , " said Dumbledore . " When Sirius , apparently , shouted ' go away ' . 
He listened to Sirius , and understood the words were orders to leave the house . 
He came to the house of a member of the Black family that he respects ... 
Cousin of the Black Narcisssa , sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy . " 
" How do you know all that ? " Asked Harry . 
His heart beat . 
He felt sick . 
He remembers the anxiety of Kreacher's strange absence during Christmas , remembering the ejaculate reappearing in the attic ... 
" Kreacher told me yesterday , " said Dumbledore . " You know , when I sent Professor Snape an awkward warning , he realized he had seen Sirius captured inside the Secret Service . 
Just like me , he tried to contact Sirius immediately . 
He must explain that the members of the Order have more certain methods of communication than the fireplace in Dolores Umbridge's room . 
Professor Snape discovers Sirius live and safe at Grimmauld Square . 
" However , when I did not return after entering the forest with Dolores Umbridge , Professor Snape worried that I still believed Sirius was a prisoner of the Dark Lord Voldemort . 
He immediately alerted other members of the Society . " 
" Alastor Moody , Nymphadora Tonks , Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupine are at the Headquarters when he contacts . 
All agreed to save the child right . 
Professor Snape asked Sirius to stay , because there was someone in the Headquarters who informed him , because he also had to appear there . 
Meanwhile , he , Professor Snape , decided to go to the Forest to find the children . 
But Sirius did not want to stay there while others searched for the children . 
He gave the task of informing Kreacher . 
And so when he arrived at Grimmauld Square shortly after they made their way to the Ministry , the elf himself told him - while gleefully - in Sirius . " 
" Did he laugh ? " Said Harry in a hollow voice . 
" Oh , yes , " said Dumbledore . " You know , Kreacher can not betray us completely . 
It can not be the Secret Holder of the Society , it can not tell Malfoy where we are , or any secret plan of association that it is forbidden to disclose . 
It is limited by the blindness of the elves , who say that it can not disobey direct orders from its owner , Sirius . 
But it brought Narcissa a very valuable piece of information to Voldemort , but it was so trivial that Sirius did not think of banning it repeatedly . " 
" Like what ? " Asked Harry . 
" As if the Sirius were the most interested in the world , " said Dumbledore , " just as I regard Sirius as both a father and a brother . 
Obviously Voldemort knew that Sirius was in the Society , and that he knew where he was ... but Kreacher's information made him realize that the son could go far anywhere to rescue himself . is Sirius Black . 
Harry's lips were cold and numb . " So ... the night you asked Kreacher if Sirius was there ... " 
" The Malfoy House - apparently following Voldemort's instructions - told him to keep Sirius away once he saw his torture . 
So , if you decide to check whether Sirius is at home or not , Kreacher may pretend Sirius is away . 
Kreacher had hurt Buckbeak the day before , and , when he appeared in the fire , Sirius was on the couch to take care of it . " 
There seemed to be very little air in Harry's chest , it breathless and deep . 
" And Kreacher told him all that ... and laughed ? " He moaned . 
" He does not want to talk to you , " said Dumbledore . " But he had mastered the Legilimens to find out when someone was lying to him and his teacher ... convince him ... tell the master . story set , before you go to the Ministry of Magic . 
" And , " Harry whispered , his hands clenched in his knees , " and Hermione kept telling us to be kind to him . " 
" She is quite full , Harry , " said Dumbledore . " You have warned Sirius when we chose Grimmauld Square as the Headquarters that Kreacher needs to be treated with kindness and respect . 
He also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous for us . 
You do not think that Sirius seriously paid attention to what he said , or considered Kreacher as a creature with subtle human emotions ... " 
" Are not you blaming ... are not you ... 
Speaking of Sirius as if ... " . 
The breath whirled , it did not say exactly what it was thinking , but the anger had sunk in it : it was impossible for Dumbledore to criticize Sirius . " Kreacher is a liar . ... it should be ... " 
" How Kreacher was created by the witches , Harry , " said Dumbledore , " Oh , it's pitiful . 
Its life is as miserable as your friend Dobby . 
It was forced to obey Sirius's orders , because Sirius was the last of the clans that was a slave , but he had no loyalty to him . 
And whatever Kreacher has faults , it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to improve his life ... " 
" SAY ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THERE , " exclaimed Harry . 
He stood up , furious , ready to dash into Dumbledore , he did not know anything about Sirius , no courage , how much he has suffered so much ... 
" What about Snape , " Harry snapped , " do not you talk about him ? 
When I told him Voldemort took Sirius , he just looked at me as usual .. " 
" Harry , I know Professor Snape can do nothing but make me look at you in front of Dolores Umbridge , " Dumbledore said calmly , " but as you said , he informed the Association as soon as possible . the thing you said . 
He himself figured out where he had gone when he did not return from the Forest . 
And he himself gave Umbridge medication when she tried to force him to speak to Sirius's hiding place . " 
Harry , no matter what , felt a malicious desire to criticize Snape , which seemed to reduce his terrible guilt , and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree to it . 
" Snape ... 
Snape . . 
d . sniffing Sirius on his stay in the house .. he said Sirius is a coward .. " 
" Sirius is mature and wise enough not to let such ridiculous sarcasm hurt , " said Dumbledore . 
" Snape did not teach me the lessons of Feng Shui anymore ! " Harry grumbled . " He threw me out of the office ! " 
" You know that , " said the heavy Dumbledore . " You said it was your fault that you did not teach yourself , even though you were sure there was nothing more dangerous than opening your mind . Voldemort penetrates while he is present ... " 
" Snape makes it worse , my scar is always worse after school , " Harry remembered Ron's comments on that and plunged into " ... how did you know he did not try weakened Voldemort , making him easy to penetrate . " 
" You believe in Severus Snape , " Dumbledore said simply . " But I forgot - again , a bruise - that some wounds were too heavy to heal . 
I think Professor Snape can overcome the aversion to my father . 
You were wrong . " 
" But that's okay , is not it ? " Harry yelled , ignoring the annoying faces and murmuring protests from the wall portraits . " Snape hates his father , and Sirius hates Kreacher ? " 
" Sirius does not hate Kreacher , " Dumbledore said . " He regarded it as a useless servant without any concern or concern . 
Ignorance and neglect often cause more harm than obvious hatred ... the well that we destroyed in the day is a false image . 
We sorcerers have abused and exploited our friends for a long time , and now we have to bear the consequences . " 
" SO WHAT SIRIUS MUST BE , DO YOU ? " Harry shouted . 
" I do not say that , and I probably have not seen you say anything like that , " said Dumbledore calmly . " Sirius is not a wicked man , he is generally good with elves . 
He does not love Kreacher , because it reminds him of the house he hates . " 
" Yes , he hates it ! " Said Harry , his voice breaking , turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away . 
The sun was shining all over the room and the eyes of the portraits as they walked unconsciously , not looking at the room . " I want him to lock himself in the house and he hates that , that's why he left home last night ... " 
He tried to keep Sirius alive , Dumbledore said quietly . 
Nobody wants to be locked up ! Harry said angrily , walking around . You did that to me all summer . 
Dumbledore closed his eyes and covered his face with long , bony hands . 
Harry looked at him , but it was hardly recognizable as exhaustion , or fatigue , or any of Dumbledore's emotions , that did not calm him down . 
On the contrary , it felt even more angry when Dumbledore was weak . 
You do not have the weak right to be angry with Harry and scream at him . 
Dumbledore lowered his hand and looked at Harry through semicircular glasses . 
This is the moment , he said , to tell me what you should have told me five years ago , Harry . 
Sit down . 
You will tell me all . 
You just asked for a little patience . 
I still have the opportunity to be angry with you - to do what I like - when you stop . 
You will not stop me . 
Harry glared at him for a moment , then plopped down on the bench opposite him and waited . 
Dumbledore looked at the sunlit yard outside the window for a moment , then looked back at Harry and said , Five years before you came to Hogwarts , Harry , safe and secure , as he had arranged and expected . Well - not very peace . 
I was hurt . 
You know that I will be hurt when you leave me on the threshold of your aunt . 
You know that you have condemned me to ten years of misery and gloom . 
He pauses . 
Harry did not say anything . 
You may ask - and it is very reasonable to ask - why did you do that ? 
Why not let some witch family get children ? 
There are many families , more than happy , proud and happy to raise children like a son . 
Your answer is that you give priority to keeping your child alive first . 
You are more dangerous than anyone and you know it . 
Voldemort had disappeared a few hours ago , but his subordinates - and many of them as terrified as he was - were still angry , desperate and violent . 
And he must also make decisions about the coming years . 
Do you believe that Voldemort was gone forever ? 
Are not . You know that no matter what , ten or twenty years later , he will surely come back , and you know for sure , because you know him well , that he will not stop until he kills you . 
You know that Voldemort's magical knowledge may well outstrip any contemporary witch . 
He knows that even his most complicated and powerful spells and talents can not be won when he returns to full power . 
But he also knows Voldemort's weakness . 
And so he made the decision . 
I was protected by an ancient magic that he knew well , he despised and therefore he had to pay for underestimating it . 
Of course you are talking about the mother's death to protect her . 
She gave me a long - term protection that he never waited for , a protection still flowing in my blood vessels until now . 
So you put faith in the blood of your mother . 
He gave her to her sister , the only remaining one . 
She did not love me , Harry said , She was not a little ... " 
But she got her son , Dumbledore interrupted . She may have fed her reluctantly , reluctantly , furiously , and bitterly , but she still took the child , and in doing so , she vouchsafed the spell I had placed on her . 
Your mother's sacrifice has made the bloodline the strongest shield that you can give her . 
I still do not ... 
Until you call your mother's home , you can not be touched or harmed by Voldemort . 
He bleeds , but the blood is still alive in her and her sister . 
Her blood has become a refuge for her . 
You only need to go back to that place once a year , but when you still call it home , he can not hurt you . 
Your aunt knows this . 
I explained this in the letter that I left with you on her doorstep . 
She knew that allowing her to stay would keep her alive for fifteen years . 
Wait a minute , Harry said ... 
He sat up straight in the chair , staring at Dumbledore . 
He sent the Letter . 
He reminded her to remember - it was his voice ... 
He thought , Dumbledore said , slightly inclined his head , that she might need to be reminded of the treaty she had signed up for . 
I suspect the fact that the Dementors attacked her might have reminded her of the danger of adopting her . 
That happened , Harry whispered . 
And your stepfather is more than that . 
He wanted to get rid of me , but after the letter came , she said she had to stay . 
He looked at the ceiling for a moment , then said , But that has something to do with ... 
It can not say the name of Sirius . 
Five years ago , Dumbledore continued , as if he had not interrupted , I went to Hogwarts , maybe I was not happy and nurtured as he waited , but alive and well . 
I'm not a pampered little prince , but like a normal kid you can hope to have under such conditions . 
Until then , his plan was somewhat successful . 
And then , maybe you remember well the events of your first year at Hogwarts as you did . 
I fought so hard with the challenges and sooner ... a lot sooner than you expected ... I faced myself to Voldemort . 
You survived . 
You do more than that . 
I prevented his return with full power and strength . 
I fought like a man . 
You are more proud of me than you can say . 
But there is a shortcoming in the master plan , Dumbledore said , An omission that he knows might even upset everything . 
And then , knowing how important the success of your plan is , you have told yourself that it can not be left to ruin it . 
You can stand alone , so you must be strong alone . 
And that was his first test , when he left his son in the infirmary , weak after his fight with Voldemort . 
I do not understand what you mean , Harry said . 
I do not remember asking you , when I was in the infirmary , why did Voldemort try to kill you when you were a kid ? 
Harry nodded . 
Should you tell me that ? 
Harry stared at the blue eyes and said nothing , but his heart thumped . 
Do not you see the shortcoming in your plan ? 
Could not be . 
Well , as you know , he decided not to answer . 
Eleven years old , he told himself , was too young to know that . 
You never wanted to tell me or when I was eleven . 
Knowing that might be too much for a baby at that age . 
" You should have noticed the danger signs . 
You should have wondered why you did not feel embarrassed when you asked me a question that you knew , one day , you must give a terrible answer . 
He realized that he was happy to think that he did not have to do that the day he was too young , too young 
And then in the second year at Hogwarts . 
And again , I meet the challenges even from the adult witches I have never met : once again , I am dealing with more than my wildest dreams . 
But I did not ask you again , why Voldemort left that mark on you . 
We talked about my scars , well , we were very close to the problem . 
Why do not you say anything to me ? 
" Well , anyway , with the twelve - year - old , it looks like no more than eleven years old to receive such information . 
You let me leave you , full of blood , exhausted but cheerful , and if you feel a little bit bothered that you should probably tell me , then it immediately resumed . 
You see , I was too young , and you see that you can not ruin the night of victory 
Did you see , Harry ? 
Now you see the shortcoming in your master plan ? 
You fall into the trap that you saw before , but you have told yourself that you can avoid , which you need to avoid . 
I do not ... 
You have taken too much interest in me , Dumbledore said simply . You have been more interested in my happiness than giving me the facts , paying more attention to the peace of my heart than my plans , paying more attention to my life than my life . It can be lost if your plan fails . 
In other words , he behaved exactly what Voldemort expected of the idiots as we would like to do . 
Is that an excuse ? 
Teacher , regardless of who cares for me like you - and he watched me closely than I could imagine - would not let me suffer more than what you had to endure . 
What do you do if there are some people and other creatures that you do not know will be slaughtered in an indescribable future , if you live here , and happy ? 
I never dreamed that I would care for such a person . 
When I was in the third year . 
You watched from afar when you fought to repel the Dementors , when you found Sirius , find out who he is and save him . 
At that time , should you tell me , when you are winning when you take back the godfather from the Ministry ? 
But at the age of thirteen , his excuses were gone . 
You may be young , but you have proved that you are an exception . 
Your conscience is not calm , Harry . 
You know that time will soon come 
But last year I escaped from the labyrinth , witnessing the death of Cedric Diggory , then escaped death himself , and he did not tell me , even if he knew , that Voldemort had come back . , you must tell me soon . 
And now , tonight , I know you've been willing to listen to what you've done 
Hide your children for too long , because you have proven that you should have put this burden on you before . 
His only defense was this : He saw me fighting under the weightlessness that no student had ever experienced in this school , and he could not put another burden on me , heavier than all . 
Harry waited , but Dumbledore did not speak . 
I still do not understand . 
Voldemort tried to kill me when I was just a baby because of a prophecy not long after I was born . 
He knew about the prophecy , even though he did not know the whole story . 
He went to kill me when I was still a baby , believing he had accomplished what was predicted . 
He found out that he was wrong , and paid the price , when the curse he used to kill the child back . 
Then , when he returned to his body , and especially when he escaped spectacularly from him last year , he decided to hear the whole prophecy . That's the weapon he's been persistently looking for since his return : knowledge of how to kill him . 
The sun is now up : Dumbledore's office is bathing in the sunshine . 
The treasure chest in which Godric Gryffindor's sword was set was white and dim , the broken pieces that Harry had thrown at the floor were glittering like rain drops , and behind him , the immature Fawkes crying in its ash nest . 
The prophet's arrow was broken , Harry said blankly . 
At that time I was pulling Neville up the stairs in the - the room had the archway , then I torn his shirt and it fell down . " 
" The broken thing was merely a record of the prophecy kept by the Confederacy . 
But that prophecy was told to another person , and he could recall it quite accurately . 
Who heard it ? Harry asked , though he thought he knew the answer . 
It's you , Dumbledore said , in a cold , humid night sixteen years ago , in a room on the bar at Pork's Bar . 
He was there to meet a candidate for the Prophet's teacher position , although allowing the Prophet to continue teaching was contrary to his will . 
However , this candidate is the granddaughter of a very famous genius prophet and he thinks he should meet her for the common courtesy . 
Teacher was disappointed . 
It seems she does not seem to inherit that talent . 
He told her , he hoped he was courteous enough , that he did not think she was suitable for that position . 
Then he turned to leave . 
Dumbledore stood up and crossed Harry toward the black closet next to the Fawkes cage . 
He leaned down , pulled a drawer and took out a shallow stone basin , carved around , the pot in which Harry had seen his father tease Snape . 
Dumbledore walked over to the table , placed the Sign , and placed the wand on his temple . 
He drew from it the wisps of thin silvery thought , like silk , on the tip of a chopstick and drop it into the pot . 
He sat down behind the table and watched his thoughts spin 
float in the pot for a while . 
Then , letting go of a sigh , he lifted his chopsticks and dipped his chopsticks in the silver . 
A glinted image , wrapped in a towel , her eyes zoomed up behind her glasses , and she slowly turned around , her legs set on the pot . 
But when Sybill Trelawney spoke , it was not a high - pitched mystical voice , but a hoarse , hard - to - hear voice that Harry had never heard her use before : 
The person who has the power to defeat the Dark Lord is about to emerge , born of those who have challenged him three times ... born when the seventh month dies and the Dark Lord marks the man as one . It is equivalent to a person , but this person will have powers that the Dark Lord does not know and one of them must die at the other's hand because no one can live while the other person is alive . The Force to defeat the Dark Lord will be born when the seventh month dies 
Professor Trelawney's body spins slowly and sinks into the silver puddle at the bottom and disappears . 
The office became absolutely quiet . 
Dumbledore , Harry and the paintings did not emit a sound . 
Even Fawkes sank into silence . 
Professor Dumbledore ? Harry said very softly , and Dumbledore , still looking at him in the signpost , seemed completely lost in thought . Does that mean that what it means ? 
It means , Dumbledore said , that the only one who could defeat Lord Voldemort would be born in late July of nearly sixteen years ago . 
This baby will be born of a couple who has three times challenged Voldemort . 
Harry felt something stifling inside of him . 
Its breathing seems to be hard . 
does that mean ... baby ? 
Dumbledore looked at him briefly through his glasses . 
The strange thing is , Harry , the gentleman said , may not be the child . 
Sybill's prophecy can be used for two wizards , born in late July of that year , both having their parents in the Order of the Phoenix , both of whom escape Voldemort in the Silk Road . interlocking hair . 
One , of course , is the child . 
The other is Neville Longbottom . 
But , why is your name on the sphere of prophecy , not Neville ? 
" The official record labeled the baby after Voldemort attacked me when I was a kid , " said Dumbledore , who made the Prophet's guardian feel that Voldemort could have tried to kill her just because of He knew that the child was Sybil who mentioned " 
So that is ... maybe it's not me ? Said Harry . 
I'm afraid , Dumbledore said slowly , it seemed like every word had taken a lot of effort from him , no doubt , that kid was the child . 
But , he said - Neville was born in the end of July , - and his parents ... " 
I forgot the next part of the prophecy , the trace to identify the child that could defeat Voldemort Voldemort would mark himself as his equivalent . 
And he did , Harry . 
He chose her , not Neville . 
He left the scar with both blessings and curses . 
But maybe he made the wrong choice ! Said Harry . He may have marked the wrong person ! 
He chose the child he thought was dangerous to him , Dumbledore said , and noticed , Harry : He chose , not a pureblood ( these , according to his beliefs , were the The only witch that is worth or worth knowing is attacking a doped human , like him . 
He saw himself in me even before he saw me , and marked me with a scar , and he did not kill me the way he wanted me to , giving me strength and a future , in which you can escape from him not just one , but four times until now - things that both parents and Neville's parents can not do . 
Then why did he do that ? Said Harry , feeling numb and cold . Why did he try to kill me when I was a newborn ? 
Why did not he wait to see if Neville or you were more dangerous to him when we grew up and tried to kill anyone ? 
This thought , indeed , seemed more realistic , Dumbledore said , except that Voldemort had not had enough information about this prophecy . 
The Pork bar , where Sybill chose for cheap , attracted , say how , more interesting customers in Three Brooms . 
As you and your friends have known , at your own expense , and you have to pay the price of the teacher , it is a place that has never been safe to ensure that you are not being eavesdropped . 
Of course , he did not dream that , when he came to see Sybill Trelawney , he saw if anyone eavesdropped . 
The great fortune of our teacher - the eavesdropper - was discovered when the prophecy was just read and thrown out . 
So he just heard ... ? 
He only heard the opening , saying that the baby born in July had parents three times challenged Voldemort . 
Therefore , he did not warn his master that the attack could lead to the risk of passing power to him , and marking him as his equivalent . 
So Voldemort never knew that attacking me might be dangerous , that if I had to wait for more , it might be wiser . 
He may not know that you have the powers the Dark Lord does not know ... " 
But I do not ! Harry says , trying to tone down , I have no power that he does not have , I can not fight like he did last night , I can not control others ... or kill them ... 
There was a room in the Dumbledore Department interrupting , always locked . 
It has no force yet more miraculous and horrible than death , than human intelligence , than all natural forces . It may also be the most mysterious of the problems studied there . 
You have the same power as in that room and Voldemort is not . 
That power made me come to Sirius this evening . 
That power prevented me from being possessed by Voldemort , because he could not live in a body full of the powers he hated . 
Finally , the problem is not that the child can freeze his or her mind . 
Your heart saved me . 
Harry closed his eyes . 
If it did not go to rescue Sirius , he would not die trying to stop himself from thinking about Sirius , Harry asked , without much concern for the answer . The end of the prophecy it said something about No one can survive while the other survives , Dumbledore said . 
So , Harry said , trying to say from the feeling of despair inside him , it meant either , you and him , to kill the other at the end ? 
Yes , Dumbledore said . 
No one said anything for a long time . Somewhere outside the walls of the office , Harry could hear the noise , the students walking down the Great Hall , able to eat early . 
It seems unlikely that there are still people in the world who still want to eat , still can laugh , do not know or care about Sirius gone forever . 
Sirius is probably thousands of miles away ; Even now part of Harry still believes he just fell into that veil , and then he ' ll see Sirius turn to look at him , greet him , maybe , with the laugh of his barking . 
You owed me another explanation , Harry , Dumbledore hesitantly said . 
Maybe I was wondering why did not you choose me as the leader ? 
You must admit that you thought you were too responsible enough to take charge . 
Harry looked up and saw a drool of tears flowing down Dumbledore's face , rolling down his long bearded silver hair . 
Chapter 38 : The Second Battle 
WEDDING - ROOM - CALL - NAME - RAINBACK 
" In a brief statement on Friday night , Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that Caller - turned - name turned the country and re - enacted it . 
" It is extremely unfortunate that I have to admit that the witch is the Lord of War - surely people know who I am referring to - and live among us again , " said Fudge , looking at him . Looks tired and confused k hi talk to reporters . 
" It is unfortunate that we have to report on the large - scale rebellion of the Dementors in Azkaban , against those who continue to serve the Ministry of Magic . 
We believe that the name Dementor is under the control of the Lord - I do not want to name this " 
" We emphasize that witchers should be on the alert . 
The Ministry is currently publishing its basic self - defense guidelines for individuals and families and will distribute free of charge to witch families next month . " 
" The minister's statement made the witch community panic and triggered alarm bells , because the newest one last Wednesday was the ministry's assurances that " there is no truth to it . In the long - standing rumors of Who - Know - Who - Who - know - it has risen in our mind again . " 
" The details that led to the Department's sudden change of mind are still ambiguous , but it is possible to believe that the He - do - not - named - out group of followers ( known under the Death Eater ) broke into the Ministry of thugs on Thursday evening . 
" Albus Dumbledore , newly renamed Rector of Hogwarts School of Water and Sorcery , newly re - elected member of the Wizarding International Alliance , Wizengamot's new reincarnation rector , has yet to give a speech . comment . 
He claimed throughout the year that the Who - Who - Is - Who - Did not die , as had been hoped for and so widely believed , that again was recruiting the followers try to take power . 
Meanwhile , " you - baby - live - survive " . . 
" You come here again , Harry , I know how they pull you in , " Hermione said as she looked at it across the top of the newspaper . 
We are in the infirmary . 
Harry sat at Ron's bedside and both of them listened to Hermione read the first page of the Sunday Prophet . 
Ginny , an ankle heaped by Pompfrey in a flash , fell at the foot of Hermione's bed ; Neville , with his nose almost back to normal shape and size , was sitting on a chair set between two beds ; and Luna , who had just visited , held the latest issue of The New Enchantress , was reading the magazine and was not listening to a word from Hernione . 
" He is " Baby - live - survivor " right ? " Ron said somberly . " Is not that a parody anymore ? " 
He rewarded himself with a few pieces of chocolate frogs in a large pile on the bedside drawer , throwing a few for Harry , Ginny and Neville , while he torn his bag with his teeth . 
There are still bumps on his arm where the tentacles of the brain wrap it . 
According to Pompfrey , thoughts can leave scars worse than anything else , but since she has used a large amount of forgotten Dr . Ubbly's remedies , the situation seems to have progressed . 
" Yes , they praise you , Harry , " Hermione said and glanced down at the article . 
" A solitary voice of truth is considered inauspicious , unwavering in the story to be subjected to ridicule and libel . " 
" I see they did not even mention that they themselves had engaged in that scandal and libel in the Prophet " 
She frowned and put one hand on her ribs . 
Dolohov's curse worked for her , though the effect was lighter than he had expected if he could read the spell aloud , though that would have been enough , Pompfrey said , " enough damage . suffer " . 
Hermione is using ten different types of herbs each day , recovering significantly and is actually sick of this clinic . 
" The last - of - its - kind - to - know endeavor to seize power , pages two through four , Things the Ministry should tell us , page five , Why not ? Anyone listening to Albus Dumbledore , from page six to page eight , Special Interview with Harry Potter , Good Nine , " said Hermione , folding the newspaper and throwing it aside , " there is a lot to write about . . 
And that interview with Harry Potter was nothing special , it was a post in the magazine Chi Wei Bien few months ago " 
" Dad sold it to them , " Luna said ambiguously and flipped a page in the magazine The Wei . " You are bidding reasonably high , so we will have an adventure in Sweden this summer , maybe we did not catch a Crumple - Horned Snorkack . " 
Hermione seemed to struggle for a moment and said , " Hear that ? " 
Ginny touched Harry's eyes and looked away and grinned . 
" Well , anyway , " Hermione said , standing up a little and frowning , " in school ? " 
" Well , Flitwick did Fred and George's marshes disappear in a flash , " Ginny said , " you only took three seconds . 
But you have left a small space under the window and just around it . " 
" Why is that ? 
Said Hermione , looking startled 
" Oh , you said it was so good , " Ginny shrugged and said 
" I thought he wanted to leave it to celebrate Fred and George , " Ron said through his chocolate mouth . " You know , they sent me all these things , " he said to Harry and pointed to a pile of big chocolate frogs beside him . " Are they sure to make a good living with that boutique ? 
Hermione looked disgruntled and asked , " So will the trouble stop when Dumbledore returns ? " 
" Yes , " Neville said , " everything will be back to normal . " 
" I hope Filch will be happy ? 
Asked Ron and put the card in a frog - shaped chocolate frog pocket on his jar . 
" That's not it , " Ginny said . " He's really hurt . " She lowered her voice in a whisper . " He kept saying Umbridge was the best thing ever for Hogwarts 
The six looked around . 
Professor Umbridge was lying on the bed opposite them and staring at the ceiling . 
Dumbledore ran to the forest alone and saved her from the centaurs ; How did he do that - dragged Professor Umbridge out of the trees without a scratch on him - no one knew , and Umbridge would never tell . 
Since she returned to the castle , as far as I know , she uttered a word . 
Nobody really knows what happened to her . 
Her neat gray hair was messy and there were small branches and leaves on it , but she was not hurt . 
" Mrs. Pompfrey said she was still in shock , " Hermione whispered 
" It seems to be sulking , " Ginny said 
" Yes , she will reveal the signs of life if you do this , " said Ron , his tongue giving a small crack . 
Mrs. Umbridge sat up straight , looking around wildly . 
" What is it , Professor ? " Mrs. Pompfey called and poked her head through the door . 
" No , " said Umbridge , hiding herself in the pillows . " I must be dreaming " 
Hermione and Ginny hide their laughter behind the bed sheets . 
" Speak of the centaurs , " said Hermione after a little while , " Now who is the Prophet ? 
Will Firenze continue to teach ? " 
" He still teaches , " said Harry , " other centaurs will never receive him again , will they ? " 
" It looks like he and Trelawney will teach , " Ginny said 
" I'm Dumbledore wanting to get away from Miss Trelawney , " said Ron and chewed on the fourteenth frog . " Remember , if you ask me , the whole subject is useless , Firenze is no better " 
" How can you say that ? " Hermione asked . " After we know that there are real prophecies ? " 
Harry's heart started beating hard . 
He did not tell Ron , Hermione or anyone else the prophecy contained anything . 
Neville told them that it was shattered into pieces when Harry pulled it up the stairs in the Dead Room and Harry did not correct the image . 
It's not ready to see people's reactions when it tells them it's either a killer , or a victim , no other way . 
" It's a shame it broke , " said Hermione , shaking her head . 
" Yes , " said Ron . " However , at least who - knows - who - knows - there's never been anything inside of it - where are you going ? " Frustrated , he added as he saw Harry stand up . 
" Oh - go to Uncle Hagrid , " said Harry , " You know , he just came back and I promised to tell you about your situation . 
" Oh , that's it , " said Ron harshly , " looking at the heavenly sky outside the window . " If only we could go . " 
" Welcome to us , Hermione ! " Hermione called when Harry came down from the property . " And ask him what happened to his little friend ! " 
Harry waved his hand to show that she had heard and understood her words . 
The castle seems quiet , even on Sunday . 
Everyone went out to the sun to enjoy the final exams and the last days of the course were free from exam preparation as well as exercises . 
Harry walked slowly along the quiet corridor , staring out the window at every step ; He could see people hovering in the air above Quidditch and two male and female students swimming in the lake with a giant squid . 
It is difficult to decide whether you want to be with everyone or not ; Whenever it has people around it wants to get away and when it alone wants to have someone next door . 
He thought he might come to see Hagrid , though he had not talked to him since he'd returned 
Harry stepped down to the marble floor leading to the lobby . Malloy , Crabbe and Goyle appeared from a door on the right that he knew led to the Slytherin common room . 
Harry stood there , Malfoy and the other straight . 
The only sounds are screams , laughter , and water splashing into the Hall from outside the open front door . 
Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking to see if there was a teacher - then he turned to look at Harry and lowered his voice , " You're dead , Potter . " 
Harry raised his eyebrows . 
" It's so funny , " he said , " you should think I've stopped walking . " 
Malfoy looked more angry than Harry had ever seen ; He felt the comfort of being stripped of his face when he saw his face recoiled , distorted by rage . 
" You will have to pay , " Malfoy said in a voice louder than the whisper , " I ' ll make you pay for what you do with my dad . " 
" Oh , now I'm scared , " said Harry in a sarcastic voice . " I think Lord Voldemort just got a boot like your daddy - what's wrong ? " He added , seeing that both Malfoy , Crabble and Goyle were all excited by that name . " He's your father's friend , is not he ? 
Are not you afraid of him ? 
" You think you're a great man , Potter , " Malfoy said , Crabble and Goyle agreeing . " You wait , I ' ll catch you . 
You can not put my father in prison " 
" I think I did , " Harry said . 
" The Dementors have gone out of Azkaban , " Malfoy said softly . " Daddy and the others will be out soon " 
" Yes , I hope those guys will do it , " said Harry , " at least everyone knows what they are now . 
Malfoy's hand came to his wand , but Harry was too fast ; He withdrew his wand even before Malfoy's fingers popped into his pocket . 
" Potter ! " 
The voice echoes along the Hall . 
Snape's teacher appeared at the stairs leading down to his office , and from his gaze , Harry felt the hatred coming over whatever it was for Malfoy , whatever Dumbledore said . , it will never forgive Snape never 
" What are you doing , Potter ? " Snape said coldly as he walked up to the four of them . 
" You're trying to decide what curse Malfoy will use , sir , " Harry answered fiercely . 
Snape looked at it . 
" Save the wand immediately , " he said curtly . " Subtracting the Gryffindor's ten points - " He looked at the huge sand clock on the wall and gave a cackling smile . 
" Ah , I see no point at Gryffindor's hourglass for all that . 
In that case , Potter , we would simply have to - 
" Add a little ? " 
Professor McGonagall staggered up the steps leading up to the castle , one of her hands carrying a heavy , cross - strapped luggage bag against the sticks on the other , but she seemed to be in good health . 
" Professor McGonnagall ! " Said Snape , striding forward , " out of St . Mungo's Hospital , yes ! " 
" Yes , Professor Snape , " Professor McGonagall said , " I'm as good as new . 
Crabble and Goyle . " She proudly waved her hands and signaled them and stepped forward , dragging her long legs and looking awkward . 
" Hey , " Professor McGonagall said , pushing the bag into Crabble's chest and gown to Goyle's chest , " bring these things to my office . " 
They turned and walked up the marble stairs . 
" Well , " said Professor McGonagall , looking up at the sand - clocks on the wall . " Yeah , I think Potter and his friends need fifty for each of us to warn the world about the return . Who - knows - well - who - knows - who ! 
What do you say , Professor Snape ? " 
" What ? " Snape snapped , though Harry knew he knew very well , " Well , well , I think " 
Then fifty points for Potter , the Weasleys , Longbottom and Ladies Granger , " said Professor McGonagall , and a ruby ​​ rain fell under Gryffindor's hourglass when she spoke . " Oh - and fifty points for Lady Lovegood , I think , " she added , and many of the sapphires fell on Ravenclaw's watch . " Now you want to get rid of Ten Potter , I think , Professor Snape - then we have " 
Rubies are drained on the hourglass , but still leave a large amount at the bottom . 
" Then , Potter , Malfoy , I think you should go out on a nice day like today , " Professor McGonagall said briskly . 
Harry did not need to talk a second time - he put his wand back into his cloak and headed straight to the front door without looking back at Snape and Malfoy . 
The hot sun shone down on it with a breath of warmth as it passed through the grass to Hagrid's hut . 
The schoolboy lay sprawled on the lawn to sunbathe , chat , read the Sunday Prophet , and chew the candy , looking up as he passed it ; Some called it , others waved their hands , clearly they were eager to prove that they , like the Prophet , decided to treat it as a hero . 
Harry did not say anything to them . 
It does not know how much they know about what happened three days ago , but it has avoided being questioned and preferring to do it that way . 
At first he thought when he knocked on Hagrid's hut he was gone , but then Fang rushed in from the corner and almost rolled over with his enthusiastic welcome . 
Hagrid was harvesting the bean trees that ran in the back garden . 
" All right , Harry , " he said and beamed as Harry approached the fence . " Come here , we ' ll drink a dandelion cup " 
" What's going on ? " Hagrid asked him as they sat down on the wooden table with a glass of ice - water in their hands . " Oh , do you feel good ? " 
With a look on Hagrid's face , Harry knew he did not mention his health . 
" 
I'm fine , " Harry answered quickly , because he could not bear to speak of what he knew was in Hagrid's head . " So where were you ? " 
" Hiding in the mountains , " replied Hagrid , " In a cave , like Sirius did when he 
Hagrid stopped , swallowed his throat slightly , looked at Harry and drank a long drink of juice . 
" Anyway back , " he said weakly . 
" You look better , " said Harry , trying to keep the conversation away from Sirius . 
" What ? " Uncle Hagrid said , lifting his big hand and trying to feel his face . " Yes , well , Grawpy is behaving better . 
It seems pleased to see me back , to tell him the truth . 
He's a good guy , really , I've been thinking about trying to find him a girlfriend , actually " 
Normally , Harry tried to persuade Hagrid to forget this intention immediately ; The prospect of a second giant living in the Forest , even wilder and more cruel than Grawp , is alarming , but for some reason Harry is not strong enough to point out that . 
He started to dream of being alone , and with the thought of going out fast , he took a few large sips of dandelion juice , drank half a cup . 
" Everybody knows I'm telling the truth , Harry , " said Hagrid gently and unintentionally . 
Harry was very close to Harry . " That's better ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
" See this , " said Hagrid , leaning across the table , " I know Sirius is dead longer than his nephew died in battle , and that's how he wants to be . " 
" He does not want to go ! " Harry answered angrily . 
Uncle Hagrid bent his head down 
" Hey , I do not think he's gone , " he said quietly . " But anyway , Harry was never the only one sitting at home but letting others fight . 
He can not tolerate sitting at home if he can help . 
Harry jumped up . 
" I have to visit Ron and Hermione at the hospital , " he said mechanically . " Oh , " said Hagrid , looking unhappy . " Oh well , Harry's careful , and come back if you have 
" Yes , sir " 
Harry walked to the door as fast as he could and opened it ; It was in the sun before Hagrid could say his farewell , and he stepped on the lawn . 
Again , people ring when it passes . 
He closed his eyes for a few moments , hoping that all of them would disappear , so that he could open his eyes and find himself alone on the ground . 
The day before yesterday , before its exam ended and it saw Verdemort's image spring up in his mind , it was able to give almost everything to the witch world to know that it told the truth , so They believe that Voldemort has come back , and to know that it is not a liar or a madman . 
Anyway now 
He took a shortcut to the lake , sat down on the shore , hid behind a bush , avoiding the look of the passerby , staring at the lake like a mirror and thinking Maybe the reason why he wanted the main It feels isolated from everyone since talking to Dumbledore . 
An invisible barrier between itself and the rest of the world . 
It - as it was before - is a different person . 
Only thing that never really understood what that means 
Now sitting here by the lake , with the pain of pain , with the pain of losing Serbian pain and freshness in her heart , she could not gather any fear of it . 
The sun is bright and the ground around is full of laughters , and even feels distant from them as if it belonged to another race , it is hard to believe that when it sits here its life must contain Contain , or end with murder 
He sat there for a long time , looking at the water , trying not to think about his godfather or remembering that right from here across the lake was the place where Uncle Serius fell once to fight hundreds . Dementor 
The sun dives before it feels cold . 
He got up and turned to the castle , drying his face with his sleeves as he walked . 
Ron and Hermione left the hospital three days before the end of the semester . 
Hermione still wants to talk about Serius , but Ron always slides whenever she mentions his name . 
Harry was not sure whether he wanted to talk about his godfather or not ; Its desire varies with mood . 
He knew something even though he was not happy at the moment , but he would miss Hogwarts extremely well in a few days as he returned to Privet Drive . 
Although he now knows very well why it must come back every summer , it does not feel better . 
In fact , it scared her return trip . 
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts one day before the end of the semester . 
Apparently she had crawled out of the infirmary for dinner , apparently wishing to go undetected , but unfortunately , she met the Peeves goblin on the road , who tried to seize her opportunity as Fred just for , she chased her away from the castle and attacked her with a stick and a bag of chalk . 
Many students rushed out of the lobby to watch her run away and the owners of the houses prevented them in a half hearted way . 
And indeed , Professor McGonagall sat back in her chair at the table after some weak protest , and it was clear she was expressing regret that she could not run after Umbrige herself , because Peeves herself borrowed her stick . 
Everyone's last evening has come ; Most people had packed up and went down to the farewell party at the end of the school year , but Harry had not even started . " Do it tomorrow ! " Ron was standing at the door of the common bedroom , saying . " Come on , I'm starving . " 
" I ' ll see you quickly , you go away " 
But when the bedroom door closed behind Ron , Harry did not try to pack faster . The last thing he wanted to do was join the Farewell party . 
He worries that Dumbledore will introduce it in his speech . 
It will probably be about Voldemort's comeback ; Anyway he talked about that last year ... 
Harry pulled the crumpled robes out of the bottom of his chest to make room for the neatly folded and found a package wrapped ugly in the corner . 
It can not think of it after it . 
He bent down , pulled it out from under the sneakers and looked at it . 
In a few seconds it recognized what it was . 
Sirius gave it to him right inside the door of the 12 th Grimmauld Square . " When you need me , use it , okay ? " 
Harry plopped down on the bed and opened the package . 
He saw a small square mirror . 
It looks old ; it is really dirty . 
Harry raised it to his face and saw his image in it . 
He flipped the mirror back . 
On the other side there was a scrawl of Serius . 
" This is a two - sided mirror , you have another mirror . 
If you want to tell him , just mention his name ; You will appear in your mirror and you will be able to talk in your mirror . 
James and uncle still use his uncle when we are detained in two separate places . 
Harry's heart began to pound . 
He recalled meeting his parents in the Past Mirror four years ago . 
Now it can talk to Sirius , he knows - He looked around to make sure no one was there ; The bedroom looks really good . 
He looked back at the mirror , put it in front of his trembling hands and spoke loud and clear , " Sirius . " 
Its breath blurs the mirror . 
It even brought the mirror closer , the excitement spreading in it , but the pair was blinking with it over the screen than it was supposed to . 
He wiped the mirror and said , the voice echoed throughout the room : 
" Sirius please come back ! " 
Nothing happens . 
The face was looking at it through its mirror 
Sirius did not carry his mirror as he passed through the archway , a small voice in Harry's head . That's why it did not work . Harry stood there for a moment , then threw the mirror back into the chest and it broke . 
He was persuaded , for a moment to shine , that he would meet again with Serius , to speak to him . Frustration burned his throat ; He got up and started throwing his messy stuff into the chest that covered the broken mirror - 
But a thought came to him with a better thought than a mirror of a greater thought , more important than it had never before thought - why did he never ask ? 
He ran out of the common bedroom and down the spiral staircase ; When running it crashed into the wall without realizing it ; She hurried through the living room without a shadow of her body , through the gap behind the portrait and straight along the corridor , ignoring Mrs. Bean calling to him : " The party is about to begin , you know , well - timed ! " 
But Harry did not intend to attend the party 
What a castle so much when you do not need one , now 
She ran down the stairs and along the corridors without seeing anyone alive or dead . 
All of them , sure , in the hall . came outside the classroom Spellbook suddenly stopped , gasped and disappointed thinking that he should wait until the end of the party 
But when he had just given up hope he saw him - someone in the background drifting across the corridor . 
" Hey - this Nick ! 
NICK ! " 
The ghost pulled his head out of the wall , revealing the furry feathered cap and swaying the head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington . 
" Hello , " he said as he pulled out the rest of his body from the rock and firmly smiled at Harry . " I'm not the only one coming late . 
But , " he sighed with a different attitude , of course 
" Nick , can I ask you ? " 
Astonishment appeared on Nick's face - Near - Loose - head when he put a finger on the neck collar and straightened it a bit , apparently letting himself have time to interrupt . think 
He only stopped when his neck broke off completely . 
" Hey , Harry , " Nick said , looking confused . " Can not wait until after the party ? " 
" No - Nick - please , " said Harry , " I really want to talk to you . 
Can we get in here ? " 
Harry opened the door to the nearest classroom and Nick - Near - End - sighed . 
" Oh , okay , " he said , looking relieved . " I can not pretend I do not expect this . " 
Harry held the door open for him but instead he drifted through the wall . 
" Expect what ? " Harry asked as he closed the door . 
" You came to find me , " Nick said , now gliding over to the window and looking down at the pitch . " It still happens , sometimes when one has to suffer the loss . " 
" Yes , " said Harry , trying not to sag . " He was right , I - I came to find you . " Nick did not say anything . 
" Because - " said Harry , seemingly more embarrassed by the anticipation , " because - he was dead . 
But are you still here ? " 
Nick sighed and continued to look down the yard . 
" That's right , is not it ? " Harry urged him . " He's dead , but I'm talking to him . Could he go around Howarts and everything ? " 
" Yes , " Nick - Near - Death said softly , " I go and say , yes . " 
" So you came back , did not you ? " Harry said urgently . " Can people come back ? 
Like ghosts . 
They do not disappear completely ? right ? 
She was impatient while Nick kept saying nothing . 
Nick - Near - Ends - hesitated for a moment and said , " Not everyone can return like a ghost . " 
" What do you mean ? " Harry said quickly . 
" Only the witches . " 
" Oh , " said Harry , almost laughing out loud with relief . " Good , that's good , the one I ask is a witch . 
So he can come back , right ? " Nick walked away from the window and looked at Harry gloomily . 
" He will not come back . " 
" Ai ? " 
" Sirius Black , " Nick said . 
" But he's back ! " Said Harry furiously . " He came back - he was dead and he did not disappear - " 
" The witches can leave their mark on the ground , to go to where they were when they were alive , " Nick said miserably . " But few witches choose that way . " 
" Why not ? " Said Harry . " Anyway - no matter - Sirius does not care if it's abnormal , he ' ll come back , I know he ' ll ! " 
And with intense conviction , Harry turned his head toward the door , surely , in a split second , he would meet Sirius , pearly and transparent , shining through the door to him . 
" He will not come back , " Nick repeated . " He will go forever . " 
" What do you mean by that ? " Said Harry . 
Listen - what happens when you die ? 
Where did he go ? 
Why do not people turn around ? 
Why there are not many ghosts here ? 
Why ? " 
" I can not answer , " Nick said . 
" You are dead , are not you ? " Harry said in pain . " Who can answer better than you ? " 
" I'm scared of death , " Nick said softly . " I have chosen to remain behind , sometimes I do not know if I am right , not here , as I am not here or there . " He gave a sad smile . " I do not know anything about the secrets of death , Harry , because instead I chose the weak imitation of life . 
I believe the learned witches studied this problem in the Department of Mysteries - 
" Do not tell me about that place ! " said Harry fiercely . 
" I'm sorry no help , " Nick said softly . " Yeah , let me apologize to the party , you know ? " 
And he came out of the room , leaving Harry alone , staring blankly at the wall Nick had vanished . 
Harry felt he almost lost his godfather once again , and no hope he could see and talk to him again . 
He walked slowly and painfully through the empty castle , wondering if he was still happy or not . 
He walked across the corner toward Mrs. Beo's corridor and saw someone in the front who was putting a note on the wallboard . 
A momentary glance tells him it is Luna . 
There was no good hiding place nearby , and she was about to hear the sound of her footsteps , and in any case , Harry could hardly concentrate his energies to hide from anyone . 
" Hello , " Luna said absentmindedly and glanced around as she backed away from the board . 
" You're not at the party , are you ? " Asked Harry . 
" Oh , I lost most of your belongings , " Luna said calmly . ' Everyone took them and hid them , you know . 
But since it's the last night , I really want to get them back , so I have to announce it . " 
She made a move toward the board , where , sure enough , she had a list of her lost books and clothes , with a plea for their return . 
A strange feeling appeared in Harry's head ; Another emotion with the anger and pain filled in it since Sirius's death . 
After a while it realizes that it is sympathetic to Luna . 
" Why can anyone hide your belongings ? 
He asked her seriously . 
" Oh , " she shrugged . ' I think they think you're a bit weird , you know . 
Someone called me Lovegood crazy , really . " 
Harry looked at her and felt more pity . 
" There's no reason for them to get your stuff , " he said bluntly . " You want me to help you find them again ? 
" Oh , no , " she said and smiled at him . " They will come back , they usually do that at the last minute . 
I just want to pack it up tonight . 
Well , why are not you at the party ? " 
Harry shrugged . " Just because you do not feel like it . " 
" No , " Luna said and looked at her with her oddly swollen eyes . " I do not think you do that . 
Who killed you godfather is your godfather right ? 
Ginny told me . " 
Harry nodded curtly , but realized that it was okay as Luna spoke about Sirius . 
He remembers that she could see the Thestral . 
" ever " it started . " I mean , who has ever died ? " 
" Yes , " Luna said softly , " my mother . 
She was an extraordinary witch , you know , but she wanted to experiment and one day her curse was so wrong . 
I was nine years old . " 
" I'm sorry , " Harry muttered . " Yes , it was terrible , " Luna said in a normal voice . " Sometimes I feel very sad about it . 
But I still have dad . 
And anyway , it's not like you ' ll never see me again , right ? " 
" Eh ? " Harry said uncertainly . 
She shakes her head in disbelief . 
" Come on . 
You heard them , right behind the curtain , right ? 
" I mean " 
" In the room was the archway . 
They hid there , that's all . 
I heard them . " 
Two people look at each other . 
Luna smiled gently . 
Harry did not know what to say or what to think ; Luna believed in a lot of unusual things as well as she was sure she had heard the voices behind the curtain . 
" Are you sure you do not need help finding furniture ? " He said . 
" Oh , no , " Luna said . " No , I thought I should go downstairs , eat some pudding , and wait until they come out of the closet , have a nice holiday . " 
" Yeah , you too . " 
She walked away and , as she watched , she found that the terrible weight in her heart seemed to have decreased somewhat . 
The trip back home on the Hogwarts Express train the next day in a way that is memorable . First of all , Malfoy , Crabble and Goyle , who had been waiting for a week without the teacher's help , tried to stop Harry from catching him on the train when he came back from the toilet . 
The attack would have been successful if they did not accidentally choose to attack outside the cavity of countless DA members who witnessed the incident through the glass and immediately stood up to help . help Harry . 
At that time Erine Macmillan , Hannah Abbott , Susan Bones , Justin Finch - Fletchley Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot used a myriad of spells and mantras that Harry had taught them , Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle . Turned into three huge slugs in Hogwarts school clothes when Harry , Ernie and Justin lifted them up on a luggage rack so they dripped water there . " I need to say that I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mother's face when she gets off the train , " Ernie said with some satisfaction as she watched Malfoy crawling over his head . 
Ernie never neglects Malfoy's humiliation when subtracting points from the Hufflepuff when he is a member of the test team . " Mother Goyle will be pleased , " Ron said as he came to find out what the reason was . " The character is better now , anyway , Harry , the food truck is not sure what you want . " 
Harry thanked everyone and followed Ron back to his cabin ; where it bought a large pile of Vaccines and pumpkin pie . 
Hermione was reading the Prophet's diary , Giny was explaining the Pleiadi's letter , and Neville was playing with the Mimbulus mimbletonia , who had grown up a great deal after a year and made some strange whispers . touch . 
Harry and Ron killed the time of the trip by playing the witch's banner while Hermione read aloud from the Prophet . 
Now it's packed with articles on how to get rid of the Dementors , the efforts of the Ministry of Magic to follow the Death Eaters , and the provocative letters that the author has ever seen . Lord Voldemort went through his house that morning 
" It really has not started , " Hermione sighed sadly and folded the newspaper . " But it's not long now . " 
" Hey , Harry , " Ron said gently , nodding toward the glass window overlooking the hallway . 
Harry looked out . 
Cho is passing , followed by Marietta Edgecombe , who is wearing a hood . 
His eyes and Cho's eyes meet for a moment . 
Blush and walk away . 
Harry looked down at the chessboard just in time to see a good soldier being eaten by Ron's statue . 
" Oh , you and her ? " Ron whispered . 
" Nothing , " Harry said honestly 
" I - oh - heard she was going out with someone else , " said Hermione probe . 
Harry was surprised that it did not hurt him at all . The will to impress Cho seems to have belonged to a past that has nothing to do with it ; On these days , much of what he wanted before Sirius's death came so well that it seemed like the last time he'd met Sirius last ; It is located in both worlds , one has a Sirius uncle and one is not . 
" You can leave that , " Ron said firmly . " I mean she looks cute , but you need someone more fun . " 
" For somebody she's definitely happier , " said Harry and shrugged . 
" Who is she going with ? " Ron asked Hermione , but Ginny was the one answering . 
" Michael Corner , " she said . 
" Michael - but , " said Ron , from his chair staring at the girl . 
" But you went out with him ! " 
" Never again , " Ginny said firmly . " He did not like the Gryffindor House defeating the Ravenclaws at Quidditch , and he was really angry , so I abandoned him and instead he ran to Cho to comfort me . " She scratched her nose with the brush of her tail , turned back to the Kindle and began to mark her answers . 
Ron looked satisfied . 
" Yes , I always thought he was a little stupid , " he said , and urged his queen forward in front of Harry's shaking car . " Good for you . 
Just pick another - better - next time . " 
It gives a strange look to Harry as he speaks . 
" Yeah , I picked Dean Thomas , do you think he's better ? " Ginny asked absently . " WHAT ? 
Ron yelled , turning over the board : Crookshanks ran after the chess pieces , Hedwig and Pigwidgeon screaming and screaming angrily above his head . 
As the train slowed to the Crossroads , Harry thought he never wanted to leave . 
He even thought fast of what would happen if he simply refused to get off the train and stubbornly sat there until September , when it would again bring it back to Hogwarts . 
However , when the train finally regurgitated the horn and stopped , it picked up the Hegwid cage and prepared to pull his chest out of the ship as always . 
When the custodian gestures to Harry , Ron and Hermione are safe to walk through the marvelous bar between the nine and ten platforms , they discover a surprise awaiting them on the other side : a group The one who does not expect them to stand there welcomes it . T 
There was Moody - Eyes - madman , who was fierce with his collapsed hat and covered his god's eyes like he did not have it , his bony hand clutching a long , He is wrapped in a traveling cloak . 
Tonks stood behind the teacher , her glowing blonde hair glowing in the sunlight through the dirty glass of the station ceiling , wearing a pair of patched jeans and a shirt Legend of fate Sister fate . Standing next to her Tonks is Lupine , a pale face , gray hair , a long and coats overcoat and a faded pants . In front of everyone is Mr. and Mrs. Weasley , wearing the best Muggle outfit and two guys Fred and George , both wearing a brand new jacket made of something blue and scaly . 
" Ron , Ginny ! " Mrs. Weasley called and ran quickly toward the kids and pinched them tightly 
" Oh , and Harry's in love - are you okay ? " 
" I'm fine , " Harry lied as she pulled it into his embrace . 
Through her shoulder , he saw Ron with his new twin brothers ' shirts . 
" What are they ? " He asked , pointing at the two jackets . 
" Best dragon skin , brother , " Fred said and pulled the lock a bit . " Work is progressing smoothly and we think that we should reward ourselves . " 
" Good morning , Harry , " Lupine said as Mrs. Weasley released it to greet Hermione . 
" Hello , " said Harry . " You do not expect this all to do here ? " 
" Well , " Lupine said with a soft smile , " We think we have to talk a bit to your aunt before letting them take you home . " 
" I do not know if that's a good idea , " Hary said at once . 
" Oh , I think that's true , " said Moody growled and limped closer . " Sure they are not Potter ? " 
He pointed his thumb over his shoulder , his god - eye clearly looking through the back of his head and his bowler hat . 
Harry leaned slightly to the left to see where the Mad - Eye was pointing and there , sure , it was the three Dursleys who looked frightened to see the people picking up Harry . 
" Oh , Harry , " Mrs. Weasley said , and turned to Hermione's parents , who had been welcoming and now clamoring for Hermione . " Right - do we do that now ? " 
" Yes , I suppose so , Arthur , " said Moody . 
Mrs and Mr Weasley led the way down the platform toward the Dursleys , who were now rooted to the ground . 
Hermione softly separated from her mother and entered into the same people . 
" Hello , " Mr. Weasley said cheerfully to Uncle Vernon as he stopped in front of Uncle . " You must remember me , my name is Arthur Weasley " 
When Mr. Weasley had destroyed almost everything in the Dursley living room two years ago , Harry would be surprised if Uncle Vernon could forget him . 
Surely Uncle Vernon was smiling and he was angry at Mr. Weasley , but the Uncle chose not to say , to some extent , perhaps because the Dursleys were two times more in number . 
Aunt Petunia looked both embarrassed and embarrassed ; She looked down on the ground as if she knew someone was going to go with them . 
Meanwhile Dudley seems to be trying to look small and mediocre , something that has failed miserably . 
" We thought we had something to say about Harry , " Mr. Weasley said , still smiling . 
" Yes , " said Moody growled . " About how he was treated when he was grandparents . " 
Uncle Vernon's mustache seemed to stand up with anger . 
Maybe because of the hat 
The melon has created for him a completely false impression that the unborn is confronted with human like stepfather ; He told Moody . 
" I do not think he has anything to do with my house - " 
" I do not think you realize that you will be stuffing some books , Mr. Dursley , " Moody growled . 
" That's not the problem , anyway , " Tonks , who had pink hair , seemed to have made Aunt Petunia more upset than the rest because she closed her eyes instead of looking at her , interrupting . " The problem is , if we find out who treats Harry badly " 
" And do not do anything wrong , we ' ll hear that , " Lupine added cheerfully . 
" Yes , " said Mr. Weasley , " even if you do not let Harry use fellytone . 
" Telephone , " whispered Hermione . " Yes , if we hear anything about Harry being abused in any way , he will have to talk to us , " said Moody . 
Uncle Vernon puffed up . 
The feeling of insult of the stepfather seems to weigh more than the fear of this strange people . 
" Are you scaring me , sir ? " He said , so loud that the passing ones really turned to look . 
" Yes , I'm doing it , " said the Mad - Eye , apparently pleased as Uncle Vernon quickly realized the truth . 
" And do I look like someone who can be threatened ? " Uncle Vernon barked . 
" Yes , " said Moody , and pushed his bowler hat backwards to reveal a fierce , revolting eye . 
Uncle Vernon jumped back in fear and hit a luggage cart . " Yes , I must say that you are so , Mr. Dursley " - 
He turned away from Uncle Vernon and looked at Harry . 
" Harry , call me when you need us . 
If we do not hear from you in three days , we will send someone to " 
Aunt Petunia mourns miserably . 
Obviously , I was thinking about what the neighbors would say if they met these people marching on the aisles in their garden . 
" Well , hello , Potter , " said Mr. Moody and gripped Harry's shoulders for a long time with his bony hand . 
" Remember , Harry , " Lupine whispered . " Remember to contact me . " 
" Harry , we ' ll take you away as soon as possible , " Mrs. Weasley whispered , hugging him again . 
" We ' ll see you soon , " Ron said nervously and shook Harry's hand . 
" Very soon , Harry , " said Hermione seriously . " We promised . " 
Harry nodded . 
For some reason he could not find a word to tell them what it meant to him , to see them standing there beside him . 
Instead , he smiled , waved his hand and turned around and walked out of the station heading for the sunny road with Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia and Dudley following behind .
