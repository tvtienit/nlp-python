Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 
CHAPTER 1 CANCER BOX 
Harry Potter is an unusual kid in many ways . 
One of the abnormalities is that it hates summer , hating more than any other time of the year . 
Another abnormal thing was that he wanted to do his homework , but he had to do it in secret , in the middle of the night . 
And finally , just by chance , it becomes a witch . 
It was almost midnight . 
Harry was lying on his bed , the blanket over his head like a tent , holding a flashlight , a large leather book ( Adabert Waffling ) , opened on the pillow . 
Harry used the tip of the eagle's hair to point to the bottom of the page , frowning for something that could help him write his essay , " Comment on the following : The fourteenth century is completely nonsense . " Harry Potter's pen stops at the beginning of a paragraph . 
He pushed the round glasses on the bridge of the nose , shining a flashlight across the book and reading : In the Middle Ages , the unlicensed ( often called the Muggles ) were afraid of the mysterious , but real They do not know what is real witch , what is false . 
In rare cases where they catch a true witch or a real wizard , burning the witches or mages does not have much effect . 
Witches or wizards only need to kill a Cold Charm - Fire - elemental Charm , and then fake a painful twist , while their true feelings are palatable and very itchy . 
In fact , the witch Wendelin liked to burn so much that she let herself be arrested not less than forty - seven times in different forms of disguise . 
Harry took the eagle feather between his teeth , slid his hand under the pillow , took out the ink bottle and rolled the parchment . 
She opened the ink bottle with care , dipped it with ink and began writing . 
Sometimes it stops writing , listening ear . 
Because if anyone in the Dursley family hears goose feathers fluttering on parchment ( Harry walks through Harry's bedroom to get to the toilet ) , then Harry dares to be trapped again in the bedroom . roam the stairs until the end of the summer . 
The Dursleys lived in Privet Drive No . 4 . 
These people are the reason why Harry never enjoyed the summer holidays . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and their son , Dudley , are the only surviving relatives of Harry . 
They are Muggles . 
And they have medieval attitudes to the occult . 
Under the roof of the Dursleys , it is forbidden to talk to Harry's deceased parents , because they are witches and wizards . 
For years , Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that , if they tried to suppress Harry , they could expel the mysterious power from the boy . 
But eventually they just went crazy because they never failed , and now they live in horror as the risk that someone knows that Harry has been studying for two years at the School of Magic and Magic Hogwarts ... the best thing the Dursleys could do these days was to lock Harry's witches , wands , cauldrons and broomsticks early in the summer , and ban Harry from talking to him . neighborhood . 
For Harry , being deprived of the charms was a real pain , because the teacher at Hogwarts had given him a bunch of holiday work . 
One of the essays that Harry had to write was an extremely difficult subject to the most potent drug outlets in the Hogwarts School , Mr. Snape . 
This man earned an excuse for a ban on Harry for about a month , he was very happy . 
So , right in the first week of summer vacation , Harry enlisted a chance . 
At that time , Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley were all around the front yard to admire Uncle Vernon's brand new car . ( Car sound to know , perhaps throughout the street to pay attention ) . 
Harry had the opportunity to sneak into the house , the lock of the room under the stairs , snapping his textbooks , hiding in the bedroom . 
As long as it keeps the sheets clean , without any ink marks , the Dursleys are far from knowing that it still examines the magic at night . 
Harry is also keen to avoid complicating matters with his aunts at the moment , because they are already bothered by it , just because of the phone call of a sorcerer at Hogwarts School - Ron early summer . 
Ron Weasley is a family of witches . 
That means Ron knows a whole lot of things Harry does not know , but it also means that Ron never uses the phone . 
Bad luck is the first time Ron calls the phone pickers answered it is Uncle Vernon . " Mr. Vernon Dursley is talking here . " At that moment , Harry was in the room , listening to the loud rumbling of Ron from the stethoscope . 
I - WANT - SAY - STORY - WITH - HARRY - POTTER ! " Ron screamed so loud that Uncle Vernon jumped out of the phone , holding the stethoscope . From his ear to three inches , he glared at the stethoscope with a bewildered look on his face . " Uncle Vernon ? " Uncle Vernon turned to the phone and shouted , " WHAT ARE YOU ? " As if he and Uncle Vernon were standing at the ends of the stadium talking to each other . " RON WEASLEY , I ' LL BE YOUR FRIEND OF HARRY IN SCHOOL ... " Uncle Vernon's little eyes turned a circle to Harry : " HARRY NOTHING HERE ! " Harry stood there . 
Uncle Vernon was yelling at the phone that he held in his left hand , as if afraid that it might explode at any moment : " I DO NOT KNOW THE SCHOOL WHERE YOU ARE SAYING NEXT ! CONTACT US AND NEVER COME TO YOUR FAMILY . " The tossed phone dropped the phone on the table as if to throw away a dead spider . 
The next match was an unprecedented fight between the two . 
Uncle Vernon roared with Harry , splashing water into Harry's face : 
" WHY DOES THE DAY GET A PHONE NUMBER FOR THE PEOPLE ... 
AS YOU ? " Obviously Ron knew it had caused Harry trouble , so he did not see it calling again . 
Harry's best friend at Hogwarts School , Hermione Granger , did not hear a thing . 
Harry suspected Ron warned Harmione not to call . 
If so , then , unfortunately , because Hermione , the smartest scholar of Harry's class , is a Muggle - girl , she's too used to using the phone , and also understands when it comes to calling the Dursleys . Do not say anything about Hogwarts . 
So , Harry did not receive any news from his wizarding friends during the first five weeks of the holiday . 
This summer turned out to be just as bad as last summer , Harry totally lost his friend's credibility . 
Just a little more , a little bit : after solemnly swearing it would not use the Hedwig owl to send a letter to any of his friends , Harry was allowed to drop Hedwig out at night . 
Uncle Vernon's concession was because he could not continue to suffer the loud bustle that Hedwig caused when locked in the cage . 
Harry finished writing the text of the Wendelin Witch , who stopped , listened to the static . 
The dark house sank in silence , only shaking lightly every time his cousin Harry Dudley snarled . 
It must have been late . 
Harry's eyes were itching with tiredness . 
Maybe let's go tomorrow night to write this thesis , he thought ... 
Harry covered the ink bottle , pulled out a pillowcase from under the bed , dropped it all : a flashlight , a " Page of Magecraft , " his essay , along with a pen and ink bottle , pillow case 
He climbed down onto the bed , hiding all the " hinges " under a broken floorboard , under the bed . 
Then he stood up and stretched his shoulder muscularly , looking at the luminous clock on his bedside table . 
one o ' clock in the morning . 
" Harry laughed with a laugh . 
So it was already thirteen years old , and it was not good . That's another unusual thing about Harry : he's not looking forward to his birthday like any other kid . 
His life has never received a birthday card . 
Repeating the two birthdays last year and one year ago , Dursley's aunt was completely oblivious , so Harry had no reason to expect them to remember her birthday today . 
Harry walked across the dark room , across the empty cage of Hedwig , to the open window . 
He leaned against the windowsill , letting the cool night's air , the refreshing feeling after a long night's sleep in the blanket . 
Hedwig lost two nights . 
Usually , Harry does not care about the owl : he has been away for a few days now . 
But now Harry expects Hedwig to come back . 
Because it's the only creature in this house that does not fall apart when confronted by Harry . 
Although he is still a bit younger and younger than his age , Harry is a bit taller than last year . 
His black hair is still the same as ever : mischievously ugly , no matter how busy he brushes off . 
After the eyes are very bright eyes , blue color , and on the forehead is a thin lightning scar , can be seen clearly under the hair wax coating . 
This is the most unusual thing in Harry's life . It was not the " anniversary " of a car crash that left Harry's cheeks dead , as Dursley's aunt had for the last ten years . 
Harry's lads , James and Lily Potter , have never died of a car accident , they have been warned by the darkest sorcerer of the Dark side for a hundred years . 
Voldemort assassinated . 
Harry escaped , leaving only a small scar on his forehead . 
Now , standing on the window looking out into the dark , Harry remembered his most recent encounter with Voldemort . 
It must be acknowledged that it is alive to this thirteenth birthday is a blessing . 
Harry stared at the starry sky to find the silhouette of Hedwig , knowing that the owl was about to return to his master , with a dead rat in his beak , 
While looking absent - mindedly around the house , there appeared something above the rooftops - something that took seconds after Harry realized what it was . 
The shadow on the background of the golden moon is a crooked creature , and the creature is flapping its wings toward Harry , as the image becomes clearer and louder in the sky . 
Harry stood there for a moment , looking at the animal at a moment's notice . 
He hesitated for half a second , his hands on the window sill , wondering if he should close the door or not . 
But just then , the bizarre creature dashed past the lights of Privet Drive , and Harry immediately recognized what that was . 
She jumped aside . 
Three owls pierced the window , exactly two owls who seemed to have lost consciousness . 
The group landed on Harry's chest , the owl was centered in the middle of the hill and was straight . 
It was a great gray owl , at the bottom of it was tied up with a great package . 
Harry recognized the unconscious owl . 
Its name is Errol - the owl of the Weasley family . 
Instantly , Harry rushed to the bed , unfastened the strap around Errol's legs , unpacked the package , and brought Errol to Hedwig's stable . 
Errol opened his dim eyes , uttered a weak grunt to express gratitude , and took a few sips of water . 
Then Harry turned to the other two owls . 
One of them - the snow - white one - is Harry's Hedwig . 
It also carries a gift package , which looks quite positively on its own merits . 
Harry hugged Harry a few gently as Harry removed the " achievement " from his leg . 
Finished , she flew across the room to have fun with Errol . 
Harry did not recognize the third child - a pretty brown owl . 
But Harry knew where this owl came from , because in addition to the third gift , he also carried a letter bearing the Hogwarts badge . 
When Harry unloaded the weight of the dispatch , it solemnly ruffled , flattened its wings , and threw a fly through the window , dashing into the night . 
Harry sat down on the bed , grabbed the package Errol brought , stripped the brown paper wrapped outside . 
Inside , under another layer of gold , it explores a gift wrapped with a birthday card - a card that Harry first received in his life . 
With trembling fingers , Harry opened the envelope . 
Two pieces of paper fell out , a letter and a piece of paper cut from the newspaper . 
Obviously the piece was cut from the Daily Prophet , because the people in the black and white picture were stirring . 
Harry took the piece of cut paper , smoothed it out and read : MEMBERSHIP OF THE LARGE PRIZE MEMBER Arthur Weasley , Muggles Chief Operating Officer of the Ministry of Magic , has just won the Lotto Grand Prize . Galleon of the Prophet Daily . 
Mr. Weasley said cheerfully to the Prophet : " We will spend the gold on the summer holidays in Egypt , where our eldest son , Bill , is working as a solicitor for the bank . Gringotts witch . " 
The Weasley family will spend one month in Egypt , and return at the start of the new school year at Hogwarts , where the five Weasley children are currently enrolled . 
Harry stared at the merry figure , his mouth pouting as he saw all nine of the Weasleys standing in front of a huge pyramid waving at him violently . 
Come on , Mrs Weasley , a little kid who's chubby , and bald , weasley , six boys and a daughter . 
Although the photograph was black and white , Harry could imagine the nine hairs of all nine of his family were red . Standing in the center of the picture was Ron , tall , lanky , with a rat scabbard on his shoulder , an arm around Ron's sister Ginny . 
The Weasley family was extremely kind but extremely poor , so Harry found no one better than them to be rewarded for such a pile of gold . 
He picked up Ron's letter , opening it : " Dear Harry , Happy Birthday ! 
You know , I really regret the phone call . 
I hope the Muggle family does not make you stand up . 
I said three , said he should not have shouted in the phone so . 
In Egypt this is all over the place . 
Bill took us around the graves . 
You can not imagine the curse that Egyptian witches have on these graves . So much so that I dared not let Ginny into the last gravestone to visit . 
In this grave there are deformed skeletons , heard of Muggle intruders and then grow up more or more such . 
I could not believe it when he hit the lottery lottery of the Prophet Daily . 
Those seven hundred Galleon gold ! 
Most of the gold has been spent on this trip , but the parents still have enough to buy a new wand for the next school year . " Harry remembered so much about the flying car crash that made Ron's old wand tear . " His family will return before the start of the new school year . and we will go to London to buy new books and wands for ourselves . 
Are there any chances to meet you there ? Do not let the Muggle dies ! 
Find a way to London ! 
Ron P . Percy was elected Student Leader . New photos received newsletters last week . " Harry glanced at the picture again . 
Percy will be in her seventh year , the last year , at Hogwarts . 
He looks extremely chic . 
The male student badge was put on the red Turkish hat very nicely on the smooth hair straightening . 
his horns reflecting the sunshine of Egypt . 
Harry just turned to the other gifts , began to remove the wrapping paper . 
Ron's gift pack was an item that looked like a miniature glass of figurine . 
Accompany this gift with another letter from Ron : " Harry , this is a pocket - sized tearoom . 
If someone around you does not trust it , it will light up and spin . 
Mr. Bill said it was bullshit , to sell to wacky and unreliable tourists , because when the whole family was having dinner last night , it kept glowing . 
It was because he did not notice that George and Fred had taken away the soup of the bugs . 
Goodbye home . 
" Harry put his pockettag on the bedside table . 
The tent - pole lens rests on top of the head for a very balanced way , reflecting the luminous needle . 
Harry looked at Ron's gift pleasantly for seconds , then picked up the package that Hedwig had brought home . 
Inside this package is also a carefully wrapped gift , a card and a letter . 
All of Hermione's letters : Dear Harry , Ron wrote to me and told me about her phone call to Uncle Vernon . 
I hope you are still well . 
Now I'm on vacation in France and I do not know how to send this letter to you - If they open the letter in Customs then I know how ? 
- Thank you , Hedwig appeared just in time . 
Hedwig wants to make sure you have a different birthday present every year . 
I bought a gift by ordering with a owl . 
There is an ad in the Daily Prophet ( I have placed a long - term order for home delivery , so it is up to date what is happening in the wizarding world , is interesting . ) picture of Ron and his family in the newspaper out a week ago ? 
I bet he learned the whole story interesting or interesting , I really play envy - the ancient Egyptian witch is certainly very attractive . 
There is also some interesting local magical history . 
I have rewritten my entire Magisterial History essay to add to what I have just discovered . 
I hope my essay is not so long , it is only longer than the request of Professor Binns has two rolls of parchment only . 
Ron said he was going to London for the last week of summer . 
Can you go ? 
Will your aunt give you a go ? 
I really hope you can go . 
If not , we ' ll wait until we meet on the Hogwarts Express on September 1 ! 
Sincerely , Hermione . 
PS : Mr. Percy has become the leader of the Boys . 
I assure you that Percy is enjoying it . 
But Ron did not seem happy about this . 
Harry grinned again as Hermione's letter passed to open her gift . 
It's a bit heavy . 
Hermione knew too well , Harry was sure it would be a huge book filled with extremely difficult spells . 
But it turned out not to be . 
Harry's heart thudded as it ripped open the sheet of paper to reveal a smooth black box with silver letters printed on the lid : " The preserve of the broom . " 
Harry whispered , " Wow , Hermione ! " He pulled the zipper up to open the box and looked inside . 
There is a large Fleetwood chopper bowl , a pair of bright silver brushstrokes , a tiny copper compass for broomsticks for long journeys , and a Handbook . Self - Protection - Spirit Broom . 
In addition to friends , what makes Harry remember Hogwarts is Quidditch , the subject 
most popular in the witch world . 
The sport in which the player had to ride the ball was quite dangerous , but it was a thrill and Harry was by chance the youngest player to play for any of Hogwarts ' last century . 
One of the rewards it receives thanks to Quidditch talent is a Nimbus 2000 broom . 
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up the last gift . 
He immediately recognized the zigzag pattern on the brown paper : anyone else than Hagrid , the Hogwarts keeper . 
He hastily rips the top of the package to look at the inside in an eager way . 
That " skin " and green . 
But Harry did not even remove the outer layer of wrapping paper , then the object inside was up one hour . 
I do not know what it is , just know it is clamping , as if the mouth must be so . 
Harry felt chilly . 
He knew that Hagrid had never intentionally sent anything dangerous : yet Hagrid had no view and perception of ordinary people as to what was dangerous , what was not . 
Everyone knows that old Hagrid was friends with giant spiders , bought a fierce three - headed dog at a pub , and illegally smugged an egg in his hut . 
Harry tensed the package tensely . 
The package was fussy . 
Harry reached out and took hold of the lamp on his bedside table , holding it firmly in one hand , holding it over his head , ready to light the lamp in the wrap that he was tearing . 
Harry pulled that thing away , and from the wrapper was a book . 
Just barely recognizing the beautiful blue cover with the gold lettering of the book title : " The Monsters of Monsters , " the bizarre book was jumping on the spine and the cork Through Harry's bed , like a monstrous crab . 
Harry whispered : " Come on ! " The book fell off the bed , causing a loud thud , and then hurried across the room . 
Harry stalked it . 
The book underneath the table , hiding in a dark area . 
As Dursley was sleepy for the whole of the house , he could barely hear the noise , and Harry crawled to the floor , trying to reach for the table and pull the book out . " Ui da ! " The book bent his hand and then ran over Harry , still wandering through the book and the spine . 
Harry struggled around , leaning forward , leaning over , trying to force the book down for it lying still . In the next room , Uncle Vernon snaked up an echo of thunder . 
While Harry struggled to hold on to the struggling book , Hedwig and Errol looked pleasantly surprised . 
Once Harry had grabbed the book , Harry rushed to the drawer with a drawer , pulled out a string , and tied the book carefully . 
The Monster Beast with anger , but no longer clapping or patted the cover of the book . 
Finished , Harry tossed the bizarre book on the bed , with Hagrid's hand holding the card : Harry remember , happy birthday ! 
He thought this book would be useful for him at the next school year . 
Now I do not say anything more . 
As long as you meet him , he will say . 
Hope the Muggles treat you well . 
Wish you all good , Uncle Hagrid . 
Harry was distraught when Hagrid suggested that a bloated book would be useful , sounding like a scam . 
But it also placed Hagrid's greeting card at Ron's and Hermione's greeting cards , brimming with laughter as ever . 
Now there is only the letter from Hogwarts . 
Harry noticed that the letter was a bit thicker than usual . 
He tore the envelope , pulled out the first parchment and read : Dear Potter , Please note that the new school year will begin on September 1 . 
Hogwarts Express will depart from Nine Three Fourth Station at King's Cross Station , at eleven . 
Third year students will be allowed to visit Hogsmeade Village on a few weekend days . 
Please show the enclosed application form to the parent or guardian . 
Sincerely , Professor McGonagall Vice Principal . 
Harry drew out a form that allowed him to visit the village of Hogsmeade , looking at the parchment for a moment , the smile on his face slowly closing . 
It's a pleasure to visit the village of Hogsmeade at weekends . 
Harry knew that it was a witch village , and the whole village was a witch , but it never came . 
The problem is how to make Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon sign this permit ? 
Harry looked up at the alarm clock . 
It's two o ' clock in the morning . 
She decided to wake up in the morning to worry about the application to visit Hogsmeade . 
But now he climbed into bed , leaned across the bed to cross out a day on his self - made calendar , counting down the days left over for a long summer , looking forward to returning to Hogwarts . 
Then Harry removed his eyes , lay down , his eyes still wide , looking at three birthday cards on the table . 
Although Harry Potter is unusual in every way , this moment Harry Potter feels like any other normal kid : happy today is his birthday , this is the first time In that lifetime Harry had that pleasure . 
CHAPTER 2 THE GREATER OF MARGE 
The next morning , when Harry went down to eat breakfast , he saw all three of the Dursleys sitting there in the kitchen table . 
People are watching television . 
The brand new washing machine just remove the label is a happy gift - for - summer vacation for Dudley . 
Harry's cousin did not stop complaining about how long it had gotten from the refrigerator in the kitchen to the television in the living room . 
Now Dudley almost always in the kitchen almost all summer days . 
His tiny pig eyes kept glued to the small screen , and his chin was staggering and his chin was constantly swinging due to constant munching . 
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon , a tall man like a cow with a tiny neck and a great mustache . 
Not having congratulated Harry for a happy birthday , some of the Dursleys did not even show any sign of Harry's coming into the room . 
But Harry was too familiar with this estrangement , so it was not too sad . 
He gave himself a piece of toast and looked up at the reader in the television . 
He was half - narrating the story of an imprisoned prisoner . 
" Please be aware that Black is armed and extremely dangerous . 
A special hotline has been set up , and people should immediately report to the authorities when they see any evidence of Black . Uncle Vernon lifted his eyes from the newspaper , staring at the prisoner on the screen , snorting : " What the hell is going on ? 
Look at the looks of it is know , lazy garbage ! 
Look at the head of his hair ! " Uncle threw a look at Harry . 
His messy hair was always the source of Uncle Vernon's discomfort . 
However , Harry found it also groomed tasteless if compared to the man's appearance on the television screen . 
He had a haggard face hidden behind his tangled , dull hair , long elbows . 
" The Secretary of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today ... " Uncle Vernon shouted , glaring at him with anger . TV host : " Uh ? 
Come on ! 
Why do not you tell people that crazy guy has passed from prison ? What do you mean offshore ? 
That crazy madman is hanging out on the street now ! " Aunt Petunia gasped around the room , staring out through the kitchen window . 
She has a bony body and a long face . 
Harry knew Aunt Petunia just wanted to be the hotline dialer to secretly inform the prisoner of escape . 
She is the most prized woman in the world and spent most of her life watching her neighbors bored to obey strictly the law . 
Uncle Vernon waved a handful of purple on his desk and said , " I do not know when they will realize that for those people there is only one way to hang them ! " " Aunt Petunia followed her husband right away , his eyes still fluttering through the neighbors ' sticks . 
Uncle Vernon cupped his tea and glanced at his watch , adding , " You have to go now , Petunia , Marge's train will arrive at ten o ' clock . " , Harry is suddenly dragged to the ground when he heard the words of Uncle Vernon . 
He said , " Miss Marge ? 
Do you ... come here ? " Marge is Uncle Vernon's sister . 
Although she does not have the bloodline to Harry , Harry is still forced to call Miss Marge her for life . 
Marge lives in the countryside , in a house in the middle of a large garden . 
In that garden , she raised a Bun dog . 
Often she would not stay at Uncle Vernon's house very much , because she could not stand the distance away from her precious dogs . 
But her sparse visits were enough to keep Harry in deep horror . 
Remembering Dudley's fifth birthday , Marge had bent down Harry's two shins to stop him touching the statue that made Dudley's music . 
A few years later , Marge appeared at Christmas , giving Dudley a computerized machine , and Harry was giving her a box of dog cookies . 
On the most recent visit of Miss Marge , about a year before Harry entered Hogwarts School , Harry accidentally stepped on foot of the dog that Marge dear . 
The Ripper dog chased Harry around the garden , and forced Harry to climb up the tree . 
Marge did not even bother calling the dog to let him go . 
Harry was forced to sit on the tree until midnight . 
Things that until now are still a laughing stock for Dudley . 
Uncle Vernon snarled , " Marge will stay here for a week . " Uncle Harry's fist - fingered scowls threatened : " And here I am , I need to tell you something , before me . Pick her up . " Dudley took his eyes off the television screen , smirking and smirking . 
For Dudley , the most entertaining way to see his father , Dursley , was to torture his cousin Harry . 
Uncle Vernon snarled . " First of all , if you talk to Marge , do not you think so ? " Harry said sourly , " Well , if she speaks kindly when she speaks . " As if not hearing Harry's answer , Uncle Vernon continued , " Secondly , Marge knows nothing about your abnormalities , so I do not want to have any ... Any funny thing that happened when she was here , you're a soul to behave , do not you ? " Harry clenched his teeth and said , " I ' ll treat you well if your neck is okay . " Uncle Vernon was only two small lines on his red face . " And thirdly , we told Marge that you were studying in the " St . Brutus Center for Detention of Anglicanism . " Harry shouted . " What ? Uncle Vernon snapped , " You have to accept that story , you can not hear me baby , if you do not have a good conversation ! " Harry sat there , white - faced , angry , glared at Vernon , unable to believe what he had heard . 
Marge will be staying at this house for a week , no more bad birthday present that the Dursleys could give to the orphaned grandchild , even compared to the old Uncle Vernon stockings that Harry received . is on its twelfth year anniversary . 
Uncle Vernon stood up , telling his wife and children , " Well , I'm going to the station , Petunia . 
Do you want to go play , Dudley - right ? "" Coughing . " Dudley saw his father horrified him , and he ended up catching up with what he said , turning back to the television screen . 
Aunt Petunia stroked his blonde hair and said , " Dudley must be courteous enough to welcome Marge . 
She bought a cute new bow for me . Uncle Vernon cradled himself on Dudley's shoulder : " Soon , I ' ll see you again ! " was sitting in a state of dread , Harry suddenly came up with a sudden idea . 
Dropping her toast , Harry hurried up to Uncle Vernon to the door . 
Uncle Vernon , wearing a coat of dirt , drove up to see Harry standing on his side , his dagger outstretched : " I'm not going to take you anywhere ! " Harry said coldly : " Like I want to go ! 
I just want to ask one thing . Uncle Vernon looked at him suspiciously . 
Harry said , " Third - year students at Hog School ... at my school , are allowed to visit the village occasionally . " " So what ? " Uncle Vernon gasped , his stepfather holding the car key . Trough the hook near the door . 
" I need your signature on the petition , " said Harry , laughing . " Why do I have to sign ? " Harry carefully picked up every word . It is hard to pretend to Marge that she is studying at the school ... 
Something ... " Uncle Vernon screamed : " St . Brutus Center for Detaining Deficits Infant . " Harry was pleased to hear that in Uncle Vernon's voice there was some panic . 
He calmly looked up at Vernon's pale and unruly face , saying , " Well , that school , I find myself going to have to memorize a lot , and then make the story seem convincing , is not it ? 
If you risk to accidentally reveal something ... " Uncle Vernon roared : " Then I will give you vomit all the things you swallowed , do not you ? Uncle Vernon leaned forward , fist in Harry's face , but Harry was still resilient . 
She spoke in unmovable voice . 
" There was no vomiting for Marge to forget what she was going to say to her neck , " Uncle Vernon paused , his fists still rising , his face red , which had fallen into color . brown cockroach ugly . 
Harry quickly said , " But if you sign up for a petition , I swear I will remember the name of the school that he says he is studying . 
And you will act like a Mug ... , a normal person , and everything . " Harry knew that Uncle Vernon was rethinking his proposal , even though his teeth were jerking and the blood vessels in his temples fluttered . 
Finally he roared : " okay . 
I will carefully watch your attitude behavior during Marge's time here . 
If you keep the story secret and end up in the limit , then I ' ll sign your damn bill . Uncle Vernon turned , pulled the front door , stepped out , and slammed the door shut , 
So strong that one of the glass doors on the high floor was shaken , falling . 
Harry did not return to the kitchen . 
He went straight up the stairs to his bedroom . 
If it had to act like a Muggle , it would be good to start now . 
Harry slowly and sadly collected his birthday presents and greetings , hidden beneath the broken floorboard , in the same place with his unfinished work . 
Then Harry went to the Hedwig cage . 
The Weasley owl - Errol - seems to have recovered a little more , sleeping in his lap next to Hedwig , snuggling under the wings . 
Harry sighed , then woke both of them up . 
Harry said sadly to the owl , " Hedwig , you have to go somewhere for a week . 
Just follow Errol , Ron will take care of you for me . 
I will write a letter to Ron , explain this . 
You do not look at me that way . " Hedwig's big amber eyes were full of blame . 
But Harry continued , " I'm sorry , I know . 
But that was the only way I could get a permit to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione . " Ten minutes later , Errol and Hedwig ( wearing Harry's letter at his feet ) broke through the window and disappeared . 
Harry , with a heavy heart of misery and loneliness , had taken away the empty cage in the closet . 
But Harry did not have much time to brood over . 
Not once did he hear Petunia's thunderous voice call up the stairs , calling Harry down to prepare to welcome guests coming . 
As Harry stuck his head in the corridor , Aunt Petunia scurried out : " Do something with your head ! " Harry did not see any good reason to brush his head smoothly . 
Marge liked it very much , so it looked smarter and it made the neck more fun . 
At that moment , the crunch of the wheel grinded on the gravel outside when Uncle Vernon won the car in the parking lot . 
Then the car door open , the footsteps on the path through the garden . 
Aunt Petunia whispered to Harry , " Open the door ! " Harry pulled open the door , feeling his stomach fill with an indescribable sorrow . 
Marge stood in the doorway . 
She looked exactly like Vernon : she was as big as a pupa , purple , even Marge had a mustache , though not as thick as Vernon's mustache . 
One of Marge's hands was carrying a large suitcase , while the other handing a bulky old dog . 
Marge exclaimed : " Where's your dudley ? 
Where is your beloved pet ? " Dudley stepped out into the corridor , her blond hair brushed against her fat - filled head , and a ribbon under her chin . 
Marge shoved Harry's large suitcase , flipped it aside , grabbed Dudley in a tight hug with one hand , and gave Dudley a big kiss on Dudley's cheeks . 
Harry knew that Dudley would let Marge hug it because it was paid 
little to do this . 
Certainly , when Marge let go of it , Dudley clutched a brand new twenty - pound note . 
Marge strode across Harry's face as if it were just a cone rack . 
" Petunia ! " Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed , or perhaps more correctly , Miss Marge's jawline and Petunia's bony cheekbone touched the " jug " . 
Uncle Vernon stepped in , smiling happily shut the door . 
He said , " Drink tea , Marge ? 
What does Ripper drink ? " Marge said , " The ripper can use some tea on his fork . " The Dursleys dragged themselves into the kitchen , leaving Harry alone in the corridor with the suitcase . 
But Harry did not complain at all , any excuses that prevented him from having to share a spot with Marge were nice to him . 
So he began to gratify the suitcase up the stairs , with no room for the guest bedroom , as many hours as possible . 
When she got back to the kitchen , she saw Miss Marge tea and fruit cake , while the Ripper was resting in the corner , panting its ration . 
Harry saw Petunia grimace , slightly , as the tea and spittle of the dog splashed open on the floor of her clean kitchen . 
Aunt Petunia is the god of animals . 
Uncle Vernon asked , " Are the dogs at home sending Marge ? " Marge broke in with a loud voice , " Oh , I'm asking Colonel Fubster to manage them for me . 
Now he's retired , so it's good for him to work for him . 
But you can not leave the old Ripper at home . 
It's far from me , it's so much worse . " Ripper started to grow as Harry sat down . 
This , in turn , drew Marge's attention to Harry , for the first time since her arrival . 
She said loudly , " What ? 
Are you still here " Harry said , " Yes . " Marge growled , " do not say the word " yes " in that ungrateful voice ! 
Brother Vernon and Petunia were kind enough to contain you . 
Tao does not do that . 
If you were abandoned at the door of my house at that time , you would have been thrown into the orphanage . " Harry was nearly bursting with the idea that he'd rather live in an orphanage than live with the Dursleys . 
But he thought of the application to visit the village of Hogsmeade that dragged down . 
She squeezed a painful smile . 
Marge exclaimed , " You do not laugh at me like that . 
I see you have not been any better since the last time I met you . 
That school must give you a lesson on how to behave properly ! " Miss Marge took a sip of her tea , wiped her mustache , and said , " Vernon , you told me what school you sent it to ? Uncle Vernon immediately replied : " St . Brutus . 
The highest level of correctional education is for those who no longer hope to improve . " Marge nodded . " So that's it ! " 
She suddenly said , " Are they using sticks in St . Brutus's school ? " " Oh ... " Behind Marge's back , Uncle Vernon nodded to Harry in a threatening manner . 
" Yes , yes , " said Harry . Then Harry thought that he should also be more active in what was going on , and added , " Always use sticks . " Marge exclaimed . Excellent ! 
I never have the slightest nonsense feeling that I should not use a whip with a whip . 
A blow is necessary in ninety - nine cases over a hundred . 
Do they often beat you ? " Harry said , " Yes . 
hit many times . " Marge narrowed her eyes . 
She said , " I still do not like your voice , boy . 
If you can talk about sexually assaulting , then obviously they have not given you enough taste . 
Sister Petunia , if you are sister , then I write to them . 
It should be made clear that you fully accept the maximum violence in the case of this child . " Maybe at that moment , Uncle Vernon worried that Harry could forget the bargain between Harry and Uncle , and suddenly the subject suddenly changed the subject : " Marge , have you heard the news this morning ? 
How did the prisoners escaped from the fugitives ? " When Marge felt at home unconcerned Vernon at home , Harry realized that it was desperate for life at the No . 4 Privet Drive at Miss Marge . 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia often encouraged Harry to keep out of sight , but Harry was happy to do so . 
But Marge , on the other hand , wants to keep an eye on Harry wherever he goes , so that she can break even more offerings . 
She was happy to compare Harry and Dudley , and enjoyed the great joy of buying Dudley expensive gifts , while her eyes glared at Harry , as if he dared ask why it was not . gift . 
As such , she constantly throws out the dark hint of what makes Harry so disgruntled . 
At lunch of the third day , Marge said , " Brother Vernon , he becomes so irresponsible that you should not blame yourself . 
When something rotten from the bowel , no one can do anything . " Harry tried to concentrate his food , but his hands were shaking and his face was hot with anger . 
She said to herself , " Remember the permission . 
Think of Hogsmeade . do not say anything 
do not protest . " Marge reached for the glass of wine . 
" It's one of the basic breeding principles . 
People always find that in dogs . 
Anyhow , the puppies spoil ... " At that moment , the glass of wine in Marge's hand suddenly exploded , shattering . 
The spoonful of flying glass went all the way , and Marge blinked , stuttering , her rosy face twinkling with wine . 
Aunt Petunia screamed , " Miss Marge ! 
Miss Marge , are you all right ? " Marge just wiped his face with a napkin and said , " Do not worry ! 
It seems I have squeezed my hand too hard . 
The same thing happened at Col . Fubster's house . 
There is no need to be so fussy as Petunia . 
I have a very strong hold of glasses ... " But both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at Harry suspiciously . 
So it was decided not to eat the tea and leave the table as soon as possible . 
Out to the corridor , Harry leaned against the wall and took a deep breath . 
It's been such a long time since it can unconsciously erupt something when it loses control . 
But now it is impossible to let that happen again . 
The application for a visit to the village of Hogsmeade has yet to be signed by Uncle Vernon . 
But that's just a small thing - if it continues to explode like that , it's going to get big trouble with the Ministry itself . 
Harry is still a minor witch , and according to witch law it is forbidden to magick outside the school . 
And it has violated the law , the criminal record is not very white . 
Just last summer , Harry had received a warning clearly stating that if the Ministry of Magic had any more magical cases on Privet Drive , Harry would certainly be kicked out of Hogwarts . 
Harry heard the people in the Dursley house leaving the table . 
He rushed upstairs to his room to avoid touching them . 
For the next three days , Harry lived through the tails by forcing himself to think only about the Self - Defense Bible , when Marge began to torture him . 
This book is quite effective , although it makes Harry seem dull , so Marge begins to change her voice as she is mentally deficient . 
Finally , it was finally the evening that ended Marge's visit to the Dursleys . 
Aunt Petunia cooks a great dinner and Uncle Vernon unveils a bottle of wine . 
Everyone enjoyed the soup and salmon without worrying about Harry's shortcomings . 
Uncle Vernon started talking about his drilling company , Grunnings , causing everyone to get upset . 
Then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of spirits . 
" Can you have another drink , Marge ? " Marge drank a lot of wine . 
Her big face was red . 
She chuckled : " A little glass again . 
Add a little more ... a little more ... okay then . " Dudley had eaten a fourth cake . 
Aunt Petunia sipped her coffee , the little finger of her left hand was pointed . 
Harry really wanted to go to his room , but he caught Uncle Vernon's angry eyes and he knew it was a good idea to sit back and wait . 
" Wow ! " Marge exclaimed , puffing her lips and putting a glass of spirits on the table , " great food , Petunia . 
Normally , in the evening I only eat fried foods , I see ... I am busy with dust bags with twelve dogs to take care of ... " She buried a large , rubbed the belly under the class ruffled wool . 
" Sorry . 
But actually , I like watching a big , healthy baby . " 
Marge winked at Dudley , continuing to say , " You're going to be a standard size man , Dudley , just like my daddy . 
Oh , Vernon , there's plenty of room left for the beer to go - " Marge nodded to Harry , saying , " There's this little boy ... " Harry's stomach tightened . . 
He immediately thought of the Self - Protecting Handbook . 
" This baby looks small , evil . 
Just like dogs . 
Last year I sent a letter to Colonel Fubster . 
Just a mouse . 
Weak . 
Poor lineage . " Harry tried to recall the twelfth page of the book , " A Spell of Unrequited Opposition . "" After all , bloody , as I have said before . 
Bad blood must be removed . 
Hey , I do not say anything offensive to your family , Petunia . " Marge patted Petunia's bony hand with a big hand like a shovel . 
" But your sister is an egg . 
They belong to the most prestigious families . 
Then she wrapped up with the boy , according to a wandering wacko , leaving the consequences of debt before our eyes . " Harry glared at his food plate . 
Its earlobe fires oddly . 
Harry tried to distract himself by thinking , " Grab your brushes . " 
But it can not remember what's next . 
Marge's voice whirred in the same way as Uncle Vernon's drill . 
Marge grabbed a bottle of spirits , poured more of her glass , shot up on the tablecloth , her voice louder : " This Potter , it made nothing empty , I never told you " Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia looked nervous , so much so that Dudley stopped his face and left his mouth open and gazed at his old man . 
Uncle Vernon glanced his eyes at Harry again and said , " It's ... not working . 
Unemployment . " Marge nodded . " Just as I thought . " She drank a glass of bran - and then wiped her chin with her sleeves : " An idiot , a grotesque dude , a jerk , a joke ... "" Not right . " Harry suddenly said . 
The dining table was suddenly silent . 
Harry trembled . 
In his life , he has never been so angry . 
Uncle Vernon shouted , " ADD ME ! " Vernon's face was white now . 
He staggered Marge's unruly wine bottle , barking at Harry : " You , boy , go to bed , go away ... " But Marge hugged her with a raised hand . Marge's small red lips clung to Harry's eyes . " Go ahead , kid . 
Are you proud of your parents ? 
They found themselves in a car crash . 
I'm sure they were driving while drunk . " Harry suddenly found himself standing up : 
" My parents did not die in a car accident . " Marge shrieked , " you bastard ! 
They died in a car crash , and left you as a burden to your relentless , hardworking relatives . " Your anger makes the Miss Marge puffy . " You're an overly oily baby ... " Suddenly she stopped talking . 
For a moment the words seem to have vanished in Marge . 
She seemed to be swollen with an inexplicable anger . 
That bulge does not stop . 
Her reddened face began to swell , her swollen eyes bulged and her mouth so dilated that she could not open her mouth . 
Just in a moment , the buttons of the sweater she was wearing were ripped open and shot to the wall . 
Marge swallows like a bizarre bubble , her waist is not strained at her waistband , swollen in her state , each finger looks like an Italian sausage ... 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia screamed , " MARGE ! " Marge's entire body began to rise from the chair , flying slowly to the ceiling . 
At this point , Marge was filming , resembling a giant salvo with pig eyes . 
Her legs spread out in a strange way as her body flared up in the air , causing the sound to burst into chaos . 
The Ripper runs into the room , barking like crazy . 
Uncle Vernon took one of Marge's legs , trying to pull her down hard . 
He screamed : " NO ! " But Uncle Vernon was almost lifted off the floor . 
Ripper misunderstood the situation , leaping forward and pinching his sharp teeth into Uncle Vernon's legs . 
Harry jumped out of the dining room before being stopped by anyone . 
He went straight to the room at the foot of the stairs . 
As he reached the door , the door to the mansion burst open in a mysterious way . 
For a few seconds , it pulled the chest out to the front door . 
Then he jumped upstairs , slipped under the bed , picked up the loose floorboard , grabbed a pillowcase filled with books and homework and gave birthdays . 
Finishing it out , grab the empty cage of Hedwig , down the stairs , to the chest , just as Uncle Vernon rushed out of the dining room with his tattered trousers pouring blood . 
Uncussed : " BACK HERE ! BACK TO YOU AGAIN NOW ! " But the desperate rage made Harry no longer aware . 
He kicked the chest open and pulled out a wand and pointed it at Vernon . " It's worth it ! " Said Harry , his breath panting . 
Keep away ! " He fumbled behind his back to take the fist of the door . 
He said , " I'm going . 
I can not stand it . " In the blink of an eye , Harry was out in the dark , pulling up a heavy chest behind his back , and Hedwig's cage was under his arm . 
CHAPTER 3 VEHICLE TRANSMISSION 
Harry trudged past several roads , eventually collapsing to the low wall of Magnolia Road , gasping for the pull of a giant chest . 
He sat still for a moment , listened to the mad beating of his heart , resentment rising in his body . 
But after 10 minutes of sitting alone on the dark night , a new feeling invaded Harry , that is : panic . 
He found himself never in a worse situation than this ever . 
It was stuck , alone , in the dark Muggle world , but there was no place to go . 
But the most tragic thing in Harry's case today is that it has done a great deal of magic , meaning it's almost certainly going to get kicked out of Hogwarts . 
He had violated the Juvenile Witch Protection Act , and is now surprised that the Ministry of Magic has not yet dug up to arrest him , right where he is sitting . 
Harry shivered and looked down at the Magnolia Crescent . 
What will happen to it ? 
Was it arrested ? 
Or is it simply outlawed in the Wizarding world ? 
Thinking of Ron and Hermione , his heart sank . 
Harry knew that even if it was a crime , Ron and Hermione would be willing to help it at this time . 
But now they are both overseas , and Hedwig is already sent , and Harry has no other means of contacting his friends . 
Harry does not have any Muggle coin money . 
In its pockets at the bottom of the chest , there is now only a small amount of witchcraft , but all of the property left by her cheeks is kept in the coffers of the Gringotts Witchcraft Bank in London . 
How can you drag this heavy chest all the way from here to London ? 
Unless ... 
Harry looked down at the wand , still clutched in his hand . 
If he is expelled ( his heart aches stiffly ) , doing a little more magic does no harm either . 
It has the Invisibility Cloak inherited from the three . 
What would happen if it allowed the light chest to be like a feather , to put on a broomstick , to cover the Invisibility Cloak over me , and fly to London ? 
At that time , he would take out all the gold he had in his coffers at the Gringotts Witchcraft Bank and ... began to live the life of an outcast . 
It was a horrible prospect , but it could not sit still here . 
Anyway , there will be a Muggle policeman coming and he will have to explain why in the middle of the night it was off the street with a chest full of spells with a broom . 
Harry opened the chest , pushing the contents inside to search for the Invisibility Cloak . 
But when he found it , he suddenly stood up and looked around again . 
There was a tingling sensation at the back of Harry's neck , making it feel like someone was watching . 
But the street was completely deserted , no light emitted from any large rectangular house around . 
Harry continued to bend down to the chest , but straightened immediately once more , clutching his wand . 
He did not hear it but felt it : someone , or something , was standing somewhere in the narrow space between the garage and the row of fences behind Harry . 
Harry stared at the dark alley . 
If only that move , then Harry can know that it is just a wildcat or just something else . 
Harry murmured : 
" Lumos " A spotlight appears at the tip of the wand , making Harry want to blind his eyes . 
He raised his wand over his head , and the stone walls of the Second House were suddenly flickering . 
The garage door gleamed and Harry saw , very clearly , in the middle of the wall and the garage was the lumpy shape of something great , with the eyes shining brightly . 
Harry backed away . 
The trunk stumbles over the trunk and falls . 
The wand splashed out as it raised its arm at the fall . 
It fell , hit the gutter pipe . 
A deafening voice broke out and Harry had to put his hands tightly shut his eyes to avoid a sudden blast of light . 
At the same time , Harry screamed , flipping the cat on the road . 
Just a second later , a headlight and a pair of wheeled wheels hovered over and squealed , right where it had just been . 
Harry raised his head and saw that the pair of wheels were of a three - tiered purple bus , apparently just in the air . 
On the windshield of the car there are some yellow words : Knight car . 
For a split second , Harry wondered if he was going to fall because of the pain ? 
At that time , a purple absentee leaped out of the car and began to proclaim loudly : " Welcome to the Knights of the Carriage , the urgent shipment of witches and wizards is out of the question . in the jam . 
Just pick up your wand handles and we can take you wherever you want . 
My name is Stan Shumpike , and I will be ignoring the carriage of the car tonight ... " He ignored the car as he saw Harry - he was still sitting on the sidewalk . 
Harry picked up his wand , trying to stand up . 
Looking closer , Harry noticed that Stan Shumpike was only a few years older than him , eighteen or nineteen , with two big ears and a dull face . 
Stan said , " What are you doing here ? " Harry said , " Yeah . " Stan chuckled . " What are you doing ? " Harry was annoyed . " I did not intentionally fall . " One of Harry's jeans was torn at his knees , and the hand that he had crushed to support him when he fell . 
He suddenly remembered why it fell . 
He immediately turned to look at the alley between the garage and the fence . The headlights of the Knight's car illuminated the area , but the place was completely empty . 
Stan asked , " What are you looking at ? " Harry pointed at the empty space : " There was something very black , like a dog ... but it was horrible . " Harry turned to Stan . 
Stan's mouth opened slightly . 
Stan's eyes scanned Harry's forehead , making it uncomfortable . 
Stan suddenly asked : " What's on your forehead ? " Harry stroked his hair , covering his scar , trying to say , " Nothing . " 
He thinks if this is indeed the Ministry of Magic is searching for it , it should not give them the conditions to find it too easily . 
Stan kept asking , " What's your name ? " " Neville Longbottom . " Harry blurted out the first name in his mind . 
Then he continued to speak quickly , hoping to beat Stan : " So this car ... 
You say it can run anywhere ? " " right ! " Stan said proudly , " wherever you want it , as long as it's on the ground . 
The car can not dive . " But Stan was curious : " Hey , did you turn the car down , did not you ? 
Did you raise your wand on the car ? " Said Harry . 
He asked , how much does it cost to go to London ? Stan replied , " Eleven Sickles . 
But if thirteen are served chocolate , and fifteen Sickles have hot water bottles and toothbrushes of optional color . " Harry fumbled in his chest and dug out his purse , pouring out some silver coins for Stan . 
Then Stan and Harry carried their large cage to the third level of the car . 
Hedwig's cage was also neatly placed on the chest . 
There are no seats in the car . 
Instead , half a dozen brass bed frames lay close to the windows . 
On the shelf placed on each bed are lit candles light shining wood paneling . 
A little witch is busy sleeping , wearing a conical hat , lying at the end of the car mumbling : " Thank you , not this time . 
I'm picking up the snails . " Then he curled up in deep sleep . 
Stan whispered , " This bed of yours . " He pushed Harry's chest down under the bed in the driver's seat . 
The driver sitting on the chair behind the steering wheel introduced by Stan : " Ernie Prang , our driver . 
Ernie , this is Neville Longbottom . " Ernie Prang is an older witch with thick eyeglasses . 
Harry nodded anxiously , stroking the black hair on his forehead , and sat down on the bed . 
Stan sat down on the couch next to the driver and said , " Let the car run , Mr. Ernie . " A huge " explosion " resounded , Harry felt himself being rushed too fast by the coach . to fall to bed falling flat . 
Giving up , Harry peered out the dark window and saw the car running along a completely different path . 
Watching Harry's face in a dreamy way . 
He said , " This is the road we were running when you were bowed down . 
Ernie , where are we , somewhere in Wales ? " Ernie said , " Yeah . " 
Harry wondered , " How can Muggles do not hear anything about this bus ? " Stan replied with a scornful voice . " They ? 
They do not know how to listen properly , right ? 
They do not know how to look right . 
They do not care what the soul . " Stan , " Stan said , " it would be best to wake Marsh . 
In a minute we arrive in Abergavenny . Stan crossed Harry's bed and climbed up a narrow wooden staircase . 
Harry still looked out the window , feeling increasingly anxious . 
Ernie does not seem to be fully understanding how to operate a steering wheel . 
The Knight's car ran up the roadside forever , but fortunately it did not hit anything . 
Street lights , mail boxes , railings , trash ... just jump out of the way to avoid the road when the car came . 
Then , as the car passed , they jumped back to their original positions . 
Stan climbs down the stairs , following him as a green witch , wrapped in a traveling coat . 
As Ernie busted and the beds bent to three or four inches , Stan said cheerfully , " Come here , Mrs. Marsh . " Mrs. Marsh tucked her handkerchief into her mouth , squeezed it tightly , limped up to her feet . boat . 
Grab her bags down , then close the door . 
And another " earthquake " struck out , and the coach of the Knights darted down the narrow country road , causing the trees on both sides to jump out of the road . 
Harry could not sleep . 
Not because it's traveling in a car that's going crazy and throwing a jumper a hundred miles each time . 
And here , his stomach cramps whenever he thinks about what's going to happen , and whether at the Dursleys , his aunts managed to get Marge on the ground . 
Stan was opening the Daily Prophet and reading attentively with his tongue out between his teeth . 
A large photo on the front page of a haggard man with long , fluffy hair blinked at Harry . 
This man Harry was very familiar with . 
Harry forgot about it for a moment , exclaimed : " That man ! 
The Muggle Times also has a talk about him . " Stan flipped through the page and looked at the pleasure : " This is Sirius Black . 
Of course he must have appeared in the Muggle News , Neville . 
Are you new to the moon ? " Stan showed a superior delight in front of Harry's disgusted expression . 
He withdrew the cover of the newspaper to Harry . " You have to read more newspapers , Neville . " Harry put the newspaper out in the light of the candle that read : THE BROTHERS ARE BROKEN Sirius Black , perhaps the most infamous prisoner ever detained Taken in the Azkaban Prison , still evading arrest , the Ministry of Magic has confirmed that today . " We are doing everything we can to get Black back , " said Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge this morning . " And we ask the magic community to keep calm . " Mr Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Criminal Division for informing the Muggle prime minister of the crisis . 
Mr. Fudge said resentfully : " Yes , I must do so , do you understand ? 
Black is crazy . 
He is dangerous to anyone who is unlucky to meet him , whether he is a witch or a Muggle . 
I have been assured by Mr. Muggle that he will not reveal a word to anyone about Black's true identity . 
And now let's face it - if he's revealed , who else believes him ? " While the Muggles were warned that Black had a gun ( a kind of metal wand used by Muggles to kill each other ) , the wizarding community lived in fear of a massacre . The massacre happened twelve years ago . 
At that time , Black had killed thirteen at once , with only one curse . " Harry looked at Sirius Black's dim eyes , which was the only part of the haggard face that seemed lively . 
Harry had never met a vampire , but he had seen their image in the Dark Arts Prevention class . 
The Black , with its waxy white skin , looks like a vampire . 
Watching Harry read the paper , he now asked , " He looks so ugly ? " Harry returned the paper to Stan . " Did you kill thirteen with a curse ? " Stan said , " Oh . 
In the eyes of witnesses and in front of everyone . 
In the middle of the day the face . 
A shock , Mr. Ernie cup ? " Ờ . " Ernie answered . 
With his hands crossed behind his back , Stan twisted himself in a chair to look better at Harry . 
He said , " Black is a close - knuckle of the One that everyone knows . " Harry exclaimed without a thought . " What ? 
Voldemort ? " White roses are white with white roses . 
Ernie suddenly jerked the steering wheel so that a farmhouse had to jumped aside to dodge the car . 
Stan exclaimed , " Are you crazy ? 
What is his name ? " Harry said awkwardly , " I'm sorry . 
Sorry , I ... I forgot . " Forgot ! " Stan said weakly , " My dear , my heart wants to jump out of my chest ... " Harry said with apologetic expression : " So ... so .... 
Black is the hand of the One that everyone knows who it is ? Stan rubbed his chest and said , " That's right . 
Yeah , that's right . 
The legs are very close to the One who everyone knows is someone . 
People say ... 
Anyhow , when he was little Harry Potter pays grace to the One that everyone knows is someone ... " Harry confused clawed black hair covering the scar on his forehead . 
" ... all his limbs were spotted , did not he Ernie ? most of them know this is done , everyone knows that they are dead , they are dead . quietly 
But Sirius Black did not . 
I heard he thought he would be the deputy head once the One knew who he was . 
" Then , they were black in the middle of the road full of Muggle people . 
He pulled out the wand and blasted half the way , causing a witch to be killed , and twelve Muggles unluckily plagued . 
Easy to be afraid ? 
And do you know what Black was doing at that time ? " Stan whispered to Harry in a dramatic voice . 
Harry asked , " What ? " " Laugh ! " Stan replied . " He just stood there and laughed . 
And when the Ministry of Magic's officers arrived at the scene , he just quietly followed them like an idiot , laughing like crazy . 
Is he crazy , are not you Ernie ? 
He's crazy , is not he ? " Ernie slowly said , " If he's not in hell at Azkaban and he's not crazy yet , he's going crazy now . 
I would rather burst myself than have to step into that dungeon . 
He's worth it , too , for what he's done . " Stan went on : " You have to put up with that , Ernie ? 
A road explodes with a bunch of dead Muggles . 
Then they talked about what happened , Mr. Ernie ? " Ernie grunted . " Say the gas pipe . Stan stood up and hugged the haggard portrait of Black in the newspaper : " And now he is rampaging outside . 
There has never been a cybercrime in Azkaban , is it Ernie ? 
To die , do not understand how he can do that . 
Easy to be afraid of . 
Really , I can not imagine how he could have surpassed the Azkaban guards ! " Ernie shuddered . " Talk to Stan , the car has a good boy . 
The guards of Azkaban made me gai with me here . Stan put the newspaper down and Harry leaned against the window of the Knights train , feeling miserable than ever . 
It would be impossible to imagine what Stan would tell other passengers later : " Have you heard of Harry Potter ? 
It blows her aunt ! 
We carried him on the bus , knight , Mr. Ernie ? 
At that time it was trying to find a way out ... " It , Harry , broke the witch law , is not there anything else Sirius Black do not know to detonate her Marge is a felony enough to send it to hell Azkaban Harry did not know anything about the witch's prison , though all the people he had heard referred to the prison with a deadly scream . 
Hagrid , who holds the Hogwarts School Lock , had been there for two months , last year . 
Harry could not forget the horror of Hagrid's face as he was told he would be taken away . 
It was Hagrid who was one of the bravest men Harry knew ! 
The coach of the Knight went through the darkness , spreading out its paths of bushes , molds , mail boxes , trees ... 
And Harry , in a nervous and anxious state of anxiety , was lying awake on the feather bed . 
A moment later , Stan remembers that Harry had paid for a hot chocolate . 
But when he poured chocolate for Harry , the chocolate poured out of Harry's pillow , for at that moment , the car launched a " cold " from Angelsea to Aberdeen . 
One by one . 
You ride witches and wizards in pajamas and slippers , climb down to the lower deck of the coach to the side of the road . 
They were very pleased to get out of the car . 
In the end , Harry was the only passenger on the bus . 
Stan clapped his hands and said , " Now , Neville , where do you want to go to London ? " Harry said , " Alley . " Stan said , " Sit down . 
Go to the doctor ! " THANK YOU ! 
The car ran along Charing Cross Road . 
Harry sat up , looked at the buildings and the benches had to wiggle his way , resembling to dodge the car running regardless of heaven regardless of this land . 
This election has dawned . 
She will make her hiding place for a few hours , then go to the Gringotts witch bank as soon as the bank opens , then go out - where to go , it is unknown . 
Ernie bumped and the car slipped straight ahead of a tiny , smelly little pub - Cai Vac . 
Behind this shop there is a mysterious gate to enter the alley . 
Harry said to Ernie , " Thank you . " Harry jumped down the stairs at the car door , helping Stan lower his chest and Hedwig's cage down the road . 
" Okay , goodbye , " said Harry , but Stan did not pay attention to Harry's farewell . 
He stood on the steps of the car that rolled his eyes to the dim gate of Cai Vac . 
A voice said , " I'm here , Harry . " Before Harry turned around , he felt a hand on his shoulder . 
At the same time , Stan shouted , " Insert me ! 
Mr. Ernie is here ! 
Come on , Mr. Ernie ! " Harry looked up at the owner of the hand that was on his shoulders . 
It suddenly felt like a bucket of ice sprinkled on the intestinal lining : it bumped into the Minister of Magic himself - Cornellius Fudge . 
Stan jumped to the side of the road , standing next to them . 
He exclaimed , " Minister , what did you just call Neville ? " Mr. Cornelius Fudge was a small but fat man with a long striped jacket . 
He looked cold and exhausted . 
" Seriously , " he said , " Neville , this is Harry Potter . " Ernie ! 
Ernie ! Who do you think Neville is ? 
It's Harry Potter ! 
I see the scars ! Mr. Cornelius Fudge was a little annoyed : " Hmm . 
Well , I'm glad the Knight Bus has picked Harry up here , but now he and I need to get into the Barnacle Factory ... " Cornelius Fudge's hand gripped Harry's shoulders . , and Harry finds himself pushed into the Pub . 
A bunch of coyotes holding a lantern through the door behind the bar . It's Mr. Tom , the boss's dry and tucked teeth . 
Mr. Tom said : 
" Minister , you found the boy ! 
Do you want to spend ? 
Wine or beer ? " Cornelius Fudge said , " Maybe a teacup is enough . " The Minister of Magic still did not let go of Harry's shoulder . 
Stan and Ernie appear . 
Both carrying Hedwig's chest and cage in the bar , looked around with excitement : " Why do not you tell us who you are , Neville ? " Stan asked Harry , his face radiant , While Ernie's dicked face stuck out Stan's shoulders , Harry looked at him with delight . 
Cornelius Fudge added to the innkeeper , " And please give me a private room to talk to , Tom . " Harry miserably told Stan and Ernie , " Goodbye you two . " Cornelius Fudge follows Tom's directions through the driveway from the bar . 
Stan called out , " Goodbye , Neville ! " Cornelius Fudge accompanied Harry with the lantern in Tom's hand through a narrow hallway to a small dining room . 
Tom flicked his hand , a flame in the fireplace . 
He bowed and walked out of the room . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge pointed to a chair by the fireplace , telling Harry , " Sit down , Harry . " Harry sat down , feeling a goose bumps rising up his arms , despite the flickering flicker . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge took off his striped jacket and squeezed it aside . 
He straightened the two bottlenecks of the blue suit he was wearing , and sat down opposite Harry . " Harry , I'm Cornelius Fudge , Minister of Magic . " Of course Harry knew this . 
He had seen Cornelius Fudge once before , but at that time he was wearing a Cloak so Cornelius Fudge could not see it , and so he did not know it knew him . 
Mr. Tom , the restaurant owner , reappeared , wearing an apron outside his nightgown , holding a tray of tea and sponge cake . 
He placed the tray on the table , between Harry and Cornelius Fudge , and he walked out of the room , closing the door . 
Cornelius Fudge poured tea and said , " That's it , Harry . 
You made us all upset ; I'm not afraid to tell you this . 
You ran away from your aunt's house like that ! 
I started worrying ... but only , you are safe , that is important . " Cornelius Fudge put the butter on a piece of sponge , and pushed the fork over to Harry : " Eat , Harry . 
He looked dumbfounded . 
Now this ... 
You will be glad to hear this : We have resolved the accident unfortunately caused Marge Dursley . 
Two specialists from the Accident Recovery Department were rushed to Privet Drive a few hours ago . 
Miss Marge was fuming and adjusting her memory . 
She will not remember anything about the accident . 
That's it , and there's no harm . " Mr. Cornelius Fudge smiled at Harry , his mouth close to the cup of tea . 
He looks like an uncle searching his favorite nephew . 
Harry could not believe his ears . 
He opened his mouth to say , but did not think of anything to say , so shut up . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge said , " Well , I'm sure you're worried about your aunt and uncle's reaction ? 
Well , I do not deny that they are extremely angry , Harry , but they are prepared to receive me back next summer , as long as I stay at Hogwarts on Christmas and Easter . . " Harry cleared his throat . " I always stay at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter . 
And I never want to go back to Privet Drive . " Mr. Cornelius Fudge said in a worried voice , " Well , I guarantee you will feel different , once you have calmed down . 
After all , it's my family , and I'm sure everyone in the family loves each other ... 
uh ... from the bottom of my heart " Harry was not bothered by the thought of Cornelius Fudge , who was anxiously awaiting what was going to happen to him . 
Cornelius Fudge put the butter on the second sponge cake : " So all the rest is to decide where I will be for the next two weeks of summer . 
I suggest you stay here , rent a motel room in this Cauldron , and ... " Harry blurted out : " Wait , what about my punishment ? " Mr. Cornelius Fudge blinked : " What punishment ? " Harry miserably said , " You broke the law - the Juvenile Minor Limitations Act ! "" Oh , my son , we do not punish you for such a thing . " Mr. Cornelius Fudge exclaimed , waving his spit out impatiently . " It's just an accident . 
We do not imprison people in Azkaban for blaming an aunt . " But this does not relieve Harry's obsession with his Department - of - Magic history . 
He frowned and said , " Last year , I received an official warning just because an elf broke a cake in my aunt's house ! 
The Magician says he will be kicked out of Hogwarts School if there is any magic in the house . " Harry's eyes tricked him , but it was obvious that the Minister of Magic suddenly felt so embarrassed : " The situation has changed , Harry ... 
We should keep in mind ... in the air today ... that you definitely do not want to be fired ? " Of course not . " Said Harry promptly . 
And Cornelius Fudge laughed happily , " So , what the fuss ? 
Well , eat a sponge cake for Harry , while I arranged a room with Tom for him . " Mr. Cornelius Fudge strode out of the small living room , where Harry sat at the sight of him . 
There is something very weird going on . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge waited for it in front of Cai Vac's shop to do something other than to punish it for what it did ? 
And now that Harry started thinking of himself when the Minister 
Magic must deal with juvenile magic problems , it is not normal . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge is back with Mr. Tom . 
Mr. Fudge said , " Room eleven is empty , Harry . 
I think you will be comfortable here . 
There is only one thing I'm sure you understand : I do not want to go wandering in the Muggle city of London , okay ? Travel within the alley only . 
And I have to come back here before nightfall every night . 
Sure you understand , right ? 
Tom will look after you for me . " Harry said slowly , " but why ? " Cornelius Fudge said in intimate laughter , " We do not want to miss you again . 
No no ... 
It is best to know where you are ... 
That means ... " Mr. Cornelius Fudge cleared his throat loudly , then picked up his striped jacket : " Well , I have to go , you know , there's a lot to do . " Asked Harry . " Did Black find out ? " Cornelius Fudge's finger slipped off the silver button on the jacket he was wearing . 
" What ? 
Turns out , you know . 
Well , no , no , but it's just a matter of time . 
The Azkaban guards never failed to pursue the defectors ... 
And they are mad at this , I have never seen them so angry . " He shrugged his shoulders . " Well , goodbye . " He reached out and Harry shook his hand , and it came up with a great idea : " Err ... Minister , can I ask you a favor ? " Mr. Cornelius Fudge smiled : " Yes . "" Third year Hogwarts students are allowed to visit Hogwarts , but their grandmother refuses to sign the application form . 
Can not you sign me ? " Mr. Cornelius Fudge is not very comfortable : " Well , no . 
Where not . 
I'm sorry , Harry , but I'm not your parent or guardian . " Harry pleaded , " But you are the Minister of Magic . 
If you allow ... " Mr. Cornelius coldly cut Harry's words : " No , I'm sorry , Harry , but the rule is the law . 
You can visit Hogsmeade village next school year too . 
Actually , I think it's best not to ... 
Yes , I have to go . Stay here happily , Harry . " Give Harry the last smile and shake his last hand , Cornelius Fudge , out of the room . 
Now the owner of the new Tom shop laughed close to Harry : " Come and follow me , Potter . 
I brought all your belongings to the room . " Harry followed Tom on a beautiful wooden staircase to the eleventh bronze room on the door . 
Tom opened the door and pushed Harry out . 
Inside the room there was a soft bed , some polished oak tables and chairs , and a flaming fire in the fireplace . 
And on top of the closet was : " Hedwig ! " Harry gasped . 
The white feathered snowflakes and the flapping wings fluttered into Harry's arms . 
Mr. Tom laughs : " You have a very intelligent owl . 
You've just arrived in five minutes and it's flying . 
Do not hesitate to call me , Potter , if you need anything . " He bowed again and walked out . 
Harry sat on the bed for a long time , stroking Hedwig absently . 
The sky outside the window is rapidly changing from deep blue velvet to cold gray steel , and then in a modest way , the pinkish rays turn yellowish . 
Harry hardly believed it had just left his house on Privet Drive a couple of hours ago . 
And it is not expelled . 
And from today it will enjoy two full weeks without being tortured by the Dursleys . 
He yawned , telling Hedwig , " I've been through an uneventful night , Hedwig . " He lay down on his pillow , not bothering to take his eyes off , closing his eyes to sleep . 
CHAPTER 4 
It took Harry many days to get used to the new freedom he had . 
In the past , he could never wake up whenever he wanted , or eat anything he liked . 
Now , it can go wherever it likes , as long as it's in the alley . 
And because this long , winding brick road was full of the most interesting cafes in the world , Harry was not too keen on arguing with Cornelius Fudge to get into the Muggle world . . 
Every morning , Harry had breakfast at Cai Vac . 
There it is a pleasure to see the other guests : small funny mermaid in the countryside to the shopping market of the day , the gurus look so respectable controversy rumors about the new article most in the magazine of modern day ; The Warriors of the Warriors , the Dwarfs talk , and once , a very suspicious man who looks like an extremely ugly witch , hooded with a wool scarf , arrives . cry a fresh liver . 
After breakfast , Harry went to the backyard of the bar , took out his wand , knocked on the third brick from the left above the trash , and stood back as the canopies of the open alley opened . out from the wall . 
Harry spent days in the sunshine wandering the stores , then dined at the bar stalls , under colorful umbrellas . 
There it happily spread the joy of the other guests showing off what they had bought after a day of buying and selling . 
( " This is the moon , my dear old man , do not crash into the moon chart anymore , do you know ? " ) Or listen to the comments on the Sirius Black case . ( " Personally , I would not let young children go out alone if Sirius 
Black has not been sent back to Azkaban ! " ) Now Harry did not need to do the homework in the flashlight hiding under the blanket over his head . 
Now it can sit in the bright sunshine of the Florentine Fortescue's ice cream parlor , which makes all of its essays , and is sometimes tipped out by Florean Fortescue . 
In addition to knowing much about the cremation of the medieval witches , Florean Fortescue gallantly , every half hour give Harry a glass of fruit cream . 
Once he had packed his wallet with gold , silver , and silver knickers from his father's treasury to leave it in the Gringotts bank , Harry needed to practice a lot of self - control over his lack of money . take all the money for a while . 
Harry had to remind himself that he had five more years at Hogwarts , and thought about what if he had to ask Dursleys aunt to buy a textbook and how it would feel . 
As a result , Harry prevented himself from buying the beautiful Gobstones ( a slightly - ball - like game in which the invisible players in the game lost points on a scentless liquid ) . ) . 
It is also lacerated in the presence of a model of galaxy that moves perfectly in a giant glass globe . 
With that ball , it would not need to study any more astronomy . 
But its most self - restrained qualities are the ones displayed in the shop Harry likes : " High Quality Quidditch Equipment . " 
It appeared after Harry had been staying at Cai Vac for a week . 
At that time , Harry was curious about the crowd crowding around a shop to see what the world was watching . 
She squeezed in , wrapped up among the sorcerers and scribes screaming , and then saw a new platform set up in the middle of the shop , displaying the most splendid broom seen in life . 
A jawed witch said to his companion , " Come on in here ... sample ... " A little boy , Harry , wriggled his arm , " It's a modern broom . " The Irish international has just ordered seven beautiful brooms ! " The shop owner told the crowd . 
And that is the World Cup's favorite team . " The huge sorceress stood in front of Harry leaving , so that she could move closer to read the sign next to the broom : Tia Blossom This bold , The wood is polished ash , polished with polished diamonds and handmade by hand . 
Each broom is individually selected from birch branches for broomsticks and polished to achieve aerodynamic perfection , making the lightning bolt unmatched , and precision the most accurate . 
Lightning can accelerate from 0 - 150 mph in ten seconds and install an unscathed spell . 
Price negotiable when ordering . 
Price negotiable when ordering ... 
Harry did not want to think of how many gold coins the lightning broom was worth . 
In life he has never wanted anything so earnest . 
But he also remembered that he had never lost a Quidditch match while playing on his Nimbus 2000 broomstick . 
So what must be all the gold in his coffers to buy Lightning , while it has a great Nimbus 2000 trees ? 
Harry did not ask for the price , but almost returned to the store every day , only to stand at the lightning bolt . 
But there are also many things that Harry needs to buy . 
He went to the drug store to add materials to the toxicology course . 
And because her witch's school uniform is now on her ankle , it has to go to Mrs. Malkin's Every Occasion Dress shop to buy some new sets . 
Most importantly , the purchase of school books , including the textbooks of the next two subjects of the next school year , Care of the Living Creatures and the Prophets . 
When looking at the bookshop window , Harry was surprised . 
Instead of displaying gold - plated spellbinding books as usual , a large iron cage was placed behind the glass door , containing hundreds of " Monsters of Monsters " . 
Locked in the cage , the books that bizarre monstrous aggressive bite to tear each other in the constant struggle irresistible , making the pages ragged tattered everywhere . 
Harry pulled out his list of textbooks . 
The Monster Book of Monsters is listed as a textbook for the mysterious Creature Care . 
What little Hagrid said that the book would be useful for him later ; Now it's understandable . 
He felt relieved : he thought Hagrid wanted him to help some more horrible animals . 
As Harry walked into the bookstore and the bookstore , the bookstore manager walked over to Harry . 
He immediately asked , " Hogwarts ? 
to buy new books huh ? " Harry , " he said , " I need you ... " But he managed to say , " Get out . " He pushed Harry aside , pulled a pair of thick gloves into his hands , and picked up a fierce rod , reaching for the door of the iron cage that contained the books " The Monsters of Monsters " . 
Harry hurriedly said , " Wait a minute , I've got that book . " An expression of relief spread across his manager's face . 
" Really ? 
Thank heaven and earth ! 
In the morning I had been bitten by the monsters for five times . " A tear sounded in the air , two books " Monster Beast " just grabbed a third book and tried to tear it up . 
The bookstore manager screamed , " Stop ! 
Stop ! " He poked the iron bar and knocked out the two books . 
He swore : " I never store this book again ! 
They turn the bookstore into a madhouse ! 
I thought when I bought two hundred Haunted Invisibility Films was the worst thing ever ! 
Those two hundred books are worth a fortune , there are few , so they are stealth lost , find out ! ... 
Well , what else do you buy ? " Harry looked down at his book list , saying , " Yes , I need Cassandra Vablatsky's book " Look Inside the Future . " " Well , you started studying Prophecy ? " The manager took off his gloves and led Harry to the back of the bookstore , where there was a corner dedicated to divination . 
A small table filled with books like " Predictions for the Uncertainty of Prophecy : Self Defense Against Resolutions " and " The Ballroom : When Turning to the Disposable Turbulence . " 
The manager said , " Here , the ' Bright Future ' . " He climbed up the steps to get down a thick , black book . " This book is a great guide to all the basic divination methods - from hand pointing to glass frogs , bird watching ... 
" But Harry did not listen to the manager anymore . 
His eyes met another book , which was displayed in the books on the small table : " Death Signs : What to Do When the Worst of Things Happens " . 
The manager realized what Harry was staring at . 
He said softly , " If I were you , I would never read that book . 
Reading it , people found dead spots everywhere , only that enough to make people scared to death always . " But Harry continued to look at the cover of the book , a large black dog like a bear , with bright eyes . 
Harry looked very familiar ... 
The salesman presses on the book , " Do you want anything else ? " Harry finished his eyes from the shining eyes of the dog and asked his book list . 
" Yes ... I need the book " Instantaneous Transformation " and " Book of Basic Quotes , Grade Three . " Ten minutes later , Harry came out of the bookstore with a pile of new books in his hands , making his way to the Cauldron . 
He ignored it , and touched many people without notice . 
Climb up the stairs to your room , Harry in the room , put the books on the bed . 
The bed was folded neatly , the window was opened and the sun filled the room . 
Harry could hear the bus running down the Muggle Street behind Cai Dien , but he could not see . 
And it could not see the noisy crowd in the Alley . 
Sitting here , it just heard the sound of the only . 
At the shower , Harry saw himself in the mirror . 
He hinted at his reflection : " That one can not be a mortal . 
When I saw " that " on Magnolia Crescent , I was in a state of panic . 
Maybe it's just a wandering dog ... " He automatically raised his hand to try to smooth the hairs down . 
In a whisper , the mirror said , " You're going through a losing battle to see ... " oOo The last few days of summer , Harry started looking for Ron and Hermione all over . 
Now many Hogwarts students go to Alley to prepare for the new school year that will soon begin . 
Harry also met some of Gryffindor's co - founders , including Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas , in the high - quality Quidditch Store . 
They also go to this shop to look at the lightning bolt lightning . 
Harry also accidentally knocked Neville Longbottom " the damage " outside the shop Phu Qui and Co Han ; He has a round face and his forgetfulness seems to be missing out on the list of required textbooks for the next school year . 
Harry did not dare to stop talking to Neville because Neville was being scolded by his grandmother - a frightened sorceress - scolded so badly that even the passerby was blind . 
Harry could only wish she had never known what it was like pretending to be Neville on the coach of the Knights when he tried to flee the Ministry of Magic . 
On the last day of the holiday , Harry wakes up , thinking that if he did not meet Ron and Hermione's close friends in the Alley , he would meet again on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow . 
Thought so that Harry peace of mind to sit up , change clothes , go to Alley Cross to see the last time the lightning bolt . 
And while he was wondering where to eat lunch , Harry heard his name being screamed at him , echoing through the streets : " HARRY ! 
HARRY ! " Harry turned around and saw the two of them sitting outside the Fortescue ice cream parlor . 
Ron was so incredibly freckled , and Hermione's skin was tanned to tan . 
Both of them were crying at Harry . 
Harry sat down next to the two of them , and Ron grinned . " It's finally up to you ! 
This is an insect to find you , but they said you just left . 
So we went to Phu Qui and Co Han bookstores , then Mrs. Malkin's shop , and then ... " Harry explained to the two of them : " I have prepared all my supplies for the new school year from the previous week . . 
How do you know that you live in Cai Vac ? " He said ! " Ron answered simply . 
Mr. Weasley is an officer working in the Ministry of Magic , of course he must have heard the whole story of what happened to Miss Marge . 
Hermione asked Harry in a serious tone : " Did you really blow up your aunt , Harry ? " Harry tried to say , " I did not mean to do that . 
I just ... losing control . " Ron burst out laughing , but Hermione grunted , " There's nothing funny , Ron . 
Strangely enough , I was surprised that Harry was not expelled . " Harry saw that . " I see that too . 
Do not talk about expulsion , I even thought I was going to be arrested again ! " Looking at Ron probe , Harry asked , " Does your father know why Mr. Fudge is still free ? " Ron giggled , shrugging his shoulders . " Maybe it's your famous Harry Potter , sort of . 
If you blow up your aunt's aunt up then it is not dare to imagine what the Ministry of Magic will do yourself . 
But , to tell you , before they were going to do something , they had to dig it up , because it was sure that their nose was already dead . 
Anyway , tonight you ask my dad . 
Tonight our family also stays at Cai Vac , so tomorrow morning you can go with your family to Nga King Cross Station , to catch the Hogwarts ! 
Hermione stayed there too . " Hermione nodded in confirmation , her face bright . " This morning my parents dropped me down here with all my belongings . " Harry was so happy : " Excellent cat ! 
So you have enough new books and other things ? " Look , Harry ! " Ron said as he pulled out a long box and opened it : 
" brand new wand , gin nhé ! 
Three inches long , made of shallow wood containing a caudal peduncle . 
And books are enough for us ... " He pointed at the bag full of children at his feet , continued , " Oh , do you know anything about the book Monster ? 
At this time we said that they need to buy these two books , he sold books almost crying always . " On the chair , next to Hermione was not just Ron's big bag , but three big bulging bags . 
Harry asked , " What are these piles , Hermione ? " The little girl replied , " Well , I'm enrolled in a lot of new subjects , are not you ? 
These are books of Arithmetic , Care of the Mysterious Creatures , Prophets , Mystic Signs , Muggles , Study ... Ron turned his eyes to Harry and asked Hermione , " What do you need to learn Muggle - study ? 
You know all about the Muggle . " Hermione said enthusiastically , " but studying them from the witch's point of view is very attractive ! " While Ron laughed , Harry asked , " Are not you going to eat or sleep all this year , Hermione ? " Hermione checked her purse , ignoring the sarcasm of the two friends . 
" I still have 10 Galleons , " she said , " and this is my mother's birthday to celebrate her birthday in September . 
The parents told me to give in advance to choose their own birthday gift satisfactory . " Said Ron , innocently : " So go buy a nice book ! " Hermione kept her cool : " No , I do not . 
I really want an owl . 
I mean , Harry has Hedwig , and Ron has Errol ... " Ron corrected : " But I do not have an owl , Errol is a family owl . 
I only have Scabbers . " He took the fat mouse out of his pocket , put the Scabbers on the table in front of them , added : " I have to check it again . 
Considering the Egyptian climate does not suit it very well . " The scabbir looked a bit sicker than usual , and his beard was clearly visible . 
Now Harry knew every detail of Crossroads as if it were a land of the land . 
He said , " There's a mystery shop over there . 
We went there to try to remodel the Scabbers again , and make an owl for Hermione . " So the three of us paid for ice cream and crossed the street to the Mystery Store . 
Inside the store is cramped . 
Every inch of the wall is filled with cages . 
The animals in the cage , any strong son screaming , moaning , growling , barking , singing how to make the shop noisy to speak , again smell ! 
The shopkeeper standing behind the counter was busy advising the old magician to take care of the two newts , so Harry , Ron and Hermione enlisted waiting while admiring the cages of all kinds . animals 
A pair of giant purple dogs are sipping and licking the dying blue flies . 
A turtle with a precious apricot shine glows by the window . 
The stingy orange snails slowly crawled on the wall of the glass pan . 
There is a fat white rabbit that mips itself into a silk hat , and when it explodes , it reappears in the shape of a rabbit . 
Cats are everywhere , all colors . 
Every time the colt is trapped in a cage of laughter . 
There was a basket of milk balls whistling loudly . 
And at the counter there was an immense cage of smooth black mice using their long tail to play the jump rope . 
The two - headed wizards had left the store , Ron approached the counter . 
She said to the witch , " This is my mouse . 
Since you brought it back to Egypt , its hair slightly flew a bit . " The witch said , " Put it on the counter ! " She pulled out a pair of heavy black glasses in her pocket . 
Ron picked up his mouse from his pocket and placed it next to the rat's cage , and the rats stopped playing the tail rope , rushed to the cage bars , pushing each other for a better view . 
Like all Ron's possessions , Scabbers mice are old things to be ceded to Ron , ( which is owned by Percy ) , so he looks like he has fiber . Placed next to the mouse e in the cage , Scabbers look really pathetic . 
The scabbers picked up the scabbers and said , " Hmm , how old is this rat ? " Ron said , " Who knows ! 
But it's a bit old , it's my old one . " The witch looks at the Scabbers more carefully : " What talent is it ? " Eh ... " Ron said . 
The fact is that the Scabbers have never had a job to call talent . 
The scabblers ' eyes were scorched from the scabbard's left ear and their forelegs were pinched with one finger , and then the tongue was sharpened : " Well , this animal has experienced hardship and hardship here . " Ron's defense : " Percey's brother told me it was so wild , " said the witch . " A normal , normal mouse , or a rat like this garden mouse . Do not expect to live for more than three years , or that size is the same . 
Now if you want to get a little more life , then you will have to enjoy these little ones ... " The witch was just black mice , and the floods immediately set up the tail rope game . 
Ron murmured , " You bastard ! " The witch reached out under the counter and took out a small red bottle , saying to Ron , " If you do not want to change the mouse , you can try this drug . " Ron said , " Yes . 
How much ? 
- - OUCH ! " Ron ducked down when something big came out from the top of the cage , landed on Ron's head , then lunged furiously , aiming at the Scabbers . 
The sorcerer shouted : " DO NOT ! 
CROOKSHANKS , DON ! " But the Scabbers flashed in time , just like a sack of soap from the witch's hand , dropped to the ground on its four limbs , and rushed out the door . 
" Scabbers ! " He ran out of the shop , chasing after the mouse . 
Harry also followed . 
They took ten minutes to find the Scabbers , who were refugees in the trash outside the high quality Quidditch Store . 
Ron shoved the shaggy animal back into his pocket . 
As Ron stood up straight , he asked Harry , " What was that kid ? " Harry said , " An extremely big cat , or a little tiger . " " Where's Hermione ? " I'm still buying the owl . " They walked back up the busy street , back to the Mystery Store . 
They arrived just as Hermione came out . 
But she did not carry the cage as Ron and Harry thought , holding a fawn orange cat in her arms . 
" Are you buying that monster ? " Hermione's brows brightened . " Did not you see it was beautiful ? " Harry thought it was a kind of conception . 
The feline's feathered hair is indeed thick and rugged , but its legs are slightly rounded , and its face is slightly grimy , strangely obliterated , as if the cat had just slammed into the face . brick wall . 
However , the face of the Scabbers , the cat was moaning ... contentedly in Hermione's arms . 
" Hermione , that animal almost crushed my scalp ! " Said Hermione . " It was not intentional . 
Right hip , open Crookshanks ? " Pointing at the cloak in his pocket , Ron asked , " What will the Scabbers do ? 
It needs rest and peace of mind . 
How can it rest when the monster is next to it ? " Oh , that reminds me of it . 
You forgot this bottle of mice . " Hermione fumbled into Ron a small red bottle . 
She added : " Do not worry anymore . 
Crookshanks will sleep in his bedroom , and Scabbers are in your bedroom , what's wrong ? 
Poor Crookshanks , the shopkeeper said it had been banished there for several generations without anyone buying it . " Ron scoffed , " Why is that ? " Then the three of them walked toward Cai Vac . 
Inside the bar , they met Mr. Weasley reading the Daily Prophet . 
He looked up at Harry , smiling : " Harry ! 
How are you ? " 
" Yes , I'm fine , thank you . " The three of them sat down next to Mr. Weasley , putting the things they bought next door . 
Mr. Weasley put the paper down , and Harry saw a face that had become quite familiar with it : Sirius Black . 
Black's image was glaring at Harry . 
Asked Harry . " They have not caught him yet ? " Mr. Weasley's face looked extremely serious . 
They dragged us out of every day work in the Ministry of Magic to focus on catching him , which until now is not yet . " Ron asked , " If we catch him , will we be rewarded ? 
It's good to have some more money ... " Mr. Weasley shook his head : " Do not talk funny , Ron . " Mr. Weasley's look was tense . 
He said : " Sirius Black will never again let a thirteen - year - old witch catch up . 
Remember your father , the new Azkaban guards are the ones who bring him back to that place . " Mrs. Weasley walked into the bar , her armpit was full of shopping . 
She was followed by Fred and George . 
These two guys are about to enter their second year at Hogwarts . 
Next is the new head of Nam Sinh Percy and the youngest sister and the only daughter of the Weasley family , Ginny . 
This girl always shy in front of Harry , now is even more embarrassing than ever to meet Harry in the shop . 
Probably because she felt sorry for Harry at the end of last school year at Hogwarts . 
She flushed her nose and whispered , " Hi , " without looking up at Harry . 
Percy , however , raised his hand and shook Harry's hand solemnly as if he had just known it for the first time . 
He said , " Good morning , Harry , " he said with a smile . " Hi Percy . " Percy shook Harry's hand as if shaking hands with the Mayor : " Hope you're fine ? " Very well , thank you . " Fred nudged Percy to brush him off , then lowered his bow and gesture : " It was great to meet you ... " It was not over yet . George pushed aside , George grabbed Harry shook hands to shake : " Wonderful ! 
Well , all the talking ! " Percy scowled at the two of them . 
Mrs Weasley said , " Okay , enough . " But Fred said , " Mom ! " As if she had just discovered Mrs Weasley , and she had taken her hand and shook her hand , " It was horrible to meet her . " Mrs. Weasley repeated in a steadier voice : " She said enough ! " She put the shopping items on an empty seat : 
" Harry , are you sure you know the good news of your family ? " She pointed to the shiny silver badge glittering on Percy's chest : " The second male leader in that family Grandma ! " She smiled brightly , covering her face with pride . 
" And lastly , " said Mrs. Weasley , frowning . " I have no doubt about that . 
I noticed that people do not let you two become leaders again , do not say anything ... " But George seems rebellious in the idea of ​​ becoming a leader : " What do you do ? 
Only the lost in the joy of life . " Ginny chuckled . 
Mrs. Weasley said , " Would you like to set a good example for that girl ? " Percy said with a sigh . " Ginny has other brothers to follow , too . 
I would like to go change for dinner ... " Percy just walked away as George exhaled one . 
He spoke privately to Harry : " We were trying to capture a picture of a needle . 
But the bad luck is that we were caught by the cheeks . " That evening was a good time . 
Owner Tom had three tables in the dining room to accommodate the seven of the Weasley family , adding Harry and Hermione to a five - party dinner . 
When the cup came out , Fred asked , " Tomorrow I go out to the King's Cross Station . " He said , " The Ministry gives us two carriages . " Everyone looked up at him . 
Percy curiously asked , " Why are you granted that ? " George performed a grave face : " That's for you , Percy . 
And there will be small flags on the ribs , along with the TLNS badge ... " Fred continued , " ... for the Master , Lieutenant . " Everyone , except Percy and Mrs. Weasley , choked on a chocolate cake . 
" Why , " said Mr. Weasley , " because I do not have any cars to go to ... and because Because Dad worked there , they helped ... " Mr. Weasley's voice was natural , but Harry could not help but notice that his ears were flushed , just like Ron's when Ron was under pressure . somehow 
Mrs Weasley said quickly : " It is also a good thing . 
Do you know how many luggage we have ? 
Imagine the scene carrying the luggage carrying the luggage subway station of the Muggle people ... that bored . 
Do you arrange packing ? " Percy said in a low voice for a long moment : " Ron has not given up on his new shopping list . 
It even left a lot of space in my bed . " 
Mrs. Weasley immediately said to the bottom of the table : " Ron , I should go and sort your luggage soon , because tomorrow morning we will not have much time . " Ron scowled at Percy scowling . . 
After dinner everyone was full and sleepy . 
One by one go up the stairs to their room to check the furniture for the next day . 
Ron and Percy's room were next to Harry's room . 
Harry had just closed the lid and closed the lock and suddenly heard the angry voice echoing through the partition walls of the two rooms . 
He ran through the next room to see what was going on . 
The door to the number 12 opened and Percy's voice came out : " He was here earlier , on the bedside table . 
You took it off to polish ... Ron's voice screamed : " I did not touch it , did you hear ? " Harry asked , " What's wrong ? " Percy turned to Harry and said : " Your male student leader badge has disappeared . " Ron threw the contents out of his chest , complaining : " The Scabbard medicine bottle has also disappeared ! 
I think I must have forgotten it under the bar ... " Percy shrieked . " I have to find your badge before you go somewhere . " Harry said to Ron , " I've got my luggage ready , let me go and get a bottle of herbal remedies . " Harry went down the stairs . 
It was so dark , just halfway through the corridor leading to the bar , he heard two other angry voices coming out of the dining room . 
Just a second or two later , Harry realized that it was Mrs. Weasley's voice . 
He hesitated , not wanting them to know that he had heard them arguing . 
But then his name was mentioned by the two of them , which made him go closer to the dining - room door : " ... not telling him is not wise at all , " said Mr. Weasley . " Harry has a right to know . 
He tried to convince Mr. Fudge , but he insisted on treating Harry as a child . 
He's thirteen now and ... "" Brother Arthur , the truth will make the boy scared to death ! " - Mrs. Weasley's shrill voice , " Do you really want Harry to go to school with the fear of danger hovering over his head ? 
Please do good , it does not know that it was fun . Mr. Weasley argued , " I do not want to make a miserable boy , I just want him to have good vigilance ! 
You know what kind of kid Harry and Ron are : wandering alone in the night - They've been in the Forbidden Forest twice already ! 
This year , Harry absolutely did not do that anymore ! 
He thought about what could happen to him the night he left home and shivered . 
If the coach could not pick him up here , he'd bet it was dead before the Minister of Magic found it . " But it does not die ! 
He's fine , so what do you mean ? " Molly , I told you , Sirius Black is crazy . 
And though he was insane , he was wise enough to escape from the Azkaban jail - a seemingly impossible affair . 
what happens 
Three weeks have passed since no one saw his hair . 
He did not listen to what Mr. Fudge was complaining to the Prophet . 
The story of Sirius Black is far more distant than the invention of the wand itself . 
The only thing we know for sure is that Sirius Black is pursuing ... "" But Harry at Hogwarts is absolutely safe . "" We have envisioned Azkaban as absolute safety . 
But if Sirius Black can break the Azkaban , he can also infiltrate Hogwarts . "" But no one really knows that Sirius Black is pursuing Harry ... " At that moment a jarring sound of something hit the wood , and Harry was convinced that Mr. Weasley was punching a fist . " Molly , how many times do you have to tell me ? 
People did not report it in the newspaper because Mr. Fudge wanted it kept secret . 
But the night Black escaped , Fudge arrived at Azkaban Prison . 
Prisoner had reported to Fudge that Black had often said babble during sleep . 
Always the same words : " It's at Hogwarts ... 
It's at Hogwarts ! " Molly , I remember , Black was mad , he just wanted Harry dead . 
If you ask him , he tells you , he believes that killing Harry will help the One who knows that someone is back to power . 
Sirius Black has lost everything on the night that Harry dissipated the power of the One that everyone knows someone . 
It has sucked on that cuckold in the iron cage of the Azkaban jail for twelve years ... " Harry kept his ear close to the door , eager to hear more . 
But it just heard the silence ... " Well , Arthur , you see what is right you do . 
But did you forget Professor Dumbledore ? 
I do not believe that there is anything that could hurt Harry at Hogwarts once Dumbledore was the Rector of the school . 
I'm sure Dumbledore knows all about this . "" Of course you know . 
We had to ask permission for the Azkaban guards to set up detective stations around the entrance to Hogwarts . 
You are not happy about that , but you have to agree . " Not happy ? 
Why are not you glad that the guards are there to catch Black ? " Weasley's voice was heavy : " Dumbledore did not like the guards of Azkaban . 
You do not like it , if you have to line up with them ... but when dealing with a wicked insane sorcerer like Sirius Black , we also associate with the forces that normal if avoid is good . "" If they can save Harry ... "" ... then you never say anything against them . " Mr. Weasley's voice was tired : " Late at night , Molly , we go to the bedroom ... " Harry heard the chair being pushed out . 
He quickly and quietly left the corridor leading to the bar and hid there . 
The dining room door opened , and a few seconds later , footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were walking up the stairs . 
The pill under the table was where Harry had sat . 
Harry waited until he heard the door of Mrs Weasley's bedroom closed and picked up the pill bottle up the stairs . 
Fred and George were huddled in the dark corridors , chuckling as they listened to Percy searching his room and Ron for the Male Priestly Badge . 
Fred whispered to Harry : " We're holding it . 
We are modifying that badge . " The badge with the words " Player of the Year " has now become Thu Liet Son . 
Harry stretched out laughing , then took the Ronnie bottle to Ron , then locked himself in the room , lying on the bed . 
So Sirius Black is chasing it . 
So Harry understood : Mr. Fudge was tolerant of it because he was relieved to find that it was still alive . 
He forced Harry to promise to play only in the Alley , because there were many witches and wizards to look after him . 
And Fudge sent two cars to carry the Weasleys and Harry to the King's Cross station tomorrow , so that the Weasley family would take care of Harry until it was safe on the Express train . Hogwarts . 
Harry rested his silent scowls in the next room , wondering why he was still no more frightened . 
Sirius Black killed 13 people with only one curse . 
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are of the opinion that Harry would be terrified if he knew the truth . 
But Harry " accidentally " completely agreed with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was where Dumbledore was . 
Do not you always say Dumbledore is the only one that the Dark Lord Voldemort knows how afraid ? Of course Voldemort's hands like Sirius Black is also afraid of his master ! 
Then there are the Azkaban guards that everyone is talking about . 
Everyone seems to be afraid of falling down . 
But if they have to stick around to investigate around the school Sirius Black late into the new opportunity to fall inside the castle . 
No , in all of this , the thing that hurts Harry the most is his chance to visit his Hogsmeade village for the next academic year to hold his diploma . 
No one would want to get it out of the safe castle to roam somewhere when Sirius Black was not arrested . 
Not only that , it is doubtful that all of its movements will be monitored until it is believed that the danger is gone . 
Harry looked at the black ceiling . 
Do not believe that Harry can take care of himself ? 
It was three feet away from the hands of the Dark Lord Voldemort , but it was not worthless . 
Suddenly , in Harry's head , the image of the black monsters that he had met on Magnolia Crescent Street was automatically displayed . " What do you do when you know the worst thing that's going to happen ? " Harry blurted out loud , " I will not be killed . " The mirror in the sleepy room replied , " That's the will . honey . " 
CHAPTER 5 AZKABAN GHOST 
Owner Tom woke Harry up the next morning , giving him a cup of tea and greeting him with a regular smile . 
Harry was dressed up , seduced by Hedwig , and in the confines of the cage , Ron rushed into his room , walking in a sweater over his head , looking irresistible . 
" The sooner we get on the train , the better we ' ll be . 
At least in 
Hogwarts can also dodge Mr. Percy . 
Can you imagine , now the picture is telling me to go to the tea party on the picture of Penelope , the photo of you . " Ron frowned as he gestured , " just hide the face from the frame , because the nose just stains the tea . " I have something to tell you . " But Harry had just begun to be interrupted by George and Fred : they rushed into the room to congratulate Ron just once more poking Percy mad . 
They pulled down the dining room with breakfast . There Mr. Weasley sat down and was reading the Prophet's diary , with his two eyebrows forming a groove in the middle . 
Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about the Herb that she had made as a young girl . 
The three chuckled together . 
As he sat down at the table , Ron asked Harry , " What did you say earlier ? " Percy then rushed into the dining room , so Harry whispered : " for a moment . " In the chaos at the start , Harry did not . Have a chance to tell Hermione and Ron what . 
Everyone was busy carrying his huge chests down the narrow stairs of Cai Vac , and piled them near the door . 
On the pile of luggage are two owls , Hedwig and Hermes - Percy's owl - dangling on two cage ropes . 
In addition , there is a basket of rattlesnake on the edge of the chest . 
Hermione moaned to the basket : " It's a bit hard , Crookshanks . 
When you get on the train then you will release the baby . " Ron shouted : " Where is it ! 
What about my Scrabbers ? " Ron was in his pockets in his chest , the place was padded , showing Scrabbers curled up inside . 
Mr. Weasley stood outside the Ministry of Magical Vehicle waiting room . 
He poked his head in and said , " Come on , let's go , Harry . " Mr. Weasley escorted Harry across the narrow curb , toward two dark green cars , old - fashioned , There is a driver who looks cranky in jade . 
Mr. Weasley glanced down and looked up at the crowded traffic road , " You go in Harry's car . " Harry slipped into the back of a car , followed by Hermione , Ron , and one Ron was utterly disgusted with Percy . 
The journey from Cai Viek to the King's Cross station , if compared to the journey on the coach , is no problem . 
The car looks almost identical to a normal car , though Harry noticed that the car could slip through the gaps that the new car of Uncle Vernon could not do . 
They all arrived at the King Cross Station before twenty - one hours of work to prepare . 
The wizards of the Ministry of Magic went to get their children's trolleys , helped their luggage down , then raised their hands to congratulate Mr. Weasley and drove away ; I do not know how the two cars jumped up to the top of the line of cars are waiting for the green lights . 
Mr. Weasley remained with Harry throughout the station . 
He looked around and said , " Okay . 
Now we are in the yard , one by one , because we are too crowded . 
I will be with Harry first . " Mr. Weasley hurried toward the fence in the middle of platform number 9 and platform number 10 , pushing the side of Harry's luggage . 
He saw the train at Intercity City 125 then entered the station number 9 . 
Talking to Harry with a meaningful look , Mr. Weasley casually leaned against the barricade . 
Harry imitated him . 
Just a moment later , both of them pierced through the metal plate , falling to one side of the nine - fourths platform . 
The two looked up , saw the Hogwarts Express , its purple head locomotive exhausted on a crowded platform , the witches were sending their children to school . 
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry . 
They both gasped , perhaps because they had run through the barricade . 
But Percy stroked her hair and regained her blush : " Ah , Penelope ! " Ginny caught Harry's gaze and they both looked away to hide their laughter as Percy flipped over . to the girl with long curly hair . 
She could not help but see the brand new insignia on Percy's chest , as he walked with his chest pounded out in a majestic manner . 
As all the remaining members of the Weasley family together with Hermione had gathered , Mr. Weasley and Harry led the delegation to the end of the train , past crowded cars , looking for a prescription . seems empty . 
Everybody loaded their luggage onto the train , stuffed the Hedwig cage and Crookshanks basket full of luggage , then turned to the door of the farewell Mr. and Mrs. Weasley . 
Mrs. Weasley kissed her goodbye , kissed Hermione , and finally Harry . 
She embraces Harry in embarrassment , but feels extremely happy about the " added " hug . 
When Mrs. Weasley straightened up , her eyes were unusually bright , and she said , " You have to be careful , can not you hear Harry ? " Then she opened her huge bag , taking out a whole store of food . " Mom made burgers for all of you , this is your baby , Ron ... 
No , that is not salt beef ... 
Fred , where is Fred ? 
This is me , dear ... " Mr. Weasley whispered , " Harry , come here with me a little . " He nodded toward a huge pillar , Harry followed him , separated from the crowd surrounded by Mrs. Weasley . 
In a strained voice , Mr. Weasley said , " There's one thing I want to talk to you about before I go ... " Harry said , " It's okay , you know , I know . " " I know . To 
How do you know ? " " Grandchildren ... 
Oh ... I heard your uncle and uncle talk last night . 
I overheard it . " He added , " I'm sorry . " Mr. Weasley looked worried . " Well , I'm not going to let myself discover it that way . " 
" Yes , it's alright ... I feel so good . 
So I did not break Fudge's promise that I still knew what was going on . "" Harry , I'm sure you were scared , did not you ... "" Yes , no . " Harry's voice was very honest . 
He added that seeing Mr Weasley was unbelieving at all : " Actually , I do not mean to be a hero , but I'm serious , Sirius Black is not as scary as Voldemort , is he ? " Weasley was a little weepy when he heard the name Everyone knew someone , but tried to ignore it . " Harry , I know you are ... well , you're more of a fighter than Fudge thinks , and obviously I'm very pleased that you're not scared , but ... " Mrs. Weasley was All the children on board , she called : " Brother Arthur ! 
What are you doing , Arthur ? 
The train is about to arrive ! " Mr. Weasley said to his wife , " Harry is here , Molly . " In a voice that was smaller and more urgent , Mr. Weasley continued to say to Harry , " I heard you say this , I promise you a word ... " Harry continued with dismay . Will you be obedient in the castle , do not you ? " Mr. Weasley's face was solemn in a way Harry had never seen before : " Not really . 
Harry , promise me you will not go for Sirius Black ! " Harry , shocked : " What ? " A loud whistle sounded . 
The station attendants walked along the train , closing all the doors . 
Mr. Weasley said even more , " Promise me , Harry , no matter what happens ... " Harry said wryly , " Why do you have to go to find the fucker who killed me ? "" Swear to me no matter what you hear ... " Mrs. Weasley screamed , " Arthur ! 
Hurry up ! " The steam has rolled up in the engine . 
The train begins to turn . 
Harry rushed to the door , Ron opened the door and step back to Harry to climb . 
The children waving through the window waving to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were still standing in the station until the train was missing at the turn . 
As the train speeded up , Harry whispered to Ron and Hermione , " I need to talk to you privately . " Ron said to Ginny , " Go away , Ginny ! " Ginny trailed off . Are you so cute ? " Harry , Ron , and Hermione lugged down the hallway , looking for an empty carriage , but none of them were full of men except for the train's end . 
The only one passenger was sleeping by the window . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione carefully examined the door . 
The Hogwarts Express is usually reserved for students , and they have never met an adult on board , except the witch drives the car for food . 
Strange passengers wearing a witch suit extremely pathetic , te tua like loom , patch in many places . 
He looked sick and exhausted . 
Despite his youthful look , his light brown hair was mottled with silver . 
When they closed the door , picked the bench off the top of the window to sit down , Ron whispered , " You know who he is ? " Hermione whispered , " Professor R . 
J . Lupine . " How did you know ? " Hermione pointed to the luggage compartment above her passenger's head and said , " There's a note on his suitcase . " Harry and Ron looked up and saw a suitcase torn with wires tied to the knot . 
The tag was labeled " Professor R . 
J . Lupine is glued to a corner . 
Ron looked at Lupine's pale , tilted face , " What do you teach him ? " Hermione whispered : " That's so obvious ! " Harry , Ron , and Hermione had studied with the two anti - artistic anti - art professors , both of whom did not last more than one school year . 
It is rumored that the subject matter has been undermined . 
" Oh , I hope he teaches that . 
If only a spell was left , then it was enough to kill him , right ? Oh ... " He remembered , turning back to Harry : " What are you going to say to us ? " Harry narrated the argument between him and Mrs. Weasley and the words that Weasley had advised him . 
When Harry finished speaking , Ron seemed to have been struck by lightning , and Hermione blocked both of his hands into his open mouth . 
Finally , she lowered her hands to say : " Sirius Black escape to find you pay ? 
Oh , Harry ... you must be very careful , very careful . 
Do not go head - to - toe with Harry ... " Harry said , " I did not get in trouble . 
It is a problem that just hit me . " Ron was trembling and said , " Harry must be an extremely stupid fool to get the fuck out of me . " Seeing Hermione and Ron receiving that information was more pessimistic than Harry thought . 
Both Hermione and Ron all seem scared of Sirius Black than Harry a lot . 
" No one knows what Sirius Black has done to break the Azkaban prison for defection . 
No one has ever done that before . 
And he's an extremely well - guarded prisoner , not a player ! " Hermione said earnestly , " But people will catch him again , will not they ? I mean , they warned all Muggles to watch him ... " Suddenly Ron asked , " What is that sound ? " 
That sounds like a whistling sound . 
The three boys looked around the carriage . 
" It came from your chest , Harry ! " Ron stood up and reached for the luggage compartment . 
A moment later , it took from Harry's lapel a tip of a Pocket Tiara . 
The glass of that glass was spinning blindly in Ron's palm , glowing brightly . 
Hermione seemed very interested , she stood up to see clearly : " Is that a Pocket Tiara ? " Ron said : " Oh ... you do not notice , just a very good item . cheap money . 
It was also a whirlwind when he forced it down to Errol to send to Harry . " Asked Hermione in a sly chuckle . " You were doing something wrong now ? "" No ! Yeah ... it's just ... I'm not really allowed to use Errol . 
You know , it does not have the power to send long letters ... but how else do you know how to send gifts to Harry ? " The Pocket Tape Dispenser made a hissing whistle . 
" Just shove it in , " he said , " and wake him up . " Harry nodded to Professor Lupine . 
Ron tucked his Tent of Glass out of the bag of Vernon Uncle Vernon's exotic old socks , so that the hissing sound of it . 
Ron closed the chest and sat down on the bench , saying , " We ' ll bring it to Hogsmeade Village to check it out . 
Some of the magic tools like that are so much sold in Banges , and Fred and George tell me that . " Asked Hermione eagerly . " Do you know a lot about Hogsmeade ? I have read , said that it is the only place in England full of resident witches . " Ron said , not hiding : " Yes , I know that too . 
But that was not the reason I wanted to go there . 
I just want to go there to be the Duke ! "" What is that ? " A dream appeared on Ron's face . 
He said , " It's a candy store . 
There they have everything ... 
I love chili , it makes smoke smoke mouth always . 
Then is the fatty strawberry full of jam and cream ; sweet goose pens with which you could sit and suck it in class and still seem to be thinking about that essay writing ... " Hermione asked eagerly , " But Hogsmeade is a very interesting place , right ? 
In The History of Witchcraft says that the inn was the base of the rebel eclipse in 1612 , and the tent was considered the most haunted building in England ... "" ... And the huge ice cream balls that you will be able to rise up half a foot across the ground . " Obviously Ron was still dreaming in Duke's shop , not Hermione . 
Hermione looked at Harry : " Getting out of the Hogsmeade school is an interesting one , " Harry said gravely . " I hope so . 
As long as you go about remembering to tell yourself that you have discovered 
what is home " Ron was surprised : " What do you mean by that ? " I'm not allowed to go . 
Uncle Vernon and Uncle refused to sign his license . 
And Fudge did not sign . " Ron was horrified by this : " You are not allowed to go to the Hogsmeade village ? 
But ... no way ... 
Professor McGonagall or someone will allow you ... " Harry laughed . 
Professor McGonagall , Gryffindor's homeroom teacher , knows everyone is a very serious celebrity . 
" ... or we're going to ask Fred and George , two photos of all the way down the halls ... " Hermione was solemn : " Ron ! 
I think Harry should not be sneaking away from the castle while Sirius Black is outlawed . " Oh , I know how Professor McGonagall would say the same thing when I asked for permission ... " Ron said enthusiastically to Hermione . " But if we go with Harry , Black would not dare ... "" Oh , Ron , do not talk foolishly . " Hermione interrupted Ron . " Black dared to kill all the people in the busy street during the day , perhaps he would not dare attack Harry just because of his two children next door ? " She said as she opened the lid of Crookshanks ' basket . 
Ron shouted , " Do not drop that baby ! " But it was too late . 
Crookshanks crouched lightly out of the basket , stretched his shoulders , twisted his body , yawned , and jumped on Ron's knees . 
The thug in Ron's pocket was trembling like a dry crop . 
Ron threw the cat away : " go away ! " Hermione angrily shouted : " Ron , do not ! " Ron argued to Hermione , then Professor Lupine turned himself . 
The three little children watched him alertly , but he simply turned to the other side , his mouth slightly open , and he slept again . 
The Hogwarts Express runs north . 
The scenery outside the window is a wilderness , and becomes louder when the clouds are high and thick . 
The children were chasing each other , running back and forth outside Harry's presidential door , Ron and Hermione . 
Crookshanks are now seated on an empty bench . 
His flat face turned to Ron , his golden eyes clawing at Ron's shirt pocket . 
About an hour or so , a mysterious sorceress pushed the car to the door of the three of them . 
Ron nodded toward Professor Lupine , who was awkwardly asking , " Do not you think you should wake him up ? 
She also needs to eat . " Hermione carefully approached Professor Lupine . 
She cleared her throat . 
Professor ? 
Sorry Professor ? " He did not want to move . 
The witch said so : " Do not worry , dear . 
If you wake up hungry , he can find me in the first car , 
the driver's seat . " She handed Harry a stack of cauldrons . 
When she was out selling food and closing the door , Ron stared at Professor Lupine , quietly saying , " I'm sure he just sleeps ... he's not dead yet ? " Hermione took Harry's bread , " No , no , he's breathing , " said Professor Lupine , not a pleasant companion , but his presence in the car was good . 
Late in the afternoon , it began to rain , obscuring all the hills and mountains outside the window of the train . 
Then suddenly the three little children heard footsteps coming outside their carriages . 
And then there are those who are least likely to meet most of all at Hogwarts . It was Draco Malfoy , and alongside him were two cronies : Crabbe and Goyle . 
On their first journey on the Hogwarts , Malfoy and Harry became enemies . 
Now , this sharp , pallid , and contemptuous student has made the Quidditch Slytherin , like Harry , Gryffindor's Quidditch Squad . 
The two Crabbe and Goyle seem to have been born just to obey Malfoy . 
Both men are big , but Crabbe is a bit taller , with a flattened neck , hair cut as flat as coconut . 
Goyle's short , jagged hair stood up on his head , and his long arms were like the oranges . 
Pulling the door of the carriage , Malfoy took up the usual sloppy voice of him : " Oh , come on here , come on . 
Harry Potter and the Ron Monster ! " Crabbe and Goyle smiled at Malfoy . " Did I hear your father finally got yellow last summer , did not you , Weasley ? 
Have you ever had a heart attack ? " Ron stood up , so fast he threw Crookshanks ' basket onto the deck . 
At that moment Professor Lupine snorted loudly . 
Malfoy automatically takes a step back when he sees Professor Lupine . " Who's that ? " Harry was standing up straight for a moment to keep Ron . 
He said , " New teacher . 
What are you talking about , Malfoy ? " Malfoy's gray - blue eyes narrowed , and he was not so foolish as to have a fight in front of his teacher's nose . 
It frustrated the two of them , " Let's go . " And they disappeared . 
Harry and Ron sat down . 
Ron rubs the knuckles . 
" This school year I will not tolerate Malfoy anymore , I ' ll scratch my head ... " Ron raised his hand in a fierce movement in the air , Hermione pointed at Professor Lupine . , hissed , " Ron , talk carefully . " But Professor Lupine was still asleep . 
It rained increasingly , the car rushed to the north in the dim rain . 
The window frames are now just empty frames that shimmer in the rain , and then slowly darken . 
Along the corridor and on the luggage compartment , the light lantern is everywhere . 
The train swayed , the rain poured fence , wind roar ... Professor Lupine still sleep the butter . 
Ron leaned forward to peer through the now completely black window behind Professor Lupine's shoulder . 
It says : 
" We're almost there , " she said without saying when the train suddenly stopped . 
" That's great ! " Ron shouted . 
He got up , carefully passing Lupine to look out the window . 
" I'm hungry , I just want to go to the party . " Hermione watched the watch as she said , " It is not possible now to arrive ... " " So why did the train stop ? " Slower speed , slower and slower . 
As the sound of the ship sank , the sound of the rain screaming outside the window sounded more clear . 
Harry was sitting near the door and stood up to see the hallway . 
Along the railroad tracks , the curved heads of the train were everywhere . 
The Hogwarts Express suddenly stopped , and all over the wagon sounded from the chest of the trunk falling from the compartments for luggage . 
Then , without warning , all the lights on the train suddenly faded , everyone was buried in the darkness . 
Ron's voice resounded behind Harry : " What happened ? " " Ui da ! " Hermione cried , " Ron , you step on my feet ! " Harry fumbled back to his seat . 
Ron asked , " Did you think the ship was damaged ? " " Who knows ! " A shrill clanging sound , Harry glimpsed Ron's image trying to wipe a glass of glass in to try to look . go out . 
" Something is moving outside , " said Ron . 
I think maybe people are on board . " Their train doors suddenly opened , and somebody fell on Harry's leg . " Sorry ! 
Do you know what's going on ? Uhh , sorry ... "" Neville ? " Harry scrambled into the darkness , grabbed Neville's cloak , pulled him up . 
Neville was glad : " Harry there ? 
What's happening ? " I do not know anything . 
Sit down . " Neville sat down , croaking Crookshanks in the head , the cat squealing in pain . 
Hermione's voice rang out : " Let me go and ask the train driver what's going on . " Harry just felt Hermione pass by him , the carriage door opened again , and then he heard something like two sharp objects . , and the two crying out loud . " Someone ? " " Someone ? " " Ginny ? " " Hermione , right ? " " What are you doing ? " " I'm looking for Ron ... " " Here , sit down . " " Hey , this is not the place , I'm sitting here . " Neville shouted , " Ui da ! " 
Then a hoarse voice resounded , " IMHO ! " Finally , Professor Lupine was awakened . 
Harry heard his voice move in a corner . 
No child dare to look at anything . 
Suddenly a small " sound " , then the light shimmer around the car . 
Professor Lupine appears with a handful of fire in hand . 
The flame illuminated his weary gray face , but his eyes were glistening and cautious . 
In the same hoarse voice as before , Professor Lupine ordered : " Wherever you are , stay calm . " He stood up slowly , his arms extended , his hands on the fire . 
But the door opened again before Professor Lupine went to the door . 
The light from the fire in Professor Lupine's hand showed a tall hooded figure cloaking close to the roof of the car , standing just in front of the entrance . 
His face was almost hidden under the hood . 
Harry's gaze slid downward , and the sight of it made his stomach crouch . At the sleeve of his coat protruding a muddy , gray , pale , scab , and disgusting like a dead body . 
Hands revealed only in a split second . 
The animal hiding beneath the coat seemed to feel Harry's glare , his hands hidden in the black cloak . 
And the buried under the hood , not knowing what it was , just knowing it was taking a long breath to make whispers , as if trying to suck something from the air . Not just breathing the air . 
A cold air swept through everyone's face in the train . 
Harry felt his breath did not escape from his chest . 
Cold air permeating the skin , deep into Harry's lungs , heart penetration . 
Harry's eyes were upside - down , unable to see anything . 
She was immersed in the deadly cold , her ears as if it were a rush of water . 
It felt as if it was submerged in water , deep down and deep , the roar grew louder and louder ... 
And then , he heard screams from afar , the screams were extremely dire . 
He wants to help some who are miserable , no matter who he is . 
He reached out his hand , but it was completely helpless ... a faint white smoke was swirling around it , inside him ... " Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Do you ? " Someone in Harry's face . " What ... what ? " Harry opened his eyes , the lantern had glowed back over his head , and the deck was shaking . 
The Hogwarts Express departs and the light is overwhelmed by the coaches . 
Harry looked as though he had slipped off the bench , Ron and Hermione kneeling beside him . 
And over the top of his two friends Harry could see Neville's face and Professor Lupine watching him . 
Harry felt weak . 
When he pushed his right hand against the nose , he felt cold sweat pour down on his face . 
Ron and Hermione sat on the bench . 
Ron asked anxiously , " Are you all right ? " Harry looked quickly at the door , saying , " No problem . 
What happened ? 
Where ... where is it ? 
Who is screaming so badly ? " 
Ron looked even more anxious . " Who screamed ? " Harry looked around the train . 
Ginny and Neville look at it together , both pale . 
" But I heard screams ... " A loud " scream " sounded loud enough to make the kids jump up together . 
It was Professor Lupine who broke a huge chocolate bar into pieces . 
He handed Harry a large piece of paper . " Here , eat . 
Eating is not that much help . " Harry accepted the chocolate but did not eat it . 
He asked Lupine , " What is that ? " Professor Lupine handed over the chocolates to the others , responding calmly , " A dementor . 
One of the dementors of Azkaban . " Everyone looked up at the Professor . 
He crumpled the chocolate wrapping paper and stuffed it in his pocket . 
He repeated : " Eat it ! 
Eating is not good . 
I have to meet the train driver for a moment . 
Sorry ... " The professor strode past Harry , disappearing into the corridor . 
Hermione looked at Harry anxiously . 
" Do not you understand , Harry ? " Harry wiped sweat from his face , " I do not understand , what happened ? " that ... the Azkaban dictator was ... standing there looking around ... I thought he looked around , but I did not see his face ... yet you ... 
" Ron's face was still scared , Hermione said . " I thought you were faint or what was going on . 
Stopped from the seat , the face of the limbs began to twitch ... " Hermione continued : " Professor Lupine stepped over her , walking in front of the Azkaban dictator , withdrew the tree . wand of the teacher . 
He said : None of us here hides Sirius Black under the coat . scat ! 
But the Azkaban dictator has not budged . 
So Professor Lupine whispered something , a silver ray of light coming out from his wand's head aimed at the Azkaban dementor , who would turn and turn away for ... " said Neville , More than normal : " Serious is terrible . 
How do you feel when the Azkaban dictator stepped in ? " Ron shrugged uncomfortably . " I feel so weird , like I ' ll never be happy again ... " Ginny had been crouched in the corner for a moment , looking dreadfully unlucky . Harry , now new to pop out sobbing . 
Hermione rushed to her side , embraced Ginny comfortably . 
Harry still wonders , his embarrassing expression : " But ... did any of you fall to the floor ? " Ron looked at Harry anxiously . 
But Ginny was trembling . " Harry could not understand . 
He felt it trembling , weakening , as if it had been a terrible flu . 
He also began to feel embarrassed . 
Nobody's been staring at it so badly ! 
Professor Lupine returns . 
He paused a moment as he stepped into the carriage , looked around , smiled , said softly , 
" You know , I'm not poisoned in chocolate . " Harry took a bite of chocolate and he was surprised to see his body warm up , the warmth spreading to each of his fingers and toes . 
" We're going to Hogwarts in ten minutes , " said Professor Lupine . 
Will not you , Harry ? " Harry did not ask how Professor Lupine knew his name . 
He said shyly : " Well , I'm fine . " During the short distance , no one spoke again . 
Finally , as the train stopped at Hogsmeade Station , a cataclysmic chaos ensued : a snarling , coyote's cat , and under Neville's hat , his toad began to crumble . 
On the small platform , it was cold , the rain was falling on the cold curtains . " First - year students go this way ! " With that familiar voice , Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at each other , and saw Hagrid's massive figure standing at the other end of the platform . 
He was signaling and guiding the new soldiers to face the fearful faces of the first year going on the " traditional " journey across the lake . 
He screamed through the crowd : " Are you all in good health ? " The three of them raised their hands to Hagrid , but they could not have a chance to talk to him , for the crowd around them Push them forward along the platform . 
Along with all of the other Hogwarts students , Harry , Ron , and Hermione came out on a muddy road , where at least hundreds of carriages were parked , waiting for the students to be back in their second year . Castle . 
Harry guessed that each carriage was pulled by an invisible horse , because when they had climbed into the car and settled , the carriage ran , swaying and twisting all the way . 
The carriage smelled of mold and straw . 
Since eating chocolate , Harry felt better but still weak . 
Ron and Hermione kept their eyes open , as if scaring them away again . 
The lame carriage toward the magnificent gates is magnificently decorated , with two stone pillars on top of which two winged boars . 
Harry also saw two high - pitched Azkaban jailers and a hooded guard on either side . 
A cold chill chills him again . 
She leaned against the back of a rugged chair and closed her eyes until the carriage came out of the gate . 
Now the road is going downhill towards the castle so the carriage is also faster . 
Hermione was leaning over the small window of the carriage to watch the watch towers and dormitories towering up . 
At last the carriage stopped , Ron and Hermione jumped out of the car . 
As Harry set foot on the ground , he heard a plastic voice with a humming sound : " Are you freaking Potter ? 
Is Neville right ? 
Are you really sick ? " Malfoy pressed his elbows against Hermione's face to block Harry's path before he stepped onto the stone steps of the castle . 
Malfoy's face was gloomy and his eyes were full of evil dexterity . 
Harry's teeth clenched . " Get out of the way , Malfoy . " Malfoy said loudly , " Do you faint , Ron ? 
Was that disgusting old Azkaban daddy making you fall apart in pants ? " What's wrong ? " Professor Lupine's soft voice resounded as he descended from a vehicle that had come running . 
Malfoy throws insolent glances at Professor Lupine , along with his patchwork blouse and state - of - the - art suitcase . 
Malfoy said , his voice a bit sarcastic : " Oh ... 
Sir , there's nothing ... " Then he winked at Crabbe and Goyle , and led them up the stairs to the castle . 
Hermione hurried forward to hurry up , the three of them soon joined in the crowded crowd pulling the flock up the steps , stepping through the massive oak door into the lobby . The shape of the cave is lit by burning torches . 
At the end of the corridor are marble steps leading up to the floor . 
Right in the hallway lobby is the door to the Great Hall is expanding . 
Harry followed the crowd to the side . 
But he had not yet glimpsed the ceiling of the Hall which was witchcrafted into the sky , a dark sky full of clouds that night , when he heard the call : " Harry ! 
Hermione ! 
Both games here , she needs to meet . " Harry and Hermione turned around , surprised . 
Professor McGonagall , the Transformers teacher and head of the Gryffindor family , is calling the two of them through their heads in the crowd . 
Professor McGonagall was a respectable , well - educated , long - haired cursor , with a tight bun , and her sharp eyes framed in square glasses . 
Harry squeezed the way to the teacher with the hint of bad luck . 
Professor McGonagall always had a way of making Harry feel that he had done something wrong . 
But the professor said , " You do not need to worry too much . 
She only had a few words to say to her children in her office . 
Come on , Ron . " Ron glanced up at Professor McGonagall , leading Harry and Hermione away from the crowded chattering crowd . 
Both of them followed Professor McGonagall across the hallway , up the marble stairs and along a corridor . 
When all was in Professor McGonagall's office , a small room with a warm welcoming robe , the professor gave Harry and Hermione a seat . 
She also sat down behind the desk and began to say , " Professor Lupine has sent a message to the newspaper saying that I was sick on the train , did not Harry ? " But Harry did not answer , there was a knock on the wing . the door , and Mrs. Pomfrey , the school's physician , rushed to the room . 
Harry felt blush . 
Damage is not worse than when all of its movements are monitored , only faint one that has generated such noisy . 
He said , " I'm fine . 
I do not need anything ... " Mrs. Pomfrey did not care what Harry said . 
When she saw Harry exclaimed , " Oh ? 
Is that game ? " She leaned down to Harry , staring at it . 
" I'm sure that's a dangerous thing to do , is not it ? " Said Professor McGonagall , 
" Only at the Azkaban dictator , Poppy ! " Both women exchanged a mysterious glance , Pomfrey chuckled unhappily . " What school is that dementia - like Azkaban ? " She brushed Harry's hair up and touched his forehead : " This game will not be the first to faint . 
Oh , it's cold sweat all over here . 
The dementors are so scary . 
And the consequences they caused to those who were already fragile ... " Harry argued , " You are not thin . " Of course not . " Mrs. Pomfrey caught Harry , absentmindedly following him . 
Professor McGonagall asked in a determined voice : " How is this situation ? 
Do you need rest in bed ? 
Or is it possible for her to stay in the hospital tonight ? " Harry jumped up , " I'm fine ! " Just thinking of what Malfoy would have to say about him having to fall sick is enough to make Harry stand up . 
Mrs Pomfrey was looking at Harry's eyes , and she said , " Well , some girls need some chocolate , too . " 
Professor Lupine gave me a piece . 
He gave us all one piece for each of us . Mrs. Pomfrey expressed her approval , " Are you okay ? 
So in the end we also have a black martial arts teacher who specializes in first aid therapy . Professor McGonagall said , " Are you sure you're fine , Harry ? " Harry said , " Good morning . " That's good . 
I'm happy to wait outside for a moment as she speaks to Hermione about her study schedule . 
Then we will go downstairs to have dinner . " Harry went out to the porch with Mrs. Pomfrey . 
She muttered grumbling as she went back to void . 
Harry just had to wait for a few minutes . 
Hermione poked her head out of the room , her face a little excited about something . 
Stepping behind Hermione is Professor McGonagall . 
All three went down the marble stairs to enter the Great Hall . 
In the Great Hall is now a sea of ​​ black hats by the students of the witch . 
The long table is crowded with students , every face of the nose is bright in the light of thousands of suspended candles in the air . 
Professor Flitwick , a small , gray - haired professor of witchcraft , holds an old hat and a three - legged stool out of the Great Hall . 
" Oh , we're late for the Classification Ceremony ! " Said the newlyweds , who had just been assigned to the dormitories after the ceremony . Me : Gryffindor , Ravenclaw , Hufflepuff , or even Slytherin . 
Professor McGonagall strode to her empty seat at the teacher's desk . 
Harry and Hermione went in the opposite direction , toward Gryffindor's table , trying their best to walk quietly . 
And yet people also turned their heads to look at the two of them quietly around the corner of the Hall , some of whom were just Harry . 
Had the story rolled out in front of the bureaucrat Azkaban has spread so fast ? 
Harry and Hermione sat down at the two chairs Ron had flanked her . 
Ron whispered to Harry , " What is it ? " Harry began to explain in a whisper , but at that moment the Principal stood up for the opening lecture , so he paused to hear . 
Professor Dumbledore , though very old , always makes a special impression on his great powers . 
Her long hair and beard , her bright blue eyes glittering behind half - moon glasses on a crooked nose all the way . 
He was considered one of the greatest sorcerers of his time , but Harry respected Dumbledore not for that . 
Anyone who has ever met Dumbledore can not trust his place . 
When Harry looked at the bright smiling Hogwarts student , he felt reassured , for the first time since he had touched the Azkaban dictator on Hogwarts . 
Dumbledore said , " Welcome all of you back to school . " 
I have something to say to everyone here , and because one of those things is very serious , I think it's best to say it out right now , before you're filled with groaning because This is our great cat party ... " Dumbledore cleared his throat and said , " As all of you know , by the control of the Hogwarts Express , our school is The guest is the Azkaban dictator , who came here to do the mission entrusted to the Ministry of Magic . " Dumbledore stopped talking . 
Harry remembered Mr. Weasley once said that Dumbledore was not happy to welcome the Azkaban dictators to Hogwarts . 
Dumbledore continued , " They will put a guard at each gate of the school . 
During the time the Azkaban dictators stayed in our school , I wanted to make it clear that no one could leave the school without permission . 
Do not fool or cross the Azkaban dictatorships with demonic or disguise , even in invisibility cloaks . " Harry and Ron looked at each other . 
Dumbledore said quietly , " The bureaucrats of Azkaban have never been able to comprehend the pleas for excuses or excuses . 
So I have to advise each of you to sit here and do not create an excuse to harm them . 
I rely on the leaders and the new Heads of Boys and Girls , do everything possible to ensure that no student has a clash with the Azkaban dictators . " Sitting on Harry's chair a few feet from the Gryffindor's long table was the new head of the Percy Boys . 
He puffed out his chest and rolled his eyes around in a cool way . 
Dumbledore stopped talking , looking around the Hall solemnly , that no one dared to speak or make a small noise . 
He continued , " There is another happy message . 
I am happy to welcome two new teachers to join our school's teaching staff . 
The first is Professor Lupine , 
The generous man agreed to fill the vacancy at the Anti - Art Department . " The clap of clapping sounded , not very warm . 
Only the pupils were accompanied by a train wagon with Professor Lupine ardently clapping hands , including Harry . 
Sitting next to the other professors in their slacks , Professor Lupine looks extremely sloppy . 
" Snape Snape , " snapped Professor Snape , the professor of poison , sitting at the professor's desk glaring at Professor Lupine . 
It is well known that Snape mastered the position of Professor of Dark Arts Defense . 
But even the one who hated him was Harry , too , to be amazed at Snape's thin , snappy face as he looked at Professor Lupine , no longer anger - it was hate . 
Harry knew that expression very well ; Because , it was many times he was viewed by Snape with a look like that . 
Dumbledore continued after the disgusted applause greeted Lupine . " The assignment to the second teacher position this school year is ... 
Yes , I regret to inform you that Professor Kettleburn , professor of mastectomy care , retired at the end of last school year , to spend more time caring for his remaining sisters . 
However , I am pleased to announce that Kettleburn's position was replaced by Rubeus Hagrid himself , who agreed to take on this new task in addition to keeping our Hogwarts lock . " All three , Harry , Ron and Hermione , stared at each other . 
Immediately afterwards , they clapped their hands like mad , accompanying loud applause in the Gryffindor crowd . 
Harry leaned forward and looked at Hagrid clearly . 
He was blushing as if he had drunk a bottle of wine , his eyes glumly staring down at his large hands . 
Certainly he was happy , but his grinning smile was hidden behind the thick , dark beard that covered his face . 
" We should have guessed , " Ron patted on the desk . 
Can anyone else in the world be able to catch me with a book biting around ? " Harry , Ron , and Hermione were the last three clapping hands , as Professor Dumbledore continued to say . 
They noticed that Hagrid wiped his tears with a tablecloth . " Well , I guess that's all that matters . 
Now let the party begin ! " The gold plates and golden cups in front of everyone suddenly filled with food and drink . 
Harry suddenly felt hungry , picking up all the food that he had to eat , and eating until his new hips . 
The party was delicious at all . 
The whole Great Hall sounded laughter , forks and scissors touch each other . 
However , Harry , Ron and Hermione were eagerly awaiting the banquet so they could have a chat with Hagrid . 
They know how important it is for Hagrid to become a teacher . 
Hagrid was once considered a quality witch . 
He was kicked out of Hogwarts School when he was in his third year , fifty years ago , for being blamed for a crime he never did . 
The three Harry , Ron and Hermione contributed to justify and return the honor to Hagrid late last school year . 
And it was time to end when the last pumpkin came out of the golden plates . 
Dumbledore said that it was time for the kids to go to sleep . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione took advantage of the opportunity immediately . 
They rushed to the teacher's desk , Hermione shouted , 
" Congratulations , Hagrid ! " Hagrid grinned at his bright pink lipstick , looking up at the three children . " It's thanks to the three of us . 
You can not imagine ... Dumbledore is indeed a great man ... 
As soon as Professor Kettleburn asked for enough of the young prank and retired , Dumbledore immediately went straight to his hut ... I longed for how long this job would be ... " Trying to control His affection , Hagrid buried his face in the napkin , Professor McGonagall said they went to the bedroom . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione joined the Gryffindor students running up the marble stairs . 
And as they walk down the corridor , they begin to realize tiredness and sleepiness . 
Yet there are still stairs to climb , then to the secret door to the Gryffindor Tower . 
Mrs. Cao's huge portrait in pink dress asked them , " Password ? " From the back of the Gryffindor pupil , Percy shouted : " Let's go , let's go ! 
New password is Big Hit ! " Neville looked impatient : " Oh my parents ! " Remembering a password is always hard work for Neville . 
Through the hole behind the portraits Mrs. Beo , both of them pulled into the living room . 
School girls split up on their own stairs to the bedroom . 
Harry climbed the spiral staircase , thinking nothing but joy filled his mind that he was back to his dear school . 
She returned to the familiar circular bedroom with five mosquito net beds . 
He looked around the room with pleasure as it was his home . 
Chapter 6 MUSHROOM AND TEA 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione walked into the Great Hall to eat breakfast the next morning , the first person they saw was Draco Malfoy . 
It seems that Malfoy was entertaining a Slytherin student group with a joke . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione passed by , Malfoy was parodying a painful , unconscious expression , so that around him it burst into laughter . 
Hermione walked behind Harry , saying : 
" Shelf it . 
Just ignore it , it's not worth the bother ... " 
But Pansy Parkinson , a Slytherin baby , wrinkled like a dog's face , Pug suddenly shrieked : 
" Hey , Potter ! 
Potter , the bureaucrat Azkaban is coming ! 
Potter , Huuuuu ! " 
Harry plopped down the chair next to George at the Gryffindor table . 
George gave them some paper : 
" The third year student's schedule . 
Oh , what's up Harry ? " 
Ron sat down on the bench beside George , glaring at the Slytherin table , said , 
" Malfoy . " 
George looked up , just in time to see Malfoy again being fake again fearfully . 
George calmly said : 
" The boy is bored . 
It does not matter what the majesty of the Azkaban dictator checked the train last night . 
It also ran through our car , right Fred ? " 
Fred scowled at Malfoy : 
" scraps in pants . " 
George says : 
" You do not even like me right now . 
They are really disgusting , the Azkaban dictators ... " 
Fred said , 
" They do not have the guts to freeze it ? " 
Harry whispered : 
" But you're not faint , are you ? " 
George said strongly : 
" Forget it , Harry . 
Once you have to go to Azkaban , remember Fred ? 
He said it was the worst place he ever knew . 
Three back home shaking hands and feet and then always sick ... 
The Azkaban diarrhea smokes joy from the prison . 
In it , almost all the prisoners of Azkaban go mad . " 
Fred changed topic : 
" Oh , to see how Malfoy would be happy after the first Quidditch match . 
Remember ? 
The early Quidditch match was between the Gryffindor and the Slytherin . " 
The only time that Harry and Malfoy faced each other in a Quidditch match was that Malfoy had been ordered to retreat . 
Recalling that battle , Harry felt a little upbeat , then grab yourself a few sausages and tomatoes fried . 
Hermione also studied the new timetable . 
She exclaimed , 
" Oh , that's great ! 
We started learning new things today . " 
Ron peered over Hermione's shoulder and read his serious face . 
It says : 
" Hermione , people mess up your schedule . 
In a word , they give you up to ten subjects a day . 
Do not have enough time . " 
" I will manage . 
I settled with Professor McGonagall . " 
Ron laughed , saying : 
" But do you think you saw the schedule this morning ? 
Nine hours of Prophecy . 
And right below , nine hours , Muggle - learn . 
And ... " 
Ron leaned closer to the timetable , unable to believe : 
Look , just below that line : arithmetic , also nine hours . 
I say I know you , Hermione , but no one can be so good . 
How can you study at three different classes at the same time ? " 
Said Hermione curtly : 
" do not be stupid . 
Of course I will not be studying in all three classes at the same time . " 
" Then ... " 
Hermione interrupted : 
" Please give me jar . " 
" But ... " 
Cried Hermione . 
" Oh , Ron , if your schedule is a bit full , what's up with you ? 
I told you , I've made a deal with Professor McGonagall ! " 
At that moment , Hagrid stepped into the Great Hall . 
He wore a long coat of molehawk , and he ignored the skunk body in his big hand . 
On the way to the teacher's desk , he stopped talking to the children : 
" Okay ? 
You were the first class students you taught to hear ! 
Class begins soon after lunch ! 
Uncle wake up at five in the morning to prepare everything ready ... 
Hope is not there ... here , a teacher ... really ... " 
He grinned at the children and went to the teacher's table , still waving his skunk . 
With a little anxiety in his voice , Ron wondered : 
" What kind of thing is she prepared for ? " The hall began to be empty as people rushed to her first class . 
Ron watches his schedule : 
" We have to go , to see , the class of the Prophet on the top floor of the North Tower . 
We would take ten minutes to get there ... " 
They hurry to finish breakfast , say goodbye to Fred and George , then back out , across the Hall . 
As they passed the Slytherin table , Malfoy performed a fake attack . 
Laughter chased Harry into the hall . 
Journey through the castle to the North Tower is a long journey . 
Two years at Hogwarts were not enough for the kids to know everything about the castle : they had never been inside the Tower before . 
The little lad climbed to the seventh stairway , to the end of a stairwell that was not familiar , there was nothing but a large picture of an empty lawn hanging from the stone wall , Ron gasped just said : 
" Yes ... yes ... a ... way ... 
come on ... off ! " 
Hermione looked down at an empty corridor on her right : 
" Surely this way . " 
But Ron said , 
" No , it's south . 
You see , we can see a piece of water outside the window ... " 
Harry looks at the picture . 
A chubby , gray - feathered gray ponytail , stumbling on the lawn and poaching green grass . 
Although accustomed to the characters in the Hogwarts paintings are constantly moving around and occasionally leave the frame to visit each other , but Harry is still looking at them . 
Shortly thereafter , a dwarf knight in armor cries out as he enters the painting , followed by a dwarf horse . 
Based on the traces of grass on the knee of the metal armor he was wearing , it can be said that he just fell off the horse . 
Seeing Harry , Ron and Hermione , the knight shouted : 
" Ah ! 
Which dishonest dare to penetrate my own domain ? 
Do you laugh at me ? 
Draw the sword , dishonest , dog ! " 
The staggering little children stood looking out at the knight who was pulling the sword out of the shell and began swinging his sword aggressively , his legs jumping in mad rage . 
But the blade was too long compared to his slender body , and when he had sliced ​​ a sharp sword , the sword went to him , losing his balance , falling to his feet , his face down on the grass . 
Harry approached the painting , asking : 
" Are you alright ? " 
" Back ! 
Foolish bastard ! 
Back ! loofah ! " 
The knight clutched his sword to stand up , but the blade sank deeper into the grass , and when he got up , despite his best efforts , he could not draw the sword . come out again . 
Finally he had to throw himself to the grass , pushed the veil over the iron hats to wipe away the sweat was swirling . 
Exhilarated knight rested tired , Harry apologized : 
" Like this , we are looking for the North Tower . 
You do not know where that is ? " 
The knight's anger seemed to disappear instantly . 
He stood up and yelled , 
" A search ! 
Follow me , friends ! 
We will find your goal , or we will bravely die for duty ! " 
The knight once again tried to pull out the sword ineffectively , then tried to climb the fat horse , but fell back . 
He screamed out loud : 
" walk , ladies and gentlemen ! 
Let's go ! 
Come on ! " 
And , in his armor ringing , he ran to the left of the picture frame and disappeared from the scene of the painting . 
The three little children ran after the knight along the corridor , according to the sound of the gleam of his armor . 
Sometimes they see him running across a picture in front . 
" Try to be brave , the worst is not happening ! " 
The knight screamed , and they found him reappearing in front of a group of mournful ladies . 
Paintings of women hanging on the walls of a staircase twisted oblique . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione gasped and climbed up the narrow twisted stairs , more and more dizzy , until they heard the murmur above their heads , knowing they had reached the classroom . 
The knight at the head of a painting of a very sinister priest , shouting : 
" Goodbye ! 
Goodbye , my friends ! 
Whenever you need a noble heart and steel muscles , go to Mr. Cadogan ! " 
When the knight vanished , Ron murmured : 
" As long as we need a guy who's down , how are we going to call him ? " 
They climbed the last few steps , set foot on a tiny staircase , where almost all of the Prophet's classes had gathered . 
Do not see any door open from the top of this stairs . 
Ron raised his elbows , pointing to the ceiling , on which had a rounded trapdoor , with a bronze card . 
Harry reads : 
" Sybill Trelawney , teacher of the Prophecy ... 
How can we get up there now ? " 
As if to answer Harry's question , the trapdoor suddenly opens , and a silver ladder is dropped down at Harry's feet . 
Everyone stopped crying . 
Ron grinned . 
" Give up before you . " 
Harry climbed up first , entering the strangest classroom ever . 
In fact , it is not like a little classroom ; but somewhere like a loft of a house , just like an old tea shop . 
There were at least two dozen small round tables in the room , surrounded by colorful cloth chairs and small cushions of thick mattresses . 
Everything is illuminated by red lights . 
All the windows were closed and many of the lights were sealed with red scarves . 
The room was warm and stuffy , and under the mantelpiece filled with things , a flame was heating up a large copper kettle , radiating a pungent odor to the sickness . 
The shelves placed along the wall rounded up the clutter of dusty feathered feathers , crumbled candles , many piledrings , countless silver glass spheres , and an army of tea pots . rear . 
The class was gathering in the room , everyone was whispering . 
Ron came close to Harry's shoulders , asking : 
" Where's the teacher ? " 
Suddenly a voice came from the darkness , a small , vague voice : 
" Welcome to the game . 
It is a pleasure to meet you in the material world . " 
The impression of Harry at that moment is that of a large , brilliant insect . 
Professor Trelawney moved into the area with a fire , and the children noticed that her teacher was sick and had glasses , which enlarged her eyes much larger than her natural size , and she wrapped one . Shawl shawl is decorated with gold leaf . 
Around her slender neck was a myriad of necklaces and beads , while her arms , hands and fingers wore rings with rings . 
She said : 
" Sit down , sit down . " 
The clumsily clambered up on the couches or sat in cushions . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione sat around a round table . 
Professor Trelawney sat himself in a winged armchair in front of the fireplace . 
She said : 
" Welcome to the subject of Prophecy . 
My name is Professor Trelawney . 
Previously perhaps the game has never met me . 
Because if I go down too often , the clutter of the school can blur my Inner Vision . " 
No one said anything in response to that unusual message . 
Professor Trelawney gently tweaked the shawl and said , 
" So you have chosen to study the Prophet , the most difficult subject in the mysterious arts . 
I would like to note from the beginning that if you do not have a look , then I will not be able to teach you much . 
Books do not help much in this area where ... " 
Hearing these words , Harry and Ron both grinned and glanced at Hermione , who was shocked at the fact that the book was not helpful in learning the subject . 
" Many witches and wizards , though talented in areas like explosions , are good at guessing and disappearing abruptly , yet can not see through the hidden secrets of the future . " 
The professor's dreamy eyes fluttered from one tense face to the other's anxious face , continuing : 
" It's natural , just for a few people . " Suddenly she told Neville : 
" This game , how grandmother is good ? " 
Neville nearly fell out of the pillow he was sitting on . 
It trembled with shock : 
" Well , I think you're fine . " 
Professor Trelawney shook her head , glinting with sparkles on her dangling emerald earrings : 
" If I were a game , I would not be so sure . " 
Neville choked . 
Professor Trelawney remained calm at the moment : 
" We will study the basic methods of the Prophet in this school year . 
A semester will be devoted to learning how to read tea leaves . 
Next semester we will go to Handwriting . 
By the way I say this ... " The professor suddenly looked at Parvati Patil . 
" ... Beware of a redhead . " 
Parvati turned to look at Ron sitting next to him , then pushed his chair away . 
Professor Trelawney continues : 
" In the coming summer semester , we study up to the study of the crystal ball - that is , after we have finished our fire - test . 
Unfortunately , our class will be suspended in February because of an uncomfortable flu . 
We will lose our voice ourselves . 
And close to Easter , one of us will leave us permanently . " 
After this prophecy was a tense silence , but Professor Trelawney did not seem to notice it . 
She told Lavender Brown , who was sitting near her grandmother and almost crouched in an armchair : 
" Please give me the biggest silver tea pot . " 
Lavender seemed to howl , stood up , took the teapot on the shelf and placed it on the table in front of Professor Trelawney . 
" Thank you . 
Surprisingly , what you are afraid of ... that will happen on Friday , October 16 . " 
Lavender trembled . 
" Now , I want the games to be divided into pairs . 
Take a cup of tea on the shelf , and then here I filled the tea . 
Then they sat down and drank ; Drink until only the tea leaves in the cup . 
Use your left hand to rinse tea leaves in three times , then cup on the plate . Wait for the tea to drop the last drop of water to give your cup to your friend fortune telling . 
The games will follow pages 5 and 6 of the screen to reveal the meaning of the tea leaves . 
I will go around the game to help , guide . 
Oh my baby ... " 
Professor grabbed Neville's arm , pulled it up , 
" ... after you broke the first cup , please choose a cup of green pattern . 
I am more suited to pink . " 
Then , Neville had just reached the shelf to get a cup of tea to hear a crack of the tank . 
Professor Trelawney walked to Neville , taking a garbage and broom , and said , 
" One of the blue ones , that's right , you ... if you do not mind ... thank you ... " 
When the tea of ​​ Harry and Ron was filled with tea , they returned to their table , trying to drink the teaspoon quickly . 
Then they pour the tea in the cup as instructed by Professor Trelawney , then back up the cup of tea to drain them together for the fortune telling . 
Both of them opened the book to pages 5 and 6 . Ron said : 
" here it is . 
What do you see in your teacup ? " 
Harry replied , 
" A brown tangle . " 
A heavy smelling smoke in the room suddenly made Harry feel sleepy and dull . 
Professor Trelawney called after the foggy tea : 
" Open your mind , let your eyes see through the mundane world ! " 
Harry tried to concentrate . 
After referring to the Proclamation of the Future , it says : 
" Yes , you have a shabby cross ... that means you're going to have to go through " trials and tribulations " - sorry - but there is a sign that may be the sun . 
to see ... it means " great happiness " ... so you are going to suffer but will be happy ... " 
Said Ron : 
" In your opinion , you need to check your Inner Lab . " 
Both of them had to compress their laughter because Professor Trelawney was glaring at them . 
" Now comes your turn ... " 
Ron looked at Harry's cup , his forehead creasing the thought of evil . 
" There's a round shape that looks a bit like a melon hat . 
Maybe you are going to work for the Ministry of Magic ... " 
It rotates the cup of tea to look back . 
" But that looks like an oak ... what is it ? " 
Ron scans the screen of the future . 
" The sky is so bright . " 
Can you borrow a little ? 
There is something else here . " 
Ron turned the cup again . 
" Looks like an animal . 
Oh , yes , this animal's head ... it's like a hippopotamus ... no , a sheep ... " 
Harry let out a laugh at the time Professor Trelawney was around it . 
She said with a scowl to Ron : 
" Take me to that , that game . " 
The professor walks up , twisting Harry's cup from Ron's hand , everyone becomes silent , waiting to see . 
" The professor stared at the cup , turning it counterclockwise : 
" Baby ... I love you , I have a mortal . " 
Hermione whispered slightly : 
" But everyone knows that . " 
The professor scowled back at the girl . 
Hermione continued : 
" Yes , everyone knows . 
Everyone knows that Harry and Everyone are known to somebody . " 
Harry and Ron looked at Hermione with wonder and admiration . 
They never heard Hermione talk to the teacher in such a voice . 
Professor Trelawney chose to ignore her . 
She lowered her huge eyes to Harry's cup , and continued to spin the cup . 
" Bareback ... an attack . 
My dear , this is not a good cup of tea ... " 
Shouted Ron , 
" I think it's a melon hat . " 
" Scary ... danger on the way , baby ... " 
All the children in the class looked at Professor Trelawney with terrified death . 
She turned the last cup , gasped , and screamed . 
A loud crack of porcelain broke out ; Neville had just drained his second cup . 
Professor Trelawney sat down on an empty armchair , her sparkling hand pressed against her heart and her eyes shut . 
" Oh , my son , my dear son ... no , no , it's better ... no , do not ask me more ... " 
Dean Thomas immediately asked : 
" What is it , Professor ? " 
Everyone was standing up , slowly rolling around Harry and Ron's desk , pressed against the armchair that Professor Trelawney was sitting in , staring at Harry's tea . 
Professor Trelawney's huge eyes suddenly opened dramatically : 
" My dear , I have a bad temper . " 
Harry asked again . 
" What is it ? " 
It can be said that it is not alone that it does not know what it is . 
Dean Thomas shrugged his shoulders , and Lavender Brown looked confused . 
But a lot of the others were obviously aware , they raised their hands and gagged with utmost panic . 
Professor Trelawney shouted : 
" My dear son , my dear son , I was hungry ! " 
Professor Trelawney seemed so excited that Harry could not understand . 
She said : 
" The giant dog ghost is often in the graveyard ! 
Dear son , that is a badge - the worst virtue - death ! " 
Harry's stomach aches . 
The dog , on the cover of the Deathly Hallows book at the bookstore , and the dog - in the shadow of Magnolia . 
Lavender Brown hands her mouth back . 
Everyone looked at Harry . 
Everyone , except Hermione . 
She got up , walked around behind Professor Trelawney's chair , bluntly said , 
" I do not feel like it . " 
Professor Trelawney scrutinized Hermione with an increasingly unpleasant expression . 
" Dear child , I forgive you when I say this , but I notice very little exclamation around my body . 
There is little possibility of digestion for the resonance of the ear . " 
Seamus cut his head to one side and turned his head to the other . 
She said , a squinted eye : 
" If I look like this , it's like a hen , " 
She leaned to the left and said , 
" But if you look from here , it's more like a donkey . " 
Harry found himself surprised . 
Now no one seems to want to see it . 
It says : 
" As long as you and your friends decide that I'm going to die or not ? " 
Professor Trelawney said , in her most ambiguous voice : 
" I suppose we should stop today's lesson here . 
Yes ... Please return the furniture to the right place ... " 
The class quietly brought the cup back to Professor Trelawney and collected books in pairs . 
Even Ron avoided Harry's gaze . 
Professor Trelawney said weakly : 
" Appointment until we meet again , bless you . 
Oh my darling ... " 
The professor points to Neville : 
" Next time I ' ll be late , so try to work harder to keep up . " Harry , Ron and Hermione climbed down Trelawney's ladder and down the stairs , in silence , The class of Professor McGonagall . 
They spent so much time looking for classrooms that even though they left the Prophet's class early on , when entering the study hall of the Transfiguration , it was just in time for the new class . 
Harry picked up a chair at the end of the classroom , feeling as though he were sitting in a well - lit location ; The whole class seemed to just throw a glance at him , as if he was about to fall dead at any moment . 
Harry hardly heard what Professor McGonagall had to say about Amimagi - witches capable of turning into animals at will . 
He did not even look when Professor McGonagall turned himself into a cat lover and eyed his eyes in front of the kids . 
When she returned to her original form after a brief " small " explosion , she wondered about the students : 
" Honestly , what are you all doing today ? 
It was not a problem , but it was the first time that the class did not clap in front of her transformation . " 
Everyone heads toward Harry , but no one says anything . 
Then , Hermione raised her hand : 
" Dear , we just learned our first class , and we learned tea leaves , and ... " 
Professor McGonagall was serious : 
" Ah , that's it . 
Needless to say , Hermione . 
The game tells me to hear , who among you will die this year ? " 
Everyone looked up at Professor McGonagall . 
Finally , Harry said , 
" Dear , dear . " 
Professor McGonagall stared at Harry with his eyes gleaming : 
" That's so . 
So you should understand , Harry , since Professor Trelawney came to this school , every year she predicted the death of a student . 
None of them died . 
Seeing the ominous sign is the way Trelawney liked to spend the night celebrating a new class . 
She never wanted to say bad things about her colleague , but ... " 
Professor McGonagall stopped talking , her nose pale . 
She continued , calmer : 
" The Prophet was one of the most inaccurate of the sorcerers . 
She does not hide her child that she has very little patience with the subject . 
Very rare prophets and Professor Trelawney ... " 
Professor McGonagall stopped again , then spoke again in two distinct years : 
" You see my health is very good , Harry , so I ' ll give it up for you if you do not give me your exercise today . 
She assured me that if she died , she would not need to submit her papers . " 
Hermione laughed . 
Harry feels better . 
It is hard to be afraid of a cup of tea when one is no longer in the context of Professor Trelawney's class : dark red light and a kind of smell that causes people to stumble . 
However , not everyone believes in McGonagall . 
Ron looked very anxious . 
And Lavender is still rumbling : 
" But what about Neville's cups ? " 
At the end of the class , the children enter the crowded barrack to the Great Hall for lunch . 
Hermione pushes a casserole dish toward Ron : 
" Come on , Ron . 
You've heard Professor McGonagall say that . " 
Ron scooped some spoonfuls of casseroles for his plate , picked up his fork , but could not eat . 
It speaks in a small and serious voice : 
" Harry , you never saw a big black dog anywhere , did you ? " 
Harry said : 
" Yes , I see . 
The night I left Dursleys home , I saw a child . " 
Ron dropped his fork and dropped the fork . 
Hermione remained calm : 
" Maybe a wild dog . " 
Ron looked at Hermione as if she had lost her mind . 
" Hermione , if Harry had ever seen Horror , then ... it was too bad . 
You ... my boy Bilius saw one and ... he died within twenty four hours ! " 
Hermione poured herself a pumpkin juice , happily saying : 
" Random coincidence that ! " 
Ron started to get angry : 
" You do not know what you're talking about ? 
Horror makes every witch also afraid of falling smoke always . " 
Hermione voices sister Two : 
" Then you're right , they see , and they die in fear . 
Horror is not a death sentence but a cause of death ! 
And Harry is still with us because he is not so foolish as to see an evil thought : stop it , I'm dying for it . " 
Ron opened his mouth to Hermione but could not speak . 
Hermione opened her bag and took out a brand new Arithmetic , opened it , and put the book in the juice container . 
She searched the page and said : 
" I see the Prophet is too vague . 
I guess too much . " 
Ron hotly said : 
" There is nothing vague about that cup in the cup ! " 
Hermione : 
" You do not have that confidence when you tell Harry it's a sheep . " 
" Professor Trelawney says that he has very little elixir ! 
You do not like to have a bad subject at all . " 
Ron hit the right side of the sting . 
Hermione flipped the Arithmetic to the table , so strong that the pieces of casseroles and carrots spread out . 
" If I was good at Prophecy , would I pretend to see death in a leaf of tea ? 
If so then I'm not sure if I will continue to study that subject anymore ! 
That lesson compared to my arithmetic class is like rubbish ! " 
She reached for her bag and left . 
Ron scowled at her , and said to Harry , 
" What is Hermione ? 
What kind of arithmetic did he study ? " 
* * * * 
After lunch , Harry was glad to get out of the castle . 
The rain had stopped last night ; The sky is clear , and the grass is soft and damp , soft as it passes through the yard , to the first session of the mysterious Creature Care class . 
Ron and Hermione did not even talk to each other . 
Harry walked silently alongside the two of them as they walked down the grass to Hagrid's cottage on the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
When they saw three too - familiar backs in front of them , Harry realized that they would have to study this subject with the Slytherin students . 
Malfoy was excitedly talking to Crabbe and Goyle , making them laugh as well . 
Harry made sure we knew what they were talking about . 
Hagrid stood in front of the hut to welcome the students to his class , hovering in the moleskin's cloak , the hunting dog Fang standing close to his master , seemed restless as if he could not wait for the moment to begin . . 
Hagrid called : 
" Come here , come over ! " 
The student approached the old man . 
" Today , I treat you to a meal ! 
The game is going to learn a great lesson ! 
Are there enough people ? Okay , follow me . " 
For a moment , Harry thought Hagrid was leading the group in the forest . 
The miserable experiences that Harry had experienced in that forest were enough to remember him for a lifetime . 
However , Hagrid led them around the tree , and five minutes later everyone noticed that they were standing outside a place that looked like a small horse ranch . 
But there were no children inside . 
Hagrid called : 
" Let's all gather around the fence ! 
So - sure enough to see clearly . 
Now , the first thing all you have to do is open the book ... " 
" How ? " 
Malfoy's voice resounded , plastic cold . 
Hagrid asked : 
" Huh ? " 
Malfoy repeats : 
" How do you open the book ? " 
Malfoy pulls out his Monster Monster . 
The book was marked with a long rope . 
The other pupils also pulled out their books , some of them just like Harry had used the harness that muzzle the book . 
Others put the book in tight caps , or clamped it together with paper clips . 
Hagrid looks pensive : 
" No one can open the book ? " 
The class shook his head . 
Said Hagrid . 
" You have to stroke them . 
Looks like ... " 
Hagrid's voice was the most obvious thing in the world . 
He picked up Hermione's book , stripped of glue from the spit . 
The book tried to bite , but Hagrid stroked his huge index finger along the spine , the book shuddered , and opened and lay still in Hagrid's hands . 
Malfoy taunted : 
" Oh , how stupid are we ! 
We should have stroked them ! 
How can we not guess ? " 
Hagrid said hesitantly to Hermione : 
" I ... I think they're fun too ? " 
Malfoy said : 
" Oh , how horrible it is ! 
It is wise for these books to bite off our hands . " 
Harry whispered : 
" Shut up , Malfoy ! " 
Hagrid was depressed , and Harry wanted his first lesson to be a success . 
Hagrid seemed lost . 
" Well ... that's the way books and ... 
and now you need the Mystic Creature . 
Right . 
So let me take them . 
Wait a minute ... " 
He strode away from the children , walked toward the forest and disappeared . 
Malfoy says aloud : 
" God , this place is totally ruined . 
That old man taught me , I told my dad , he was crazy ... " 
Harry repeated : 
" Shut up , Malfoy . " 
" Be careful , Harry , behind you you have a bureaucrat Azkaban ... " 
" Oh ... " 
Lavender screamed , pointing to the other side of the pasture . 
The freakiest creature Harry ever saw was running lonely towards the pupils . 
These creatures have the body , tail and legs of the horse , but the forelegs , wings and head are of something like the giant eagle , with its massive steel beak , fierce , and orange eyes . flaming . 
The claws of the forelegs are one and a half centimeters long , seemingly deadly like playing . 
Each beast was wearing a thick leather necklace , connected to a long chain , and the ends of all the chains were in Hagrid's large hand . 
He was running after the beast into the pasture . 
Hagrid snatched the leashes , pushing the monsters toward the fence the students were standing on , roared : 
" Come on , come on ! " 
The children took a step back as Hagrid approached them to tie the chains to the fence . 
He waved at his students , shouting loudly : 
" This is the Code ! 
See them beautiful ? " 
Harry generally understands what Hagrid wants to say . 
After passing away from the horror of facing a half - horse and half - bird , people began to admire the shiny coat of the Bang Ma , smoothly transitioning from feather to fur , Different colors : stormy gray , bronze color , pinkish hue , shiny hazelnut and black ebony . 
Hagrid rubbed his hands together , smiling at the children around him : 
" So , the little ones come closer ... " 
No one seemed to want to follow Hagrid . 
However , Harry , Ron and Hermione carefully approached the fence . 
Said Hagrid . 
" Now , the first thing you have to know about the Code is that they are very proud , very vulnerable , do not offend them , do not pretend to play like . " 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were not upset , just chattering , and Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that they were plotting to break this lesson . 
Hagrid continued : 
" You have to wait until the Bang Bang signs first . 
Courts , understand ? 
The game steps toward a Code , bowing and waiting . 
If the equine bent , the game is allowed to touch it . 
If it does not bow , then the soul away from its sharp claws , because those claws hurt so much pain . 
Now , who wants to volunteer ? " 
To this question , almost the whole class goes back further . 
Even Harry , Ron and Hermione are suspicious . 
The Seahawks are aggressively rattling some fierce heads , strong wings gushing upward , seemingly not enjoying their choreography so much . 
Hagrid said with a pleading look : 
" No one to try ? " 
Harry said : 
" I ' ll do it . " 
Behind him , Harry took a deep breath and both Lavender and Parvati whispered : 
" Oh , no , Harry . 
Do not you remember your tea ? " 
Harry dropped off the ear , just climbing over the fence to the pasture . 
Hagrid shouted excitedly : 
" Good job , Harry ... okay ... how to deal with Buckbeak . " 
He removed one of the leashes , pulled a gray Codex out of the flock , and took off his neck . 
The students standing on the other side of the fence seemed to hold their breath . 
Malfoy's eyes narrowed fiercely . 
Hagrid whispered to Harry : 
" Now , just be comfortable . 
Look at the eyes Bang Bang , try not to blink - The Code does not trust game if the blink of an eye ... " 
Harry's eyes were instantly hot , but he kept his eyes closed . 
Buckbeak turned his big and pointed head towards Harry , and stared at him with a fierce orange eye . 
Said Hagrid . 
" That's it . 
That's right , Harry ... now , bow ... " 
Harry felt uncomfortable about bringing his neck or his back to the hindquarters of Buckbeak's beak , but he tried to do as he told Hagrid . 
He bowed quickly and looked up . 
The Mausoleum is still looking at him with a frown , not moving . 
Said Hagrid , looking worried . 
" Well , that's okay . 
Get back , Harry , just relax ... " 
At that moment , Harry was surprised to see that the Bang Bang suddenly slid his two forelegs scabbard and shrugged down to show an unmistakable bow . 
Hagrid delights in mind : 
" It's good , Harry ! 
Oh , you can touch it ! 
Go to the beak , do it ! " 
Harry felt far away from the beast , which was more of a revelation , but he still had to walk up to the equator and slowly reach for the animal . 
Harry patted the seal several times and the animal closed his eyes lazy , as if it was a pleasure . 
All the students cheered , except for Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
They are disappointed to face . 
Said Hagrid . 
" That's it , Harry . 
I suppose it would probably give her a ride on that one ! " 
This is beyond Harry's intentions . 
He used to sit on a broomstick , but he was not sure if a Seahawk was like a broomstick . 
Hagrid urged : 
" Climb up , just behind the wing , and note that you have not plucked a feather yet , that Codey does not care about that ... " 
Harry set foot on Buckbeak's wing and swung himself on the back of the animal . 
Buckbeak stood up . 
Harry does not know where to go , in front of it is only feathers . 
Hagrid gave the beast a beast , shouting : 
" Let's go ! " 
Without warning , the two - and - a - half - foot long wings of Bang Bang are spread out on either side ; Harry just grabbed Buckbeak's neck before the creature threw up so high . 
It was not like a little broomstick , and Harry knew which one he liked better ; The wings of the Bang Bang flapping its sides with an annoying wing , entangled at the bottom of its legs , making it feel like it was about to be thrown down . 
The glossy feather fell off Harry's fingers , and he did not dare to hold it too tightly . 
Instead of the smooth movements of the Nimbus 2000 familiar to Harry , now it just feels like it is wobbling , leaning back on the rear of the Equator , and bobbing up and down to beat the wings . the beast . 
Buckbeak carried it one more round around the grazing area and landed on the ground . 
This is what Harry was afraid of . 
He reached down as Buckbeak's smooth neck wished to descend , feeling like he was about to slip out of the animal , slipping through the knuckles and Buckbeak's beak . 
Then Harry felt falling down at the four unbalanced feet of the Equinox reaching the ground . 
Harry tried to correct his posture and sat upright . 
Hagrid shouted . 
" Good , Harry ! " 
Everybody cheers , except Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
Hagrid asked , 
" Star ? 
Anyone else want to go ? " 
Harry's success had left the students with more boldness , scurrying over the fence to the pasture . 
Hagrid took off the ropes for each of the Horsemen , and all around the pasture there were pupils bowing tensely . 
Neville kept running around his beast , but he did not seem to want to fall down . 
Ron and Hermione practiced with the color - coded Horseshoe . 
Harry just stood watching . 
Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle won the Buckbeak . 
The beast had bowed to Malfoy . 
This guy is pounding the beast , showing disdain . 
It stretched out loud , loud enough for Harry to hear the ear : 
" This trick is easy . 
I knew that , to Harry also do ... 
I do not have anything dangerous , right ? " It was Malfoy who told Buckbeak . " Was not it , the ugly bastard ? " 
It was as fast as the flash of steel claws . 
Just then , Malfoy uttered a wicked howl , Hagrid struggled with Buckbeak to get his necklace while he stared at Malfoy . 
He was lying on the grass , writhing his blood moths wet . 
Malfoy screamed while the class was terrified : 
" I die ! 
Look at me , I'm dying . 
That monster killed me . " 
Hagrid was white . 
He said , 
" You are not dead ! 
Does anyone help me with one hand ... take it out of here ... " 
Hermione ran to open the gate while Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily . 
As Hagrid flailed Malfoy , Harry saw a long and deep wound on Malfoy's arm ; The blood trickled down the grass as Malfoy rushed up the slope toward the castle . 
The Magical Creature Care shaking step followed . 
All the Slytherin students were shouting at each other , old Hagrid . 
Pansy Parkinson tearfully said : 
Must get him out soon ! 
Dean Thomas interrupted her : 
" It was Malfoy's fault . " 
Crabbe and Goyle stiffened their muscles . 
They all climbed up the steps to enter the Lobby . 
Pansy says : 
" Do I have to see if she's okay ? " 
They watched Pansy run up the marble stairs . 
The Slytherin students still caress Hagrid as they pull together toward their common room in the basement . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione climb up the stairs to the Gryffindor Tower . 
Asked Hermione , 
" You think it's okay ? " 
Harry said : 
" Of course it's okay , Pomfrey can patch the wounds in just a second or two . " 
Harry was miraculously healed by the nurses who wounded much worse . 
Ron also expressed concern : 
" Anyway , that happened at Hagrid's first lecture , it was all bad . 
How Malfoy stirred him up ... " 
The three of them were the first to go down to the Great Hall to have dinner , hoping to meet old Hagrid , but not where he was . 
Hermione did not bother touching the fork and donkey pie . 
She said anxiously : 
" People do not get rid of him , right ? " 
Ron also did not eat anything : 
" They should not get rid of him ... " 
Harry watched the Slytherin table . 
A large group , including Crabbe and Goyle , are huddled together , drunkenly discussing . 
Harry is certain that they are adding salt to the story of Malfoy getting seriously wounded . 
Ron said , 
" Well , I can not say today is not an interesting first day . " 
After dinner , the three returned to the common room and tried to concentrate on the homework that Professor McGonagall had given them . 
But the three of them stopped learning , glancing out the window of the tower . 
Harry suddenly said : 
" There is light in the window of Hagrid's house . " 
Ron looked at his watch : 
" If we hurry up we still have time to run down to see him , still early ... " 
Said Hermione slowly . 
" I do not know ... " 
Harry saw her glance . 
It says : 
" I was allowed to go through the school grounds . 
Sirius Black has not yet surpassed the guardians of Azkaban guarding here , right ? " 
So the three of them cleaned up their belongings , dragging each other through the hole . Mrs. Beo was happy to see no one on the way to the front door , because they were not really sure they were allowed to go out . or not . 
The grass is still wet and black in the sunset . 
Upon arriving at Hagrid's hut , the three of them knocked on the door and heard the growl inside . 
" Come in ! " 
Hagrid was sitting on the worn - out wooden table , the Fang hound holding his head on his lap . 
It was enough to know that Hagrid was drinking a lot . 
In front of him was a large tin vase close to the bucket , and it seemed to be difficult for him to gather the spirit to recognize the three little ones . 
When they realized it , he stuttered : 
" The record is not played , but to find a previous teacher who had just done the right one day . 
" 
Hermione breathed heavily : 
" You have not been fired , Hagrid ! " 
Hagrid took another sip of something in the jar , his voice sounding catastrophic : 
" Not yet ! 
But it's just a matter of time , is not it , after Malfoy had his father ? " 
" How is it then ? 
Its injury is not serious at all ? " 
Asked Ron , after the three of them sat down next to Hagrid . 
He said in a dull voice . 
" Mrs. Pomfrey did her best to cure it , but she kept saying it was still painful ... just dressing up ... and moaning ... " 
Harry said , 
" It pretends to hurt . 
Mrs. Pomfrey can heal all wounds . 
Last year , she had nearly half of her bones regenerated . 
Malfoy just deliberately eat only . " 
Hagrid's voice sounded even more tragic : 
" The school administration , of course , has heard the report . 
They claim that they start with a big animal . 
Should be left to the children in the next post ... at first should be to learn something like Hygens and such kind of ... is not your fault ... " 
Hermione enthusiastically argued : 
" Malfoy's fault , Hagrid ! " 
Harry said : 
" We are witnesses to you . 
Uncle said that Bang will attack if offended . 
Malfoy did not listen to the disaster . 
We ' ll tell Dumbledore exactly what happened . " 
Ron reinforces : 
" That's right , do not worry , Hagrid . 
We will testify to you , will support you . " 
Tears echoed from the dark eyes of his eyes and he was like Hagrid's beetle . 
He grabbed Harry and Ron , pulled them into his lap and hugged them so tight they almost broke their bones . 
Said Hermione firmly . 
" I see you drink enough . " 
She held the vial on the table , went to the door to pour . 
" Oh , maybe she's right . " 
Hagrid let go of Harry and Ron , the two staggered back , rubbing his ribs . 
Hagrid lifted himself from the chair , staggering behind Hermione . 
Harry and Ron heard the water pouring to the ground splashing . 
When Hermione came in with the empty jar , Harry asked anxiously , 
" What did he do ? " 
Hermione placed the vial on the table , replying : 
" He dipped his head in the basin . " 
As Hagrid stepped in , his wet beard was wet , his hands clawing on his face . 
When I shake my head to drain water , just like this , 
Suddenly Hagrid stood there , glaring at Harry as if he had just discovered his presence . 
He growled so loudly that the kids jumped up three inches : 
" WHAT DOES KNOWING CHILDREN UNDERSTAND ? 
HARRY , CHILD IS NOT LICENSE AGAIN . TWO HAPPY , WHY HAPPENED IT ? " 
Hagrid strode up to Harry , grabbed his arm and pulled out the door . 
He said angrily : 
" Hurry up ! 
We have to bring all of us into the castle . 
And do not let me catch you coming down to see me again when it's dark , we're not worth the risk . " 
Chapter 7 IN THE CABINET 
Malfoy did not attend school for a few days ; It was not until the fifth day , when the Slytherin and Gryffindor students were studying the same two phases of poisoning , it appeared . 
He decides to enter the dungeon as a poison class , his right arm wrapped in ice , hanging from his chest as if ( as Harry commented ) it was a heroic survivor after some terrifying battle . 
Pansy Parkinson smirked , asking : 
" Did you , Draco ? 
Is it painful ? " 
Malfoy smiled bravely . 
" Oh , it hurts . " 
But Harry noticed that when Pansy looked away , Malfoy winked at Crabbe and Goyle . 
Professor Snape cautioned : 
" Sit down , sit down ! " 
Harry and Ron looked at each other in anger . 
If they are late for class , do not listen to Snape , " Sit down . " He gave them a ban . 
But Malfoy was always free from any mistakes he made in Snape's class . 
Professor Snape , the head of the Slytherin family , is always very generous and generous to his students in front of all other students . 
Today , the children make a new drug : Concentrated Solution . 
Malfoy placed his cauldron next to the cauldron of Ron and Harry , so that all three of them prepared the ingredients on a table . 
Malfoy cried : 
" Teacher , I need someone to help you cut these roots , because my hands ... " 
Mr. Snape did not need to look up , say immediately : 
" Ron , cut the roots to help Malfoy . " 
Ron's face was red . 
He hissed at Malfoy : 
" You have no lame fingers ! " 
Malfoy sat across the table laughing in disbelief : 
" Hey , Ron , you heard Snape say that , cut the three roots off . " 
Ron took the knife , pulled Malfoy's nymph roots away , and began chopping them into mottled scissors of all sizes . 
Malfoy cried out in a plastic voice : 
" Teacher , Ron , it's chopped up on the roots of my chrysanthemum , my dear . " 
Snape's teacher approached their table , pointing his bushy nose to the roots , smiled an annoyed smile at Ron through his long black hair and shiny black hair : 
" Ron , change the roots for Malfoy . " 
" But , master . 
.. ! " 
Ron had spent fifteen minutes carefully tuning his roots for the same size . 
But in the most dangerous voice , Snape said , 
" Come on , change it . " 
Ron threw his pretty pruned roots across the table toward Malfoy . 
He grabbed the knife and continued to pry . 
Malfoy said again , his voice filled with venomous laughter : 
" And teacher , I need a person to peel Sung - round for me . " 
Mr. Snape throws Harry a hateful look that he always just reserved for it . 
" Harry , shit Sung - cross Malfoy . " 
Harry held Malfoy's Sung - ring while Ron prepared to refine the root knot he had chopped . 
Harry shucked his left Sung - twisted quickly and then tossed over to Malfoy's table without saying a word . 
Malfoy grinned happily everytime . 
Then she asked casually : 
" Have you met your old friend Hagrid ? " 
" No matter what you do . " 
Ron replied gingerly , not looking up . 
Malfoy said sourly , 
" I'm afraid he will never be a teacher again . 
My dad was not happy about my injuries ... " 
Ron growled : 
" You keep saying Malfoy , I ' ll hurt you , do not fake . " 
" My dad complained to the school board and to the Ministry of Magic . 
You know , my dad has a lot of power . 
And a long wound healed like this ... " 
He sighs loudly , 
" ... who knows if my hand is as good as the old one ? " 
Harry was so angry that his hands trembled , accidentally cutting off the head of a caterpillar's body . 
Harry said : 
" So that's the reason you set out to get Hagrid out ? " 
Malfoy lowered his voice to a whisper : 
" Oh , a part , Harry . 
But there are other benefits as well . 
Hey , Ron , cut the caterpillar for me . " 
There were some cauldrons , Neville was in trouble . 
Every now and then , Neville studied medicine . It was the worst of his studies , and the terrible fear of Snape made his situation ten times more miserable . 
Its stuff , it should have been green , turned out ... 
" Oranges ! 
See , Longbottom ? " 
Snape shouted . 
He took the ladle and poured the medicine and poured it down the cauldron , so that everyone could see . 
" Orange . 
Try to tell me , your general , his thick skull has absorbed anything ? 
Did not you hear me say , it is very clear that just a spleen of the mouse is enough ? 
I did not make it obvious that a little leech was enough ? 
What else do I have to do to make you understand Mr. Longbottom ? " 
Neville shivered like a dry - skinned man and blushed his face . 
It looks like it is going to burst into tears . 
Hermione said : 
" Sir , please ... please help me to help Neville fix it again ... " 
Cold Snape Master : 
" I do not remember telling you to show off , Miss Granger . " 
Hermione was as embarrassed as Neville . 
Snape said , 
" Longbottom , at the end of this session , we will give the toad a tasting of some drops of this drug to see what happens . 
Maybe that will promote the business properly . " 
Mr. Snape walked away , leaving Neville to hold his breath in terror . 
He groaned at Hermione : 
" Help me ! " 
" Hey , Harry ! " 
Seamus leaned over to borrow Harry's weights , asking : 
" Have you heard ? 
The Daily Prophet reported this morning ... they claimed to have traced Sirius Black . " 
Harry and Ron asked quickly : 
" Where ? " 
On the other side of the table , Malfoy listened . 
Seamus said , looking nervous : 
" Not far from here ... 
It was a Muggle that saw him . 
Of course not . 
The Muggles thought he was a common criminal , right ? 
So she called the hotline . 
When the Ministry of Magic arrived , he was gone . " 
Ron looked at Harry impliedly , repeating : 
" Not far from here ... " 
Ron turned around , catching Malfoy looking at Harry closely . 
Asked Ron : 
" What , Malfoy ? 
Need to peel what else ? " 
But Malfoy's eyes glowed brightly and kept staring at Harry . 
It leaned over the table : 
" Harry , do you count on one hand to catch Sirius Black ? " 
Harry replied without a flute : 
" Yeah , that's right . " 
Malfoy's mouth curved into a malicious smile . 
She said calmly : 
" Of course if I was , I would have done something , I would not have stayed in school like a good boy , but I would go out looking for him . " 
Ron asked rudely : 
" What are you talking about , Malfoy ? " 
Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed : 
" You do not know , Harry ? " 
" What to know ? " 
Malfoy smiles a small laugh , contemptuously : 
" Maybe you should not risk your life . 
Just give it to the Azkaban dictator , right ? 
But if it was me , I would take revenge . 
I will find him myself to pay . " 
Harry asked angrily : 
" What are you talking about ? " 
But then he said : 
" So far , you have calculated more than enough materials . 
This should be well before drinking . 
Whenever it bubbles , it will be lifted , then we will experiment with Longbottom's toad ... " 
Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly . 
They watched Neville sweat while trying to stir the craze like crazy . 
Hermione was mumbling to read instructions to Neville , her lips just curling , enough for Snape to not see . 
Harry and Ron cleaned the materials they did not use , and then washed their hands and washed the basin in the stone basin in the corner . 
Harry whispered to Ron as he reached out his hand under the cold ice - cold water from a gutter mouth : 
" What did Malfoy say ? 
Why do you want to take revenge on Black ? 
He did not do anything , at least not yet ... " 
Said Ron , fierce : 
" It made up for that . 
He is trying to get you into something stupid ... " 
Near the end of the session , Snape walked toward Neville . 
The boy cringed at his cauldron . 
Snape's black eyes sparkled . 
He called : 
" Everyone gather here and see what happens to Longbottom's toad . 
If Longbottom has managed to produce the right solution , the toad will shrink to a tadpole . 
If this is done wrongly , I do not doubt this possibility , the toad will look like it is poisoned . " 
Gryffindor pupils look at them deadly . 
And the Slytherins were happy to show their faces . 
Snape snapped up Trevor's toad with his left hand , and dabbed a small spoon of Neville's cauldron . 
Neville is now green . 
He drops a few drops down Trevor's throat . 
For a moment the Trevor swallowed a few drops of medicine , the whole room quietly . 
Then a bang burst , and Trevor's tadpole fluttered in Snape's palm . 
The Gryffindor family applauded each other . 
Snape's teacher , outraged in his pockets , pulled out a small bottle , poured a few drops on the Trevor , and the frog suddenly reappeared , fully grown . 
" Except Gryffindor five points . " 
Snape's voice echoed every smile on Gryffindor's face . 
The point deduction is : 
" Hermione , I told you not to help Longbottom but you did not listen . 
Classroom dissolved . " 
Harry , Ron and Hermione climbed up the steps to the Hall . 
Harry still thinks about what Malfoy said . 
Ron was angry at Snape . 
It lead Hermione : 
" Except Gryffindor five points because the drug was made right ! 
Why do not you lie , Hermione ? 
You should say that Neville made the drug himself 
yes ! " 
But did not listen to Hermione . 
Ron looked around : 
" Yeah , where's her friend ? " 
Harry looked around again . 
Now they were standing at the top of the step , watching the other students passing by them to the Great Hall for lunch . 
Said Ron , serious voice : 
" She's gone right behind me . " 
Malfoy passed by , Crabbe and Goyle . 
She smiles at Harry and disappears . 
Harry cried : 
" Behold , she is . " 
Hermione was hastily climbing up the steps , breathing a fraction of a second , one hand clutching her bag , the other hiding something under the front of her slacks . 
Said Ron : 
" How did you do that ? " 
Hermione joined the two of us , asking : 
" What ? " 
" Just a minute ago you were right behind us , but only a minute later you were at the bottom of the stairs . " 
Hermione seemed a bit confused : 
" What ? Well ... I have to come back for something . 
Oh , no ... " 
A tear streaks Hermione's purse . 
Harry was not surprised at all . 
It can see the bag is overloaded , with at least a dozen of thick heavy cui ịch stuffed in it . 
Asked Ron : 
" What do you have to carry around with these things ? " 
Hermione said short of breath : 
" You know how many subjects do you study ? 
Can not you handle these books for me ? " 
Ron flipped through Hermione's book and handed it over : 
" But ... you did not study these courses today . 
Anti - Dark Arts has classes this afternoon ! " 
Asked Hermione . 
" ... " 
She stuffed all the books in the same bag . 
Then she walked away , toward the Great Hall , adding : 
" I hope this lunch is delicious . 
I'm hungry to die . " 
Ron asked Harry : 
" Do not you feel Hermione is having something to refuse to tell us ? " 
* * * * 
When the children went to the Anti - Art Department to study the first lesson , Professor Lupine was not present . 
They sat down , took books and parchments , and wrote goose feathers , and then chatted until Lupine came in . 
He smiled vaguely and put his poor old school bag on the teacher's desk . 
He seemed to be as mediocre as ever , but he seemed healthier on the train , as if he had eaten a few meals . 
He said : 
" Welcome to the game . 
Please keep all books in pairs . 
Today is a practice lesson , only the wand . " 
The whole class took a book , some exchanged curiosity . 
Previously , they had never practiced Anti - Dark Arts . 
It was not to mention the memorable lesson last year , when the old teacher taught the subject to bring in a cage filled with children and then release them . 
Professor Lupine said when everyone was ready : 
" Very good . 
Invite the game follow me . " 
The students were a little confused but glad to stand up and follow Lupine out of the classroom . 
He led the children along a quiet corridor and turned a corner , where the children first saw the Peeves . 
He was flipping his head to the ground , lifting up in the sky , floating in the air , and stuffing gum into the nearest locking hole . 
When Professor Lupine approached the Peeves about two yards , the new goblin raised his head . 
It 
waving his two feet with curved toes and singing : 
" Lupine is crazy , Lupine is crazy Lupine is crazy , Lupine is crazy " 
Peeves have always been so riddled with this , and they have expressed little respect for the professors . 
Everyone looked at Professor Lupine to see how he reacted to this . 
The children were surprised to see Professor Lupine smiling . 
He said cute : 
" If I were your uncle , I would remove all the rubber that was in the keyhole . 
So , watching Filch will be hard to get into it with a broom . " 
Mr. Filch oversees the Hogwarts market , a mercenary witch , a temperamental character who fights regularly against students and , indeed , against Peeves . 
But the Peeves were not bothered by the words of Professor Lupine , except for two fingers whistling . 
The professor sighed and pulled out the wand . 
He turned his head over his shoulder to the students : 
" This is a very useful little curse , so watch carefully . " 
He raised his wand to the height of his shoulders , and read : " waddiwasi ! " , Then pointed his wand at Peeves . 
With the strength of a bullet , the gum slides out of the keyhole and sinks into the Peeves ' left nostril . 
The cat lovers flicker like a whirlwind , picking up , swearing and disappearing . 
Dean Thomas was amazed : 
" It's over , sir ! " 
Professor Lupine put away his wand and said , 
" Thanks , Dean . 
Will we continue ? " 
The teacher continued to walk , the class now watching Lupine mediocre with a respect increased significantly . 
He led the students down the second corridor and stopped , just outside the door of the teacher's office . 
Lupine opened the door and said , 
" Come in . " 
The teacher's board room is a wood - clad room filled with chairs that can not be occupied , except one . 
Professor Snape was sitting in a low chair . 
Snape's eyes glittered and his lips fluttered with ridiculous ridiculous smile . 
Professor Lupine came in , closing the door behind her . 
Professor Snape said : 
" Leave the door open , Lupine . 
I'm not interested in witnessing this very much . " 
Then Snape stood up , strode across the pupils , his black robes swell up in the foot . At the door , Professor Snape turned around on his heels , and said , 
" No one has warned you , Mr. Lupine , but this class has a game called Neville Longbottom . 
I would like to advise him not to give her any hard work , unless there is a Hermione game in his ear . " 
Neville blushed . 
Harry glared at Snape ; Neville's torture in the classroom was bad enough , now it's just in front of the other teachers . 
Professor Lupine raised his eyebrows : 
" I was expecting Neville to help me in the first stage of the operation , and I'm sure that's going to do that a lot . " 
Neville's face was reddened , unable to redden . 
Snape's lips twitched , but he walked away , closing the door to a hollow . 
The teacher beckoned the class to the back of the room : 
" Well , get started . " 
At the end of the room there was nothing except an old wardrobe where the professors kept their spare shirts . 
As Professor Lupine stepped to stand beside the closet , the cabinet suddenly wobbled , shaking the wall . 
Some pupils jump back vigilantly . 
Professor Lupine calmly said : 
" There is nothing scary . 
There is a Mr. Kẹo . " 
Most of the students felt it was scary . 
Neville looked at Lupine with only a look of horror , and Seamus looked at the knob of the locker room with a worried look . 
Professor Lupine explained : 
" The Kooks enjoy the dark places , such as the closet , the bed , the closet under the bowl sink ... 
Once upon a time I encountered a Mr. Kook living in a clock standing at his neck . 
Mr. Kẹo was moved here yesterday at noon , and I asked the principal to ask the teachers to leave it there for the third year students to practice . 
So the first question that you have to ask yourself is : What is Mr. Kook ? " 
Hermione raised her hand immediately : 
" It's a transformed ghost . 
It can hide anything it thinks makes us the most afraid . " 
Professor Lupine said : 
" That's right . 
I can not explain Hermione better yet . " 
Hermione's face lit up . 
Professor Lupine continued : 
" So when he was in the dark , he had no shape at all . 
He does not know which one will scare people outside the door . 
No one has ever known what a Kookeeper looks like when he is alone . 
But when I release it from the closet , it immediately becomes anything that every one of us is afraid of . " 
Neville exclaimed in horror , but Lupine ignored him and said , 
" This means we have a great advantage over Mr. Kuc before we start . 
Do you know what , Harry ? " 
The thought of answering to the side of a Hermione on the heel of his jaw - dropping arm was so hard , but Harry also found the answer : 
" Er ... because we have a lot of people , Mr. Koo does not know which one to hide . " 
" Exactly ! " 
Hermione's arm dropped desperately . 
Professor Lupine continued : 
" There should always be a lot of people when dealing with Mr. Kẹo . 
Ghosts will be confused . 
What should it be , a dead head or a living snake ? 
Once upon a time I saw a Mr. Petty who made that mistake : trying to scare two people at the same time and make himself a half slug . 
Not so bad . 
" Uncle Chuan to cleanse Mr. Kung simple . 
However , the strength of the will is also needed . 
You know , the real stop of a Mr. Kook is a laugh . 
What you need to do is force it to take a shape that makes the game funny . 
" We will practice the mantra first , without using the wand . 
Please tell me ... riddikulus ! " 
The class repeats : 
" Riddikulus ! " 
Professor Lupine said : 
" Very good ! 
Very good . 
But I'm afraid I just finished the easy to do . 
You should know that only one word is not effective enough . 
And this is the time to play , Neville . " 
The wardrobe shook shakily , but it was not as bad as Neville : it went forward as if it was going to the hangar . 
Professor Lupine said : 
" Okay , Neville . 
Do first things first : What do you fear most about this world ? " 
Neville's lips moved , but no one heard . 
Professor Lupine said happily : 
" Sorry , I have not heard yet . " 
Neville looked around with bewilderment , as if begging someone to help him with , and then he said , sounding like a whisper : 
" Professor Snape . " 
Almost everyone laughs . 
Even Neville smiled with repentance . 
But Professor Lupine seemed to think . 
" Professor Snape ... hmm ... 
Neville , I think you live with my grandmother , right ? " 
Neville worried : 
" Eh ... yes , but I do not want Mr. Koo to be my grandmother . " 
" No , no , I misunderstood you . " 
Professor Lupine now smiles again . 
" Do not you know I can tell people what clothes my grandma usually wears ? " 
Neville looked surprised , but replied : 
" Yes ... 
She always wears a hat , a high hat on top with a stuffed vulture . 
And a long green dress , usually ... and sometimes a fur scarf . " 
Professor Lupine suggested : 
" And a purse ? " 
Neville said : 
" A big red one . " 
Professor Lupine said : 
" OK . 
Can you imagine what these clothes are all about , Neville ? 
Can you see them in my head ? " 
" Yes . " 
Neville replied uncertainly , obviously wondering what was going on next . 
Professor Lupine further explained : 
" Neville , when Mr. Koo snuck out of the closet and saw him , he would immediately pursue Professor Snape . 
And you ' ll raise your wand , like this , and yell " Riddikulus , " and concentrate on thinking of your kinsman's hat . 
If you do well , " Professor Snape " will be wearing a hat with vultures stuffed in the top , wearing a blue dress , wearing a red suitcase . " 
Everyone laughed out loud . 
The wardrobe swayed violently . 
Professor Lupine continued : 
" If Neville succeeds , Mr. Kook can turn his attention to each one of us . 
I want all of you to take a moment to think about what you are afraid of most , and think about what you can do for the comedy ... " 
The room became silent . 
Harry thought ... 
What is the most fearful thing in the world ? 
The first thought is the Dark Lord Voldemort - a Voldemort regaining full strength . 
But before it came up with a plan that could counter Mr. Voldemort , a horrible image surfaced through his head . 
A hand crumbling , mucus , glistening , indenting inside the black coat ... a long squealing vibration from an invisible mouth ... then a cold chill bones drowning ... 
Harry shuddered , then looked around , hoping no one was paying attention . 
Many people close their eyes . 
Ron was whispering to himself : " Get him out ! " Harry made sure he understood the meaning : Ron's biggest fear was spider - biting . 
Professor Lupine asked : 
" Are you ready ? " 
Harry felt a surge of horror in him . 
How to make a demented Azkaban look less frightened ? 
But it does not want to ask for more time ; Everyone else nodded and rolled up their sleeves . 
Professor Lupine said : 
" Neville , we ' ll step back a little , letting you have a clear walk , okay ? 
The game is also back off , I will call the next person ahead ... 
Now , Neville can see more clearly ... " 
They all leaned back against the wall leaving Neville alone in the closet . 
It was pale , but it rolled up his sleeves and held the wand in his hand , ready . 
Professor Lupine raised his wand toward the fist of the cabinet door : 
" You count to three , Neville . 
One two Three ! 
Begin ! " 
A flash of light flashes from Professor Lupine's wand , and hits the fist . 
The closet opened . 
Professor Snape stepped out , his nose glazed , scared , scowling at Neville . 
Neville retreated , his wand raised , his mouth unspoken . 
Snape's teacher came up to him , pressing it against his shoulders , putting his hand inside his robes . 
Neville screamed : 
" R - riddikulus ! " 
There was a sound like a whip . 
Snape's teacher stumbled . 
Then he dressed in a lace long dress , wore a high hat on the tops of which had a gnarled vulture , and swung a large red purse . 
A burst of laughter burst ; while Mr. Ku stopped ; confused , and Professor Lupine shouted : 
" Parvati ! 
Come on ! " 
Parvati stepped forward , his face ready . 
Mr. Snape turned to her . 
Another cracking sound , where Mr. Snape just appeared a mummy wrapped in a towel full of blood . 
The mummified face of the mummy turned to Parvati and began to walk towards her , slowly , slipping on her stiff legs , and stiff hands ... 
Parvati shouted : 
" Riddikulus ! " 
A piece of ice at the mummy's feet was pouring out , tangled in the mummy's foot , causing it to fall to the front , the head rolling away the fur . 
Professor Lupine shouted : 
" Seamus ! " 
Seamus rushes past Parvati . 
Sprinkle 
Last place is the mummy now shows a long black hair woman dot the earth , blue face rubbing bone - is the goddess death . 
She opened her mouth wide , a mysterious voice filled the room , a screeching groan that made Harry's hair grow . 
Seamus screamed . 
" Riddikulus ! " 
The goddess shouted a few creaks and snapped her throat , her voice was off . 
Sprinkle 
The god of death turns into a rat , a rat who revolves around biting his tail , and then - Sprinkle ! 
- Turns to a snake ringing , writhing before crawling - Sprinkle ! 
- turned into a bloody gore . 
Lupine shouted : 
" It's embarrassing ! 
We are going to succeed ! 
Dean ! " 
Dean rushed forward . 
Sprinkle 
The eyeball turned into a rustic hand , it flipped one and started crawling on the floor like a crab . 
Dean screamed . 
" Riddikulus ! " 
Listen to a cup , so the hand is trapped in the rat . 
" Excellent ! 
Ron , next ! " 
Ron leaps forward . 
Sprinkle 
The pile of people scream . 
A giant spider covered with feathers , about two meters high , was moving toward Ron , the double click threatening . 
For a moment , Harry thought Ron had frozen . 
Then ... 
" Riddikulus ! " 
Ron roared , six spider legs disappeared . 
The spineless spider rolls round . 
Lavender screamed , running away from the spider's wheel . 
He rolled to Harry's leg and stopped . 
Harry held up the wand , but ... 
Professor Lupine shouted : 
" here it is ! " 
He rushed forward . 
Sprinkle The spider does not disappear . 
For a second , people are looking around for a moment . 
They saw a silver - spotted silver sphere hovering in the air in front of Professor Lupine . 
He said lazily : 
" Riddikulus ! " 
Sprinkle 
Mr. Kut landed on the floor as a cockroach . 
Lupine called again : 
" Neville , move on , and finish it ! " 
Sprinkle 
Professor Lupine stepped back . 
This time Neville rushed forward with a determined expression . 
" Riddikulus ! " 
Neville screamed , and in half a second , everyone saw Snape in his lace dress , and Neville burst out laughing . " Ha ha ha ... " , and his son exploded . Thousands of small smoke , then disappear . 
Professor Lupine exclaimed : 
" Excellent ! " 
The class raises again and applauds . 
Professor Lupine said : 
" Excellent ! 
Neville . Everyone is doing well . 
Let me see , five points for the Gryffindor for each student who overcame his son , Neville was ten points for doing twice ... 
Harry and Hermione are also five points each . " 
Harry said : 
" But teacher , what are you doing ? " 
Lupine said softly , 
" Game and Hermione answered my question right at the beginning of the class , Harry . 
Everyone is very good , today's lesson is excellent . 
Homework , please read the chapter on Mr. Kunk , and summarize it for me ... and submit the paper on Monday . 
That's it . " 
The kids left the room , talking excitedly . 
However , Harry did not feel very excited . 
Professor Lupine deliberately did not let him deal with Mr. Kunk . 
Why ? 
Was it because he saw Harry collapsed on the train , and thought he could not do it ? 
Do you think Harry might faint again ? 
But no one seems to care . 
Seamus shouted . 
" Do you see me as the goddess of death ? " 
Dean waved his hand around him : 
" And the girl's hand ! " 
" And Mr. Snape wears that hat ! " 
" And my mum ! " 
Only Lavender said anxiously : 
" I wonder why Professor Lupine is afraid of the crystal ball ? " 
When they returned to the classroom to retrieve their briefcase , Ron exclaimed , 
" This is the best anti - art defense ever , right ? " 
Hermione recognized : 
" You seem to be a good teacher . 
But I wish I had a chance to treat Mr. Kook ... " 
Ron snickered : 
" What are you afraid of ? 
Surely an exercise is only nine points out of ten ! " 
CHAPTER 8 CHRISTMAS FLY 
Soon , the Dark Arts Prevention class became the class that children enjoyed . 
Only Draco Malfoy and the Slytherin were still able to find a way to defame Professor Lupine . 
As Professor Lupine walked , Malfoy whispered a loud voice : 
" Look at the shape of his shirt ! 
He was dressed up like an elf at my house . " 
But no one was bothered by the worn - out or worn - out professor's shirt . 
The next lesson of the teacher is interesting as the first lesson . 
After Mr. Kuk , the children learned to the red cedar - a dwarf - like creature so terrified , lurking in bleeding places , in the dungeons of castles and holes in the battlefields . the school wasted , waiting for someone to stray in a fight for a club . 
From the red kid's to the kappa - a reptilian who lives in the water looking like scaly monkeys , a hand that has a membrane like a propeller that always strangles the strangers , strangers who accidentally crossed their ponds . live . 
Harry only wishes that his other classes would be as fun as the Dark Arts Defense class . 
But the poison class was really Harry's worst nightmare . 
This time Snape is in a state of extreme hatred , and without question , everyone knows why that is so . 
The story of his son Snape , and the manner in which Neville dressed him - in his grandmother's cloak and purse , spread like wildfire in the grasslands . 
Mr. Snape does not seem to notice that the story is funny . 
The eyes of the scumbag are threatening whenever anyone mentions Professor Lupine . 
And Snape , now 
The more aggressive Neville bullying , more than before . 
Harry was also more and more scared of school hours in the oppressive room at the top of Professor Trelawney's tower . 
In that classroom , it had to decipher distorted shapes and symbols , trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney looked at it : every time it was Trelawney's raw eyes , it was tears . 
Harry could not love Professor Trelawney , even though she was so respected by many in the class . 
Parvati and Lavender had frequent visits to Trelawney's tower at lunchtime , and always returned with a sublime face as though they knew things that no one else knew . 
They also began whispering each time talking to Harry as if Harry was lying dead . 
The mysterious Creature Care class is not really anyone's favorite . 
The next school meal after the first full - bodied event became boring . 
Hagrid seemed to have lost all confidence . 
Now he spent most of the day studying to teach the children how to care for the ones that are the most bored in the world . 
After a long hour to sit down to eat vegetables salad spleen scraping the throat of the diarrhea of ​​ the diarrhea , Ron exclaimed : 
" What is it that people have to take care of this ? " 
However , in the beginning of October , there was something else that Harry was more interested in , so interesting that Harry felt compensated for some of the less cheerful classes . 
The Quidditch season is about to end , and Gryffindor's Gryffindor captain Oliver Wood - convenes a meeting on a Thursday evening to discuss new season tactics . 
The Quidditch team is still the same , with seven players : the Three Sisters score points by throwing the large red Quaffle with the leather ball in sixteen - meter rounds at the ends of the arena ; two players use two batons to chase two black Bludger fly swinging wildly to attack the players ; A captain defends the posts , and the most difficult task is to find a goldfish with a tiny wing , half the size of a pear . 
Once captured , the Quidditch will be terminated , and any captured team will be rewarded with one hundred and fifty points . 
Oliver Wood is a strong seventeen - year - old schoolboy , currently in his seventh year , the last year at Hogwarts . 
When he talked to six other players in the cold locker room on the edge of the darkened Quidditch arena , in his voice he had a calm voice : 
" This is our last chance - my last chance - to win the Quidditch Cup . " 
As he strode forward in front of his teammates , he emphasized : 
" I will graduate at the end of this school year . 
I will not have another chance to win another cup . 
The Gryffindor has not won the trophy for seven years . 
We have all the bad luck in the world - we were injured , and the competition was canceled last year ... " 
Wood swallowed , as if remembering that still made him choke . 
" But we must also know that we are the best team ! " 
He grasped his fist in the palm of his hand , the old insult flashed in his eyes : 
" We have three super - traitors . " 
Wood points to Alicia Spinnet , Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell . 
" We also have two unsuccessful players . " 
Fred and George blush , blurting out : 
" Come on , Mr. Wood , you make us too shy . " 
Wood still exploded , glaring at Harry with a furious pride : 
" We also have a player who has never won ! " 
After a little consideration , he added : 
" And me again . " 
George says : 
" We see you are very good , Oliver . " 
Fred said , 
" Excellent captain ! " 
Wood continued to say and strode : 
" The bottom line is that the Quidditch Cup should have been our name in the past two years . 
Since Harry had joined the team , I had secured the trophy in my hands . 
But we do not get it . 
And this year is the last chance for us to put our name on the cup ... " 
Wood said so earnestly that Fred and George also seemed sympathetic . 
Fred said , 
" This year's trophy is for us , you're fine , Oliver . " 
Angelia : 
" We can do it , Oliver ! " 
Harry states : 
" Sure ! " 
So the whole team started practicing with determination , on three evenings a week . 
The weather is getting colder and wetter , darker night , but no matter how muddy or windy the rain , it can not blur the great image of the final win of the giant silver Quidditch Cup . Harry . 
One night after practicing Quidditch , Harry returned to Gryffindor's common room , cold and frostbitten , but very pleased with the performance , he suddenly noticed the air in the living room mixed Excitement eccentric unusual . 
" What's up ? " 
Harry asks Ron and Hermione , who are sitting in the two most comfortable armchairs by the fireplace and completing the star map for Astronomy . 
Ron just posted a new message on the worn - out bulletin board . 
" This weekend will be the first Hogsmeade tour . 
Late October . 
the festival of Ma . " 
Fred followed Harry's heels through the hole portraits Mrs. Beo , shouting : 
" So good ! 
I need to visit Zonko's shop here , I almost clean up all the bullets . " 
Harry threw himself down in the chair next to Ron , his spirited spirits descending . 
Hermione seemed to be able to read the thoughts in Harry's mind . 
She said : 
" Harry , I'm sure you can go next time . 
They could catch Black soon enough , they were caught once . " 
Said Ron : 
" Black is not that big of a bastard at Hogsmeade . 
Harry , you go ask Professor McGonagall to see if you can go this time , but wait until next time ... " 
Hermione earnestly : 
" Ron ! 
Harry must stay in school . " 
Ron still bends to Harry : 
" Harry could not be the only third - year student left behind . 
Go beg McGonagall , go try ... " 
Harry decides : 
" Oh , I think I should try it . " 
Hermione opened her mouth , trying to argue , but at that moment Crookshanks cussed lightly on her lap . 
In the cat's mouth was a big spider who was dying dead . 
Ron grimaced : 
" Did he have to perform that animal in front of us ? " 
Hermione said : 
" Crookshanks are so good , I caught that one myself ? " 
Crookshanks slowly chewed the spider , the cat's big yellow eyes glaring at Ron . 
Ron returned to his star map , 
" Leave it there , all talk . 
I gave the Scrabbers sleep in pairs . " 
Harry yawned . 
It really just wants to go to sleep , but it also has to finish the mapping exercise for the stars . 
Harry pulled the pair toward him , took out a roll of parchment , ink and wrote goose feathers , began to do the paper . 
Ron adorns the last star with its ornate decor and pushes its map toward Harry : 
" If you like , just go for a tiger . " 
Hermione was the one who never accepted the tiger , so she pursed her lips , though she did not say anything . 
Crookshanks was still staring at Ron without blinking , only slightly wobbly at the tip of his tail . 
Then , suddenly , suddenly . 
" Oh ! " 
Ron roared , clutching his briefcase , while Crookshanks threw all four of his claws deep in his briefcase and began tearing the pair with an aggressive aggression . 
" EXCITING , DOGS ARE DRIVING ! " 
Ron tried to tie the pair away from Crookshanks , but Crookshanks clung to him , clawing fiercely . 
Cried Hermione . 
" Ron , do not hurt it ! " 
The whole living room looked back ; Ron swung around the ring , Crookshanks clutching , the old mouse Scrabbers flying out of his mouth . 
Crookshanks let go of the pair , leaping over the table , chasing scared Scrabbers . 
Shouted Ron : 
" HAPPY CHILD ! " 
George rushed to take Crookshanks but missed ; Scrabbers wandered through two dozen pairs of hippies and sank uncontrolled old drawers . 
Crookshanks paused , bent low on the four legged legs and started furiously under his arm . 
Ron and Hermione ran together ; Hermione hugged Crookshanks hips and took them away . 
Ron stuck his belly down to the floor and struggled to get hold of the Scrabbers tail . 
It swung the wretched mouse in front of Hermione , saying with a twig of her hip : 
" Look at it ! 
It's only skin with bones ! 
She kept the cat away from it . " 
Hermione's voice shook too : 
" Crookshanks does not understand it is not right ! 
Every cat catches a rat , Ron ! " 
Ron tried to calm Scrabbers in a panic , luring him into his pocket . 
" The cat is awake too . 
He heard me say Scrabbers sleeping in his bag ! " 
Hermione can not help it : 
" Oh , nonsense . 
Crookshanks can smell the rat that Ron , how do you think ... " 
Shouted Ron , regardless of the people around him who started giggling : 
" That cat rushed in here to catch Scrabbers ! 
And Scrabbers here in front of us , it's sick again ! " 
Ron stumbled across the common room , climbed the stairs leading to the boys bedroom . 
* * * 
The next day Ron was still angry at Hermione . 
He hardly talked to Hermione during his Herbal Medicine session , although he , Harry and Hermione , did the same thing about peanut butter . 
When they put the pinky peas on the tree , peeled off the shells and dumped them in a wooden bucket , Hermione shyly asked : 
" How's Scrabbers ? " 
Ron burst into anger , so that he threw the beans out of the bucket , causing the beans to spill over the glass floor . 
" He hid under my bed , trembling like a drydrop . " 
Then the bean blossom began to burst out in front of the children , Professor Sprout shouted : 
" Be careful , Ron , be careful ! " 
After that , they learned Transformation . 
Harry intends to ask permission from Professor McGonagall for him to visit Hogsmeade with other children . 
As they darted outside the classroom , Harry tried to decide how it would explain to Professor McGonagall how it was . 
But a disturbance at the head of the row has dominated Harry's mind : 
It seems Lavender Brown is crying . 
Parvati wrapped his arms around Lavender's shoulder , explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas . 
Seamus and Dean look very serious . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione enter the group , Hermione asks nervously , 
" What is it , Lavender ? " 
Parvati whispered : 
" She has just received this morning letter . 
His bunny , Binky , was killed by a fox . " 
Hermione cried : 
" Oh , Lavender , I'm very sorry to you . " 
Lavender said in a heartbreaking voice : 
" I should have known before . 
Do you know what day is today ? " 
" Eh ... " 
" October sixteenth ! 
Remember ? 
Professor Trelawney said : ' What a scary thing will happen on the sixteenth of October ! ' 
Ancient is right ! " 
Now the whole class has gathered around Lavender . 
Seamus shook his head seriously . 
Hermione hesitated , then she said : 
" You ... have you been afraid of Binky the accused kill ? " 
Lavender looked up at Hermione with tears in her eyes : 
" Err ... unhesitatingly set that the accused killed , but its obviously very scared if it was dead , right ? " 
" Ah ! " 
Hermione exclaimed and stopped . 
Then she asked again : 
" Binky is an old rabbit ? " 
Lavender sobbed : 
" Are not ! 
It ... it's just a baby rabbit ! " 
Parvati clutched his arm around Lavender's shoulders . 
Hermione continued : 
" But then why are you afraid of dying ? " 
Parvati scowled at Hermione . 
But Hermione remained calm . 
She turned to the group and said , 
" Like this , I have to look at things in a logical way , I mean Binky did not die today , right ? 
Today was just the day Lavender received the news . " 
Lavender cried out . 
Hermione continues : 
" And obviously she did not anticipate the news , otherwise it would not have been so shocking ! " 
Said Ron loudly : 
" Lavender , do not pay any attention to Hermione , what about the other person's pet ? " 
At that moment , Professor McGonagall opened the classroom . 
Fortunately , because of Hermione and Ron 
scowling at each other . 
When they entered the classroom , they separated themselves , sitting side by side with Harry and not talking to each other during the class . 
Harry had not decided what to talk to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang , and she had the subject of visiting the village of Hogsmeade first . 
When the students were about to leave the classroom , Professor McGonagall called them back : 
" The game lingered a little ! 
Because of the fact that my students are my homeroom students , they must apply to visit Hogsmeade Village before the festival . 
No one can visit the village , do not forget it ! " 
Neville raised his hand : 
" Miss , please ... 
I ... I think I lost ... " 
Professor McGonagall said : 
" Well , Neville , my grandmother sent the application directly to me . 
It seems to me that it is safer . 
Well , that's all there is to it , out of the classroom . " 
Ron hugs Harry : 
" Please go now ! " 
Hermione opened her mouth : 
" Oh , but ... " 
Ron stubbornly : 
" Please , Harry ! " 
Harry waited for the other students to leave the classroom , and then he was thrilled to reach Professor McGonagall's desk . 
" What is it , Harry ? " 
Harry took a deep breath : 
" My aunt and uncle and stepfather ... 
I forgot to sign your permission form ... " 
The professor glanced up at Harry through the square glass , but said nothing . 
" Become ... 
Ah ... you allowed me to go to Hogsmeade , would not you ? " 
Professor McGonagall looked down at the table and pulled back papers on the table . 
She said : 
" I'm not afraid , Potter . 
You've heard me already . 
No one can visit the village . that is the law . " 
" But my aunt , your aunt ... you know , they are Muggles , they do not really know about ... the application from Hogwarts and the other stuff ... " 
With strong nods , Ron instigated Harry to continue : 
" If you say you are allowed to go ... " 
" But I did not say that . " 
Professor McGonagall stood up , arranging her papers with a drawer . 
" The application clearly states that the permission of the parent or guardian is required . " 
The professor turns to look at Harry with a strange expression . 
Is it compassion ? 
" I'm sorry , Potter , but that's my last word about it . 
You should hurry up , do not delay the next class . " 
* * * 
Can not do anything . 
Ron gave McGonagall the nickname that made Hermione uncomfortable . 
She made a face only a good thing nine good things , which made Ron mad more crazy . 
And Harry had to endure the excitement of the people in the class cheerfully about what they would do first when they came to Hogsmeade . 
Ron also said , in an effort to make Harry happy : 
" You know , there's always a party , a gala dinner on Ma's night . " 
Harry murmured , 
" SO ... great . " 
It was always great at the Ma Society dinner , but Harry was having a great party after all his friends spent the whole day in Hogsmeade . 
No one can say what makes Harry happy with the prospect of being left alone . 
Dean Thomas was a great handwriting frog , proposed to fake the signature of Uncle Dursley to sign the letter , but because Harry had told Professor McGonagall that his aunt refused to sign it , so now Now there are signatures spoof also useless . 
Ron hinted to the Cloak , but Hermione put an end to that idea , reminding what Professor Dumbledore had threatened to see through the invisibility cloak of the Azkaban dictators . 
Perhaps the most consoling words of comfort are Percy's . 
He said solemnly : 
" We were huddled up about visiting Hogsmeade Village , but I assure you , Harry , it was not like they exploded . 
It's a pretty good candy store , but Zonko's Playhouse is dangerous , and yes , the Tent is always worth a visit , but really , apart from that , there's nothing to it . Sorry to see that . " 
* * * 
On the morning of the Ma Society , Harry got up and went downstairs with all the other students to eat breakfast . 
Her heart was melancholy , though she tried her best to be normal . 
Hermione looked at Harry with a deep concern and said , 
" We ' ll bring some candy from the Duke's shop to you . " 
Said Ron : 
" Oh , hey hey . " 
In the face of Harry's great frustration , Ron and Hermione finally forgot about the Crookshanks scandal . 
Harry said in a voice that he hoped would sound natural to say out loud : 
" Do not worry about me ! 
Go play for fun . 
See you at the dinner party . " 
Harry accompanied the two of them to the Hall . There , Filch stood in the main door , checking each game based on a long list . 
Filch looked suspiciously at each other , to make sure he did not let out a game that was not going to go out . 
Malfoy was standing in the same line as Crabbe and Goyle , shouting loudly : 
" Stay up Potter ? 
Afraid to cross the Azkaban dementors ? " 
Harry left Malfoy , turned around alone , walked up the marble stairs , past the empty corridors , back to Gryffindor Tower . 
Mrs. Beo asked sleepily : 
" Password ? " 
Harry replied in a low voice : 
" Fortuna Major " ( 1 ) . 
The portrait turned aside and Harry went through the hole to enter the common room . 
In the room full of first and second - year students are chatting loudly . 
There are some upper class students who obviously have retreated to Hogsmeade so often that they are now adventurous . 
" Brother Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Hello Harry ! " 
It was Colin Creevy , a sophomore , an admirer of Harry and would never miss a chance to talk to Harry . 
" You're not going to play Hogsmeade , Harry ? 
Why not ? 
Hey ... " 
Colin eagerly looked around his friends : 
" If you like me , come and sit with us , Harry ! " 
Harry was not so excited about sitting on a pile of people staring at the scar on his forehead . 
It says : 
" Errr ... thank you , Colin . 
I ... you have to go to the library , you have some things to do . " 
After that , Harry has no choice but to return to the hole Mrs. Ba Be back out . 
As she walked away , Mrs. Beo was still harshly calling : 
" Why do you keep waking me up ? " 
Harry wandered to the library , but halfway there he suddenly changed his mind ; It does not feel very exciting at the moment . 
He turned around and touched Filch , apparently the teacher had just finished his last Hogwarts student visit to Hogsmeade . 
He asked in a suspicious voice : 
" What are you doing ? " 
Harry honestly replied : 
" No problem . " 
Filch said saliva , his jaw trembling uncomfortable : 
" Nothing ? 
It sounds like the real thing ! 
Alone around , why do not you go to Hogsmeade to buy some of the bullets or Powder Ợ sour and the Worms as well as the demons of the game ? " 
Harry shrugged . 
Master Filch : 
" go ! 
Back to the common room , where the game . " 
Filch stared at Harry until it was out of his sight . 
But Harry did not return to the common room but climbed up a staircase , thinking about going to the dugout to see Hedwig . 
He was walking along another corridor when a voice came from within a room : 
" Harry ? " 
Harry went back to see who had just called . 
He met Professor Lupine looking around the office door of his master . 
In a voice other than Filch , Professor Lupine asked , 
" What are you doing ? 
Where are Ron and Hermione ? " 
Harry replied in a low voice : 
" Yes , at Hogsmeade . " 
Professor Lupine said : 
" Well . " 
Looking at Harry for a moment , Professor Lupine said , 
" Why do not you come in here ? 
You just received a new Grindylow delivered to our next class . " 
Harry asked again : 
" What a child ? " 
He followed Lupine into his office . standing in a corner of the room is a large water tank . 
A sickly green creature with a small and sharp horn was gazing into the glass wall , distorting his eyebrows , holding his long , thin fingers . 
Lupine studied the Grindylow wistfully . 
He said : 
" Kappa . 
We will not work hard with them , they are not so bad compared to the Kappas . 
The trick to winning them is if they grab it , you twist them . 
Do you notice the unusually long fingers ? 
Strong , but also very easy to break . " 
Grindylow grinned , his green teeth shaking , and buried himself in a corner of the tank . 
Professor Lupine looked around for the kettle , asking Harry : 
" Drink a cup of tea ? 
He was about to make a teapot . " 
Harry said awkwardly : 
" Yes . " 
Lupine threw a wand into the kettle , and a stream of steam began to emerge from the tap . 
Teacher said : 
" Sit down . " 
He opened a tin box full of dust : 
" You are the only tea bag filter - but you dare say I have enough tea leaves right ? " 
Harry looked at the teacher , his eyes bright . 
Harry asked : 
" How did you know that ? " 
Lupine gave Harry a broken cup of tea . 
" Professor McGonagall told him . 
Are you worried ? " 
" Yes , no . " 
Said Harry . 
He thought for a moment whether to tell Lupine about the black dog he met on Magnolia , but decided it was not . 
He did not want Lupine to think he was a coward , especially after he seemed to have thought it was impossible for him to treat a guy . 
But something in his mind seemed to be out of sight , because Lupine asked : 
" What's wrong , Harry ? " 
Harry lied : 
" Yes , nothing . " 
He drank some tea and watched Grindylow swing his fist at him . 
Suddenly Harry placed a cup of tea on Lupine's desk , suddenly saying : 
" Well , do you remember , the meal we fought with Mr. Kook ? " 
Lupine slowly replied : 
" Mind . " 
Harry suddenly asked : 
" Why do not you let me hit him ? " 
Lupine raised his eyebrows , his tone seeming amazing : 
" You thought it was so obvious , Harry ? " 
Imagine Lupine would have denied doing so , Harry paused for a moment before answering . 
He asked again : 
" Teacher , why ? " 
Lupine showed a bit of a seriousness : 
" Well , I suppose if the ghost was in front of you , it would be in the form of the Dark Lord Voldemort . " 
Harry rolled his eyes . 
Not only because he did not expect the answer , but because Lupine gave the name Voldemort . 
The only person Harry ever heard of that name ( not to mention it ) was Professor Dumbledore . 
Lupine kept his gaze fixed on Harry , saying , 
" Obviously , he was wrong . 
But he feared that the Dark Elder Voldemort , which appeared in the teacher's room , was not very good , the students might panic . " 
Harry honestly said : 
" At first I thought of Voldemort . 
But then ... I remember the Azkaban dementors . " 
Lupine urges : 
" I understand . 
Oh , well ... I'm really touched ... " 
He smiled in surprise at the expression on Harry's face . 
" That shows what you fear the most is : fear . 
That wise , Harry . " 
Harry did not know what to say about it , he had to drink his tea . 
Lupine said again , sharp voice : 
" So you think I do not believe you have the power to treat a Kitten ? " 
" Er ... yes . " 
Harry suddenly felt a lot of joy . 
" Teacher , you know the Azkaban dictators ... " 
The knock knocked Harry out . 
Lupine said , 
" Come in . " 
The door opened and Snape entered . 
He took a cup of smoke . 
Seeing Harry , Snape stopped short , his black eyes narrowed . 
Lupine smiled : 
" Well , Snape . 
Thank you very much . 
You please put it on the table for me . " 
Snape put the cup down , Harry looked at Harry and looked at Lupine . 
Lupine pointed at the sea monster , saying , 
" I just showed Harry my Grindylow . " 
Snape said without looking at the sea monster . 
" Very interesting . 
You should drink it straight , Lupine . " 
Lupine said : 
" Okay , I ' ll drink it soon . " 
Snape said , 
" I made a full cauldron . 
If you need more , just get it . " 
" Maybe I ' ll drink a little more tomorrow . 
Thank you very much , Snape . " 
" You're welcome . " 
Said Snape , coming out of the room , not smiling , full of alertness . 
There was something in Harry's eyes that he could not love . 
Harry stared curiously at the glass , Lupine smiled : 
" Professor Snape was very kind to give me a medicine . 
He is not good at making medicines , but the drug is particularly complex . " 
He took a glass to smell , took a sip , shudder , added : 
" Sweet substance flutters just makes it useless . " 
Harry begins : 
" Why ... ? " 
Lupine looked at Harry and answered the question that had not yet been uttered : 
" This time , I feel a little down . 
This drug is the only thing that cures it . 
You are fortunate to work with Professor Snape . 
There are not many witches can make this drug . " 
Professor Lupine took another sip . 
Harry wanted to throw the glass out of Lupine . 
She blurted out : 
" Professor Snape is craving for dark arts . " 
" Really ? " 
Lupine showed little interest in it when he took another sip . 
Harry hesitated , then said in a nervous tone : 
" There are some who think ... some people think he's doing anything to get the Black Hawk Defense . " 
Lupine drank medication and frowned . 
He said : 
" Eww . 
Well , Harry , you must come back to work again . 
Later , I will see you again at the dinner party . " 
" Yes . " 
Harry placed his empty tea cup on the table . 
The empty cup is still fuming . 
* * * 
" Here , the strength of this is how much they are about to pay for you . " 
Said Ron , dropping a candlelit flush across Harry's thigh . 
At that moment , Ron and Hermione returned to the living room with a cold pink face and the excitement as if they were living the best of times . 
" Thank you . " 
Said Harry , picking up a tiny packet of Pepper Drops . 
She asked : 
" Hogsmeade ? 
Where did you go ? " 
Engage the place , listen to the information immediately - Dervish & Banges , equipment sales 
Zonko's Playhouse , Three Broom Shop to buy bubbly cups of Butter Beer and more . 
Ron and Hermione argued : 
" Post office , Harry ! 
There are about two hundred owls , each on a shelf , each with a feather code , depending on how fast you want the letter to be sent . " 
" Confucius Desserts have a new kind of candy , so they give away free samples for marketing , we bring them back to the heap , take a look ... " 
" Honestly , we thought we had met a demon eating a cannibal , at the Three Candles Shop that sells everything . " 
" Let's get you some butter , how does it make you warm ... " 
Hermione looked at Harry anxiously : 
" What did you do today ? 
Do you have any work done ? " 
" No , " said Harry , " Master Lupine mixed me a cup of tea in his office . 
Then Snape stepped in ... " 
Harry told the two of you about the cup of medicine . 
Ron's mouth fluttered open , he breathed : 
" Lupine took that medicine ? 
Are you crazy ? " 
Hermione watches now : 
" We should go down the hall , you know , the party will start in five minutes ... " 
They hurried through the portraits to enter the crowd . 
They kept talking about Snape . 
Hermione lowered her voice , glanced around with tension : 
" But if he's ... you know , if he's trying to ... lure Lupine ... he's not foolish to do in front of Harry . " 
Harry said : 
" Oh , maybe . " 
They went to the Lobby and across the Hall . 
It has been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle - lit candles , a bat - like cloud of flaming wings , and many bright orange curly bushes that float around the ceiling . The storm is like the dazzling water snakes . 
delicious food ; as Ron and Hermione had gone to almost burst out of the Duke , trying to eat every dish to two innings . 
Harry glanced up at the teacher's desk . 
Professor Lupine looks healthy and playful as usual ; He is engagingly articulating the gesture for Professor Flitwick , who teaches Charms . 
Harry moved his eyes along the table , to where Snape sat . 
Not knowing what Harry imagined , or indeed Snape's eyes watching Lupine blink in an unnatural way ? 
The party ends with a fun party hosted by the Hogwarts ghosts . 
These ghosts suddenly pop up from the walls or rise from the tables to perform a spectacular flight . 
Nick - Sut - lost - head , Gryffindor's ghost , resounding success with repertoire to cut off his head not completely . 
The evening was so fun that Harry's mood was not distracted at all when Malfoy screamed through the crowd as they left the Hall : 
" The Princes of Azkaban send that kiss to you , Potter ! " 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione followed the other Gryffindor students along the familiar corridor back to Gryffindor Tower , but as they reached the Mrs. Beo portrait at the end of the corridor , they found the students gathered . there . 
Curious Ron : 
" Why are not you all in ? " 
Harry turned his head over the heads in front of him . 
The portrait seems to be closed . 
Suddenly , Percy's voice popped through the crowd , 
" Please let me through . 
What is this pile up here ? 
All together forget the password ? 
Sorry , let me go through , I'm the South Master ... " 
Then the silence spread through the crowd , starting at the top , and a chill ran down the corridor . 
The students listened to Percy's sudden voice : 
" Somebody called Dumbledore , hurry up ! " 
Everyone turned around . 
The people in the back tried to stand on the toes . 
Ginny just arrived , whispered : 
" What's going on ? " 
Just a moment later , Professor Dumbledore arrived , moving quickly toward the portrait . 
Gryffindor students stand pressed together for Dumbledore to pass ; Harry , Ron , and Hermione were also close enough to see what was wrong . 
Hermione gripped Harry's arm tightly . 
" Oh my God ... " 
Ms . Beo disappeared from the portrait , and the painting was so brutally sliced ​​ that the scraps fell to the floor , many of the large pieces of the painting were completely torn . 
Dumbledore looked around at the ruined picture and turned around , with gloomy eyes , and saw Professor McGonagall , Professor Lupine and Professor Snape hurry to go . 
Dumbledore said : 
" We need to find her . 
Professor McGonagall , please go find Filch right away and ask him to look for Mrs. Beo in all the paintings in the castle . " 
A giggle : 
" You guys will be lucky ! " 
It is the super - goblin Peeves , who are hugging the top of the crowd , as hugely as ever before it is always before the scene of despair or anxiety . 
Dumbledore asked calmly : 
" What do you mean , Peeves ? " 
Peeves laughed a little . 
He did not dare to speak with Dumbledore . 
Instead of laughter , he changed his fluttering voice even more than a giggle : 
" Honestly , Reverend Humiliation : Mrs. Beo does not want anyone to see . 
Now we have mashed potato chips . 
I saw you running through the landscape paintings on the fourth floor , hiding in the woods , sir . 
She cried something , terrible . " 
Peeves added cheerfully , his voice was not very convincing : 
" Poor ! " 
Asked Dumbledore calmly : 
" Does she say who made this ? " 
" Oh , yes , sir professor . " 
Peeves said with a man's expression holding a bomb in his hands . 
" You understand , he was mad when Lady Don refused to let him through the door . " 
Peeves flipped the cat , glaring at Professor Dumbledore over his legs : " That Sirius Black is hot ! " 
CHAPTER 9 
LETTER BALANCE 
Professor Dumbledore gave all Gryffindor students back to the Hall . 
They were there for ten minutes , and the students of the Hufflepuffs , Ravenclaws and Slytherins were also brought in to join them , which all seemed very confused . 
When Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick closed all doors to the Hall , Professor Dumbledore told the students , " The teachers and I need to conduct a test of the castle . 
I'm afraid you have to sleep here tonight for your own safety . 
I asked the chief guard at the entrance to the Hall and I gave the responsibility to the male leaders and the female leader , and any reporters should be reported to me immediately . " 
He turned to tell Percy , who was puffing his chest proudly and solemnly : " One of the ghosts reports to me . " Professor Dumbledore stopped talking and prepared to leave the Hall , remembering : " Oh , yes , you need ... " Dumbledore just waved a wand in his hand , the long tables flew over the wall and set himself on it ; Another hallway , the hall floor immediately appeared hundreds of purple sleeping bag quietly . " Sleep well for the children . " Professor Dumbledore came out and shut the door . 
The hall immediately rumbled ; Gryffindor students are telling the whole school what has just happened . 
Percy proclaimed , " All lie in your sleeping bag . 
Come on , do not talk anymore ! 
Ten minutes will turn off the lights ! " Ron said to Harry and Hermione , " Hurry up ! " They lugged three sleeping bags , dragging them close to the corner of the room . 
Hermione whispered nervously , " Do you think Black is still in the castle ? " 
" Dumbledore obviously thinks Black may be in the castle , " said Ron . 
Still wearing a suit , they go into the sleeping bag , fighting on the elbow but continue to talk . 
" Fortunately , he chose to break in tonight , you see , the night we were not in the tower ... " Ron said , " I guess he does not know the date anymore . because they are defection . 
He can not remember tonight is the festival Ma . 
Otherwise , he ducked right here . " Hermione shivered . 
Around them , everyone asked each other the same question : " How did he get into the castle ? " A Ravenclaw student was a meter away from them , saying , " Maybe he knew how to land . . 
You know , littered and suddenly appeared somewhere . " A fifth - year Hufflepuff student said , " Maybe he disguised . " Dean Thomas said : " He can fly here . " Hermione said to Ron and Harry : " Really , I'm the only one who has read Hogwarts , a History ? " Ron said , " Maybe . 
How's that ? " Because , you know , the castle is not only protected by walls , but there are all kinds of spells on it to prevent intruders . 
People can not land naked here . 
And I want to try to figure out how to fool the Azkaban dementors . 
They carefully guarded every corner that led to the school grounds . 
If he flies in the school , then they must see it . 
Filch knows all the secret corridors . 
They will blockade ... " Percy shouted : 
" The lights are about to turn off now . 
I asked everyone to get into my sleeping bag and not talk anymore . " 
All candles turn off at the same time . 
The only light left was the pale light emanating from the silver lads floating around chatting with the heads . 
The ceiling was spell cast to look like the real sky outside , now dotted the stars . 
With that image and the whisper still murmuring in the Hall , Harry felt as though he were sleeping outside in the breeze . 
Every hour a teacher comes back into the Hall to see if everything is quiet . 
At about three in the morning , when many students were asleep , Professor Dumbledore came in . 
Harry looked around to find Percy . 
He was wading between the sleeping bags , telling the children many things to stop talking . 
Percy was only a few feet away from Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Hearing Dumbledore's footsteps approaching , the three of them went to sleep . 
Percy whispered , " Teacher , do you see any trace of him ? " " No . 
Is this all right ? "" Teacher , everything is fine . "" Good . Now you do not need to move everyone . 
He found a temporary detachment for the Gryffindor portrait . 
Tomorrow you can bring all of them back to the tower . " And Mrs. Beo , teacher ? " She was hiding in the Argyllshire map on the second floor . 
Obviously , she did not give in to Sirius Black because he had no password , so he attacked . 
She is still very upset , but when she calms down , we will ask Master Filch to restore the portrait . " 
Harry heard the door in the Great Hall open and had more footsteps . 
" Sir , " said Snape . 
Harry kept silent and listened carefully : 
" The third floor has been thoroughly searched . 
He was not there . 
Filch ransacked the basement ; There is nothing at all . " What about the Astronomy Tower ? 
Professor Trelawney's room ? 
The owl ? "" All were searched ... "" Very good , Snape . 
I really do not think he lingered in the castle . " Snape asked , " Do you have a theory about how he broke into the castle ? " Harry snapped his head slightly from his arm so that he could hear both ears . " So many hypotheses , Mr. Snape . 
And none of them . " 
Harry glanced at the teacher standing talking . 
Dumbledore turned his back on him , but he could see Percy's expression engrossed , and Snape looked angry . 
Mr. Snape said , his mouth barely opened , as if he did not want Percy to hear the story : " Do you remember our conversation last time , at ... before the semester started ? Dumbledore said , sounding in his voice , " I remember , Mr. Snape . " " It looks like ... almost impossible ... but Black himself broke into the courtroom . Castle without help from the inside . 
I have expressed my concern when the professor appointed ... "" I do not believe anyone in this castle can help Black to break into this . " 
Dumbledore's voice had a clear meaning that the subject had been terminated , and Snape did not speak . 
Dumbledore continued , " I have to go see the bureaucrats Azkaban . 
I said I would inform them after we finished checking the castle . " 
Percy asked , " Teacher , do you want to help us ? " Dumbledore asked coldly , 
" Ah , yes . 
But I'm afraid that no Azkaban jailer will ever be able to walk through the threshold of the castle when I am the principal here . " 
Percy seemed a bit confused . 
Dumbledore left the Great Hall , walking fast and quietly . 
Snape's teacher paused for a moment , looking at the principal with a deep blush on his face , and he dropped out . 
Harry glances at Ron and Hermione . 
Both of them opened their eyes unmistakably , staring into the starlight reflected from the ceiling . 
Ron asked openly : 
" What is this all about ? " 
* * * * 
Over the next few days , the whole school did not say anything other than Sirius Black . 
Theories about how he broke into the castle became even more mythical . 
A baby by the Hufflepuff family , Hannah Abbott , spent most of her time in Herbal Medicine to tell anyone who heard that Black could turn into a flower bush . 
Mrs. Beo's tattered plaque was removed from the wall and replaced by Mr. Cadogan's portrait and his grizzly gray mare . 
No one is happy about this . 
Mr. Cadogan spends half his time challenging the duelists , and half the rest of the time , he deliberately deludes the oddly complex passwords he changes at least twice a day . 
Seamus Finnigan said angrily to Percy : " He's crazy . 
Can not we find someone else ? " Percy said , " No other picture takes this job . 
Everyone is afraid of what happened to Mrs. Beo . 
Only Mr. Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer to take the job . " 
Cadogan , however , was Harry's smallest concern . 
Now it is always monitored closely . 
The teachers always find excuses to accompany it along the corridor and Percy ( Harry suspected he followed his cheeks ) then hiked to follow it everywhere as an extremely doggy guard . 
Yes , Professor McGonagall also called Harry into her office with such a grim expression that Harry thought someone had just died . 
She said in a very serious tone , " There's no need to hide it now , Potter . 
You know this will scare me , but Sirius Black ... " Harry tiredly said , " I know he's chasing me . 
I heard Ron's father talk to his cheek . 
Mr. Weasley worked for the Ministry of Magic . " Professor McGonagall seems to be bouncing back . 
She stared at Harry for a moment and said , " You understand ! 
Well , in that case , Potter , you ' ll understand why she does not let me practice Quidditch in the evenings . 
Outside of the stadium alone with some members of the team is very flawed , lack of vigilance , Potter . " Harry could not hold back his anger : " We will be the first team to play on Saturday ! 
Miss , you need to practice ! " 
Professor McGonagall watched Harry closely . 
He knew she was concerned about Gryffindor's prospects ; After all , it was she who had recommended her as a Hackman in the first place . 
He waited for her decision , holding her breath . 
" Hmm ... " 
Professor McGonagall stood up , staring at the foggy Quidditch Stadium in the rain outside the window : " Well , yes , God knows , you also want your team to finally win the cup ... But the same , Potter ... 
If there is a teacher present in the practice , she will be more secure . She asked her to look after her training sessions . " 
* * * * 
The weather was getting worse as the day before the first Quidditch match . 
Without a bit of fondness , the Gryffindor squad is still training harder than ever 
All under the supervision of Ms . Hooch . 
Then , at the last rehearsal before the game on Saturday , Oliver Wood informed the team that the news was not good at all . 
" We're not going to fight Slytherin ! " Said Wood . 
Flint just met me . 
Instead , we will play against Hufflepuff . " All the rest of the team all asked , " Why ? " Wood said , slashing his teeth : " Flint apologized that the armband of their teammate had not healed yet . 
But the real reason for doing so is obvious : do not want to play in this weather ! 
They think bad weather will ruin their chances ... " 
There was always great wind and rain during the day , and while Wood said , the whole team heard the thunder of far away . 
Harry said irritably : " Malfoy's hands are not doing anything ! 
It just pretends ! " Wood said bitterly . " You know that , but we can not prove it . 
We have practiced in the spirit and tactics against Slytherin , not Hufflpuff , the style of these two teams is quite different . Hufflepuff has a new Captain and Treasure : Cedric Diggory ... " 
Angelina , Alicia and Katie suddenly giggled . 
Facing this detachment , Wood frowned and asked , " What is it ? " Angelina said , " Is he a big , handsome guy ? " Katie added : " Strong and quiet . " Three girls giggled again . 
Fred was impatient : " He kept quiet because he was so stupid that he could not say the words together . 
Mr. Wood , I do not know why you worry so much , Hufflepuff is easy 
the most . 
Last year , during our duel with them , Harry caught Snitch in five minutes ! 
Remember ? " Wood shouted at him , his eyes bulging . " We played in completely different conditions now ! 
Diggory has held a very strong team ! 
It is an excellent skill ! 
I worry that you will suffer like this : We can not relax ! 
We must keep our goal ! 
Slytherins are trying to play the game ! 
We must win ! " Fred was a little scared : " Calm down , Oliver ! 
We will play with the Hufflepuff team seriously . 
Seriously . " 
* * * * 
On the day before the game , the wind blows to the level of howls and rain is unprecedented . 
Inside the corridors and classrooms were so dark that more torches and lanterns were needed . 
The Slytherins were all over , and Malfoy was the best . 
He sighed as a rage rumbled out the window : " Oh , that my hands are a little better ! " 
Harry has no mind what else to worry than the next battle . 
Oliver Wood rushed to meet Harry between two sessions to tell him this and that . 
The third time that this scene took place , Wood said so long that Harry suddenly realized that he was late for the Anti - Dark Arts session ten minutes . 
He ran away while Wood was still screaming behind him : " Diggory has a very drastic change of direction , so you might have to try to hook it ... " Harry winced at the classroom door . Anti - Artistic Defense , opening the door to the interior . " I'm sorry , Lupine , I'm late ... " But the man at the teacher's desk looked up not at Lupine ; it was Snape . " The lesson started ten minutes , Potter , so I figured we'd have to leave the Gryffindor ten points . 
Sit down . " 
But Harry did not budge . 
He asked , " Where is Professor Lupine ? " Snape replied with a sly smile . " He said he was too ill to teach today . 
I thought I told you to sit down ? " But Harry just stood there and said , " How sick are you ? " Snape's dark eyes flashed : " Not too dangerous . " Snape's voice sounded as if he just wanted it . " Except for the Gryffindor's five more points , and if I had to sit down again , I would deduct fifty points . " Harry walked slowly down and sat down . 
Snape looked around the classroom . " As I said before Harry interjected , Professor Lupine did not leave the trackbook that the lessons he had learned so far ... " said Hermione briskly . We have learned to deal with Mr. Koo , Red Tail , Ghost and Sea Monster , and we have just started ... " Snape said coldly : " Silence . 
I do not ask for information . 
I only comment on the lack of organization of Professor Lupine . " Dean Thomas said with a loud voice : " Lupine is the best anti - art teacher we ever had . " There was a frenzy among the other students . 
Snape's look was more threatening than ever . 
" You are too easy to be complacent . 
Lupine hardly catches the game . 
With Red Grindylow , I think the first year students have to study . 
Today we will discuss ... " Harry looked at Snape , who turned over the book , to the last chapter , which he knew would not have been learned by the students . 
He continued , " About the werewolf . " 
Hermione seemed unable to restrain herself , saying , " But Master , we have not learned the werewolf yet , we just started Hinkypunk . " In a deadly voice , Snape said , " Granger , I have the feeling that I'm teaching this class , not the game . 
And I'm telling all the games to open three hundred and ninety - four pages . " He looked around the classroom , repeating : " All games ! 
Open the book now ! " The class began to open the book in grumbling and bitter glances . 
Snape asked , " Who among you can tell me how to distinguish the werewolf from the real wolf ? " Everyone sat motionless ; Everyone , except Hermione . 
As always , her hands straight up in the air . 
But Snape did not count on Hermione . 
Smiling smile appeared on his face : " Who can say ? 
Will you tell me that Professor Lupine has never taught the fundamental differences between ... " Parvati said suddenly , " We told you , we have not learned the wolves . , we just learned ... " Snape snarled : " Silence ! okay , okay 
I never thought that there was a third - year student who could not recognize a werewolf if he accidentally met a child . 
I will record this to report to Professor Dumbledore how all the lag has been ... " said Hermione , his arm still in the air : " Teacher , the werewolf is different from the wolf . Really at many small points . 
The wolf's muzzle ... " Snape said coldly , " This is the second time you have not spoken to me , Granger . 
Except for the five Gryffindors , what we all know is unbearable . " 
Hermione blushed , lowering her hands , eyes wide with gaze on the floor . 
The whole class looked at Snape , a sign that all students hated Snape , for whoever in this class had at least one call to Hermione was the one we knew , and Ron was the one calling Hermione . We know this at least twice a week . 
" You raise a question and he knows the answer ! " Said Ron . 
What do you ask if you do not want to be answered ? " The class knew that Ron had gone too far . 
Mr. Snape slowly moved forward in front of Ron , everyone in the room held his breath . 
Snape's teacher put his face to face Ron , threatening silently , " Stop , Weasley ! 
And if we listen to the criticism of our teaching , then it will be really regrettable . " 
During the rest of the class , no one else dared to make a sound . 
The floods were all about the werewolf from the textbook , while Snape lurched up and down among the tables , examining the homework they had done with Lupine . " Bad explanation ... this is wrong , Kappa da mama is usually found more in Mongolia ... 
Professor for this post eight out of ten points ? 
I have only three points to say the same ... " Finally , when the bell rang , Snape still kept them : " Each of you wrote a text , handed it to me , about the ways it was recognized and Kill the werewolf . 
I asked for this two - roll paper , and handed it to me on Monday morning . It's time to have someone fix this class . 
Weasley stay , we need to arrange a penalty for the game . " 
Harry and Hermione and the other students came out of the classroom . 
They waited until they had gone far enough away from the new teacher to fire a fierce attack on Snape . 
Harry said to Hermione , " Snape has never behaved like this to any other Dark Arts Defense teacher , even if he wants to get away with it . 
Why did he keep pointing at Lupine ? 
Do you think all this is just in the case of Mr. Kẹ that ? " Thought Hermione thoughtfully : 
" I do not know . 
But I really hope Lupine will recover soon ... " Five minutes later Ron ran up to the two of them in a state of extreme anger . " You know the old man ... " ( He called Snape with a Something that Hermione must shout : Ron ! ) make me do it ? 
I have to wash the toilet bowls in the toilet . 
Without using magic ! " Ron took a deep breath , his hands clenched . 
" Why , Sirius Black can not hide in Snape's office ? 
He can help us pay him ! " 
* * * * 
The next morning , Harry woke up very early , so early that it was still dark . 
For a moment it was thought that the wind had awakened him , but then he felt a chill in the back of his neck , and he sat up . 
Darling Peeves are hovering beside Harry , blowing his ears open . 
Harry asked angrily , " How are you doing ? " 
The peeves blushed , then blew their strength and slammed back out of the room , chuckling . 
Harry reached for the alarm clock and took the time . 
Only four and a half hours . 
Cursing Peeves , Harry curled up in the blanket trying to find sleep again . 
But now that it's awake , it's hard not to hear the rumbling sounding on top of it , the winding sound of the window and the walls of the castle , and the sound of trees breaking down far away in the Forbidden Forest . 
A few hours later he would go to Quidditch Stadium , struggling with the hurricane . 
In the end , he gave up trying to sleep a little more , getting up , getting dressed , holding the Nimbus 2000 broomstick and stepping out of his bedroom . 
When Harry opened the door , there was something scratching in it . 
Harry bent down just in time to catch the Crookshanks tails , pulling the cat out . 
Harry said to Crookshanks suspiciously , " You soul , I think Ron is right about you . 
All around mice , take them away . scat . " 
Harry grabs Crookshanks down the stairs , adding : " Let the Scrabbers go ! " 
In the living room , the sound of the storm echoed loudly . 
Harry knew he was not expecting the fight to be canceled . 
Quidditch matches are no longer canceled due to ignorant thunderstorms . 
However , Harry was beginning to feel scared . 
Wood showed Harry Cedric the Diggory in the corridor . 
Diggory is a fifth - grader , bigger than Harry . 
Usually , the gambler must be light and nimble . 
But in this weather , the weight of the Diggory is an advantage , because it will be less likely to be hurriedly blew out of the arena . 
Harry sat in front of the fireplace to wait for dawn , occasionally standing up to stop Crookshanks creeping up the stairs leading up to the boy's bedroom . 
Finally , after sitting up all the time , Harry thought it might have come to breakfast . 
He pulled his head through the portrait hole to go out alone . 
Mr. Cadogan said , " Stand up and fight , dog scurvy ! " Harry yawned . " Well , shut up . " 
After eating a bowl of porridge , Harry eagerly awake ; And when it started to eat toast , the rest of the team also appeared . 
Wood did not eat anything , saying , " This game is going to be hard work . " Alicia tenderly said , " Do not worry , Olivia . 
We do not have a bit of rain . " 
But the weather today is a little more bothering than the rain . 
Quidditch was so fond of that that the school was still going to watch the match as usual , and they ran down the lawn toward the Quidditch Stadium , bent down to avoid the fierce wind , the parachutes knocked out of their hands . road to the arena . 
Just before Harry walked into the dressing room , he saw Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle laughing pointing at it . 
They covered a huge umbrella on the way to the stadium . 
The players of the team changed their blouses and waited for Wood's regular pre - match speech , but the craps were not uttered . 
Wood tried to open his mouth several times , sounding hard to hear , then shook his head helplessly , and then told the players to follow him . 
The wind was still so strong that they were blown away , going around the court . 
If the crowd cheered , they would not hear anything but a thunderous thunder . 
The rain smudged Harry's glasses . 
How can he see Snitch in the rain and wind like this ? 
The Hufflepuff team is coming out from the opposite side of the field , wearing a canary yellow canvas . 
The two captains moved towards each other to shake hands ; Diggory smiled at Wood , but Wood now looked as if he had locked his jaw , only nodding in response . 
Harry saw Hooch's mouth play out for hours : " Climb up the broom ! " 
Harry reminded his right leg out of the screams of a scrawl and reached for the Nimbus 2000 broom . 
Hooch put the whistle to the mouth and blow a strong whistle , whistling glistening and resounding loudly , the players soared into the air . 
Harry climbed so fast , but his Nimbus was a bit wobbly . 
He tried to hold the broom handle tightly , turning , looking through the rain . 
Within five minutes , Harry was so wet and rancid that he could not even see the little Snitch . 
Harry flew across the air , flying back and forth in the battlefield , across the dim yellow shapes , without the slightest idea of ​​ what was going on in the battle . 
He could not hear the wind comment . The crowd is covered under a sea of ​​ hoodies and tattered canvases . 
Twice when Harry nearly got hit by a Bludger ball from his broom , Harry's sight of the rain made it so dim that he did not see the Bludger fly near . 
It also has no idea of ​​ time anymore . 
It is increasingly difficult to master the grip of its god . 
The sky became darker , as if the darkness decided to fall down very early . 
Two times , he almost did not know if it was his teammates or opponents . 
Who is now so wet , and the rain is so big that Harry can not distinguish anyone with whom ... 
With a flash of lightning , Hooch squealed . 
Harry could only see the Wood ball in the heavy rain , calling it down to the ground . 
The team landed on the mud splash . 
Wood roared for the team to hear : " I would like to take a break . 
All over here , underneath ... " Both teams squeezed to the edge of the field , under a large umbrella , Harry removed the glass to wipe the gold dust off his shirt . " What's the score ? " Wood said , " We're on the top five . 
But if we do not catch Snitch soon , we ' ll have to play late . " Harry blushed at his glasses : " With these glasses you can not have a chance . " 
At that moment , Hermione appeared next to Harry's shoulder . 
She covered her overcoat over her head and could not understand her face . Harry gave Hermione a glass and , before the surprised eyes of the team , Hermione knocked her wand onto the pair of glasses and said : " Impervius " She handed the mirror to Harry , saying , " Here ! 
We ' ll wipe out the water ! " Wood looks like she wants to kiss her . 
He called Hermione hoarsely as she lost in the crowd : " Out them all , the whole team , keep on fighting ! " 
Hermione's charm is inexhaustible . 
Harry was still numb from the cold , still wetter than ever , but he was able to see . With a great deal of determination , Harry pushed his goddamn bat through the chaos of stormy weather , rolled his eyes in all directions to find the Snitch , dodging the Bludger , sliding down under the Diggory when this guy rush in the opposite direction ... 
There was another thunderclap , followed by a pitchfork lightning . 
This game is becoming more and more dangerous . 
Harry must catch Snitch ... 
Harry turned the broomstick , aiming his head toward the center of the arena , but at that moment a flash of lightning struck the stands , and Harry saw something that made it completely scatter . The shadow of a large , furry black dog , clearly visible in the sky , was motionless on the top of the empty seat . 
Harry's frosty fingers fluttered from the brush and the Nimbus wished it all down . 
Shaking his wet forehead , Harry glanced back at the stage . 
The dog has disappeared . 
Wood's angry outburst from Gryffindor's golfer : " Harry ! 
Harry ! Behind me ! " Harry looked around blankly . 
Cedric Diggory is leaping up to the court , a tiny golden ball glowing in the air between him and Harry . 
With a panicked heart , Harry pressed himself against the broomstick and dashed to the Snitch . 
The rain whipped Harry's face as he snarled at the Nimbus 2000 : " Come on ! 
Faster ! " 
But something unusual happened . 
A bizarre silence fell on the school athlete . 
The wind , seemingly stronger than ever , ceased screaming . 
As if someone just turned off the sound , as if Harry suddenly became deaf . 
What happening ? 
And then a terrible cold wave overflowed through it , penetrating inside it , as soon as it realized what was moving on the field below . 
Before he had time to think , Harry took his eyes off Snitch to look down . 
At least a hundred of Azkaban dementors are standing below , their hidden faces all pointing towards Harry . 
As if the ice water was flooding in Harry's chest , cutting his viscera into slices . 
And then he heard it again ... someone was screaming , screaming inside Harry's head ... the sound of a woman ... " Do not kill Harry ! Do not kill Harry ! 
Please do not kill Harry ! " Get out , idiot get away . " Do not kill Harry ! 
Please kill me , I beg your pardon . " 
The whitening , whirring and cold mist was filling Harry's head . 
What is it doing ? 
Why is it flying ? 
He needs to help that woman ... she is about to die ... she is about to be killed ... 
Harry fell down , drooped down through the icy fog . " Do not kill Harry ! 
Please take compassion please open compassion . " 
A snarling , screaming voice , and Harry did not know what to say . 
* * * * 
" May the ground be very quiet . " " I thought it was dead , of course . " " Well , that's not a broken eye . " 
Harry could hear voices whispering , but could not understand anything . 
It does not have a clue as to where it is , or how it got there , or what it did before it got there . 
All he knew was that every little bit of his body was aching as if it were slowly falling away . " It was the most scary sight I've ever seen in my life . " 
The most feared sight ... 
the dark shadow cover hat ... cold chirp ... scream ... 
Harry's eyes suddenly opened . 
It is in ventricular disease . 
The Gryffindor players sucking their mud from head to toe in Harry's bed . 
Ron and Hermione were there too , looking wet as if they had just left the lake 
swim . " Harry ! 
How do you feel ? " That was the sound of Fred , who seemed extremely white under the black swan . 
Harry's memory seems to be recovering quickly . 
Lightning ... 
Wait ... Snitch ... and the Azkaban ... 
Harry asked , " What happened ? " He sat up so suddenly that everyone gasped . 
Fred said , " I think you're dead . " Hermione let out a small whimper , Her eyes were bloodshot . 
Harry asked , " But there's a game . 
What happened ? 
Do we fight back ? " No one said anything . 
The terrible truth sank deep inside Harry like a stone sinking to the bottom of the pond . " We have not ... lost ? " George said : " Diggory caught Snitch . 
Immediately after I fell down . 
He did not realize what was happening . 
When he looked back and saw me lying on the ground , the photo tried to cancel the result . 
Want to play again . 
But they won honestly ... 
Even Wood has to admit . " 
Harry suddenly realized that Wood was not in the crowd . " Where's Mr. Wood ? " Fred said , " The picture is still in the bathroom . 
Looks set to drown yourself drowning always . " Harry pressed his face to his knees , his hands clenched in tangled hair . 
Fred hugged his shoulders sharply : " It's okay , Harry , I never missed a Snitch before . " Geroge said , " There must be one time I missed it ! " to speak : 
" It's not finished yet . 
We lose just one hundred points , right ? 
So if Hufflepuff lost to Ravenclaw , and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ... " George said , " Hufflepuff will lose at least two hundred points . " But if they defeat Ravenclaw ... " " No way . 
Ravenclaw is very good . 
But if Slytherin loses Hufflepuff ... "" It all depends on the score ... it's a hundred points apart ... " Harry lay there , not saying a word . 
They lost ... for the first time , since Harry joined the team , it lost a Quidditch match . 
Ten minutes later or so , Mrs. Pomfrey came to tell the team out to keep Harry calm . 
Fred said , " We ' ll see you again shortly , do not be self - pity , Harry . 
You are still the best player your team has ever had . " 
The team went out to each other , leaving behind . 
Mrs. Pomfrey closed the door behind them , her expression not pleased at all . 
Ron and Hermione approached Harry's bed . 
Hermione said shakily : " Dumbledore is mad at me . 
I have never seen you angry like that ever . 
He ran to the court when he fell , he raised his wand so he only respond as the momentum hits the ground . 
Then he turned his wand at the Azkaban dictators , shooting at them something as white as silver . 
They leave the stadium right now ... 
He was very angry that they had crossed the courtyard , we heard him say ... " Ron continued , " Dumbledore put the spell on a tape and went back to school with the tape hanging over it . Teacher . 
Everyone thought you were ... " 
Ron's voice was low , leaving him speechless , but Harry did not notice . 
He was thinking about what the Azkaban dictators had done to him ... about the screams . 
He looked up to see Ron and Hermione looking so nervous that he had to look around for a specific subject to say , " Who's got his Nimbus ? " 
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other quickly . 
" Oh ... " Harry looked away from one to another . " What ? " Hermione said hesitantly , " Yeah ... when he fell down , the Nimbus flew away . " " So ? " " And then it hit . ... it's in ... 
Oh , Harry ... it's going to be Willow Roi . " Harry's liver grazed . 
Lily Roi is a very violent , stand alone in the middle of the school grounds . " Then ? " He asked , afraid of the answer . 
" Oh , you know the Willow tree , " said Ron . " Professor Flitwick just picked up the broom before you woke up . " 
Slowly , she took a bag on her feet , pouring out a dozen wooden sticks with her baby branches on the bed . That's what the rest of Harry's loyal broomstick is finally getting knocked out . 
Chapter 10 
MAP OF THE SCALE 
Mrs. Pomfrey insisted that Harry had to rest in void until the end of the week . 
Harry did not complain or argue , but he certainly did not let Mrs. Pomfrey throw away the ruins of the Nimbus 2000 . 
He knew it was foolish , knowing he was not expecting anything else to repair or repair the Nimbus 2000 , but he still could not help but to keep the ruins ; It feels like it has just lost its best friend . 
The guests came to visit Harry , who tried to make him excited . 
Hagrid sent him a bundle of earplugs just like the yellow cabbages . 
And Ginny , blushfully embarrassed , came to visit with a card of " quick recovery " that she made herself . 
The card wafted on his waist unless Harry put it under the fruit . team 
Gryffindor returned to visit Harry on Sunday morning , this time with Wood . 
Wood told Harry in an empty voice that he had no blame for Harry . 
Ron and Hermione just leave Harry's bed at night . 
But no one who says or does anything can make Harry feel good , because they only know half what it's done . 
She did not tell anyone about Ron , even Ron and Hermione , because if they knew Ron would be scared to go crazy , Hermione would scoff . 
However , the reality is that Hung has appeared twice , and both appear to be accompanied by near - fatal accidents ; For the first time , Harry was nearly hit by a frigate ; The second time , it fell from a broom down from a height of sixteen feet . 
Is it okay to rewrite it until it really dies ? 
Does it live for the rest of my life in the immediate pain of the beast ? 
And also the Azkaban dementors . 
Every time they think of them , Harry is embarrassed and wants to be sick . 
Everyone says the Azkaban dementors are horrible , but no one dives when they come near a jailer ... no one hears the sound of their parents dying . 
Because now Harry knows the screams he hears in his head . 
He listened to these words , the words of the woman , during the nights it was in void , watching the moon shine on the ceiling . 
When the Azkaban dashes approach Harry , he hears the final moments of his cheeks , her efforts to protect him , Harry , from the hands of the Dark Lord Voldemort , and the grin of the Dark Knight . Voldemort before killing her ... 
Harry fell asleep drowsy , drowning in dreams filled with rotten hands sticky and prostrate , so that the wake up and again with the shrieking shrieks of mother . 
* * * 
By the second day , Harry had calmed down his sadness in his heart when he returned to the hustle and bustle of the school , which made his head think of other things , even with the sarcasm of Malfoy . 
Gryffindor's defeat makes Malfoy delighted . 
It removes the bandage , celebrating the use of both hands by vividly copying Harry's bump . 
Malfoy spends most of his next drug school mimicking the Azkaban dashes passing through the basement ; Finally , overwhelmed , Ron threw a crooked crocodile heart into Malfoy , hit in the middle of his face , causing Professor Snape to lose fifty points from the Gryffindor . 
When he went to the Anti - Art Prevention class after lunch , Ron said , 
" If Snape teaches the Dark Arts Prevention class again , I will be sick . " 
Hermione , you see who's in ? 
Hermione went to the classroom door , looking at : 
- - It's good now ! 
Professor Lupine returned to the podium . 
Seeing that Lupine was seriously ill . 
His old robes were obviously wider , loosened on his body , and under his eyes were dark circles . 
However , he still smiled to the class when the classless students sat down . 
They immediately flush out a clue about how Snape treated Mr. Lupine's illness . 
- Not fair at all , just teach it temporarily , why did Snape teacher arrested us to do the homework for him ? 
" We do not know anything about the werewolf ? " 
- To two rolls of paper ! 
Lupine bitterly asked , 
- Did you tell Snape that you did not study that chapter ? 
Battle of the flush up again : 
" Yes , but Snape says we are lagging behind . " 
- - he did not listen ... 
- - ... 
those two rolls of parchment ! 
Professor Lupine smiled at the anger on the faces of the students . 
- Do not worry too much . 
You will talk to Professor Snape . 
You must not write a thesis . 
- - Oh ! 
Out ? 
The disappointment was that of Hermione . 
She said : 
- But you finished it ! 
That day they had an interesting lesson . 
Professor Lupine carries a Hinkypunk tub , a tiny creature with a leg that looks like it's made of smoke , not just fragile and harmless . 
Professor Lupine explained while the students hastily recorded : 
- That seduce traveler in the swamp . 
Have you noticed the lantern swaying in his hand ? 
It jumps - people follow the light - and then ... 
Hinkypunk squealed a screeching sound into the sink in response to Lupine . 
When the bell rings , everyone gathers their belongings and pulls out to the door , so does Harry , chewing among his friends , but Professor Lupine calls : 
- Wait a minute , Harry , I have something to tell you . 
Harry turned and looked at the professor with a cloth covering the Hinkypunk tub . 
Finished , he returned to the desk , began to book the book in his briefcase : 
- Did you hear about the game and regretted my god broom ? 
Can it be repaired ? 
Harry replied , 
- Yes , no . Willow Roi beat it into pieces . 
Lupine sighed : 
- The Root was planted the right year when he came to this Hogwarts school . 
At that time students often play under the trees , even try to touch the body itself . 
But after all , when a boy named Davey Gudgeon , nearly blindfolded with a tree , was banned from approaching the tree . 
The lighter shade is no more light than the bag . 
Harry hard to open the words : 
- Teacher , have you heard of the Azkaban dictators ? 
Lupine quickly looked at Harry . 
- Yes , you have heard . 
I believe that none of us have ever seen Dumbledore get angry . Sometimes the Azkaban diarrhea is impatient ... they get angry at being denied entrance to the stadium ... 
Do you think they are the cause of your fall ? 
- Yes . 
Said Harry . 
He hesitated , then the question he had to ask naturally came out of his mouth before he could control himself . 
- Teacher , why so ? 
Why can they affect such a child ? 
Are you ... 
Lupine immediately said , as if he could read the mind in Harry's mind : 
- That has nothing to do with weakness . 
The Azkaban douchers affect the worse for others because of the horrors of the past that others do not have . 
A light of winter sun through the classroom , illuminated the salt hair on Lupine's head and the still young lines on his face . 
" - Dementia Azkaban belongs to the most abominable creatures in the world . 
They flood into the darkest , darkest places , they honor rottenness and despair , they drain the peace , hope and happiness in the air around . 
Even Muggles feel their presence , even though they can not see them . 
Anyone who is too close to the Azkaban dictators , all good emotions , happy memories will be drained from that person . 
If possible , the Azkaban dictators will pacify the person until they capture it and turn it into a fantasy like them - lifeless and evil . 
In the heart of the person will be nothing but the worst experience in life . 
And Harry was , the worst thing that ever happened to me haunted me so I fell out of the broom . 
I do not have to be ashamed of it ... 
Harry stared at Professor Lupine's desk , his throat hardening : 
- When they came near you ... I heard Voldemort kill her mother . 
Lupine made a sudden gesture as if he wanted to hold Harry , clutching his shoulders , but thought not . The teachers quiet for a moment , then Harry bitter said : 
- They are becoming hungry . 
Dumbledore did not let them go to school , so their supply of human victims was getting depleted . 
He said they could not resist the pull of a large crowd gathered at Quidditch Stadium . 
All the excitement ... 
Those high - pitched emotions ... are the idea of ​​ a party for them . 
Harry murmured : 
- The Azkaban jail would be terrible . 
Lupine nodded . 
- The fort was built on a small island off the coast , but they did not need a high wall or deep water to hold prisoners . 
No , once the prisoners are trapped inside their minds , they can no longer think of a cheerful idea . 
Within a few weeks , most of these prisoners were crazy . 
Harry said slowly , 
- But Sirius Black escaped them . 
He has defected ... 
Lupine's bag slipped off the desk , and he hastily bent down to capture it . 
He said as he stood up straight : 
" Oh , sure Black has found some way to support the Azkaban dementors . 
You can not believe it can ... 
The bureaucrats of Azkaban , however , have depleted the power of a witch once they have been in close proximity . 
Suddenly , Harry asked , 
- He himself forced the banger Azkaban on the train must be backward , is not he ? 
Professor Lupine said : 
- There are ... self - defense that people can use . 
But there was only one dad on the train . 
The more crowded they are , the harder it is to drive them away . 
Harry asked immediately : 
- How to defend yourself , teacher ? 
- I do not want to pretend to be a dictator , Harry ... in reverse ... 
" But if the guards go to another Quidditch match , they need to be able to stand up to them . " 
Lupine looked at Harry's determined expression , hesitated for a moment , then said , 
- - Okay . 
You will try to help me . 
But I'm afraid to wait for the next semester . 
You have to do before the holiday . 
It was the most awkward moment that I fell sick again . 
Harry's spirits are enhanced by Lupine's promise to teach him how to defend the Azkaban dementors , which he believes will no longer have to hear his mother's death again ; On the other hand , the spirit of it is even more awe thanks to the Quidditch match at the end of November : Ravenclaw squad crushed Hufflepuff . 
So the Gryffindor did not lose hope , although their situation now is not able to lose a match anymore . 
Wood regained his frenzy of energy and made the Gryffindor squad training to the dismay as it had been in the long , cold rain that lasted until December . 
Harry saw no sign of the dementors Azkaban in the schoolyard anymore . 
Dumbledore's anger seemed to have sent them back to their guard at the school entrance . 
Two weeks before the end of the semester , the sky suddenly lights up in a milky white color , and a muddy muddy courtyard emerges with a frosty frost cover . 
Inside the castle , the atmosphere of Christmas is quite bustling . 
Professor Flitwick , the teacher of charms , finished decorating his class with flickering light bulbs that could turn out to be the true fairies . 
All the students are cheerfully discussing their holiday plans . 
Both Ron and Hermione decided to stay at Hogwarts , and although Ron said he decided to stay at his school 
It was impossible for him to endure for two weeks , and to go to the research school library ; But it was hard to fool Harry , he knew that the two of them stayed at the school to have a friend , so Harry was touched and grateful . 
On the weekends of the final week of the semester , everyone was happy , except for Harry , because of a trip to the village of Hogsmeade . 
Hermione : 
- We can buy all the Christmas presents there ! 
Our cheeks will be very fond of some candy floss mint of the Duke's shop ! 
Due to the fact that it was the only student of the third year to stay in school once again when everyone was going to Hogsmeade play , Harry borrowed from Wood a book entitled Choose the Spirit , decided to devote day to read all about the difference between the brand of broom god . 
In rehearsals with teammates today , Harry used the school's broomstick , an ancient Spider - Man , just as slow as he liked tomatoes . 
Harry , of course , needed a new god broom for himself . 
On the morning of Saturday visiting Hogsmeade , Ron and Hermione farewell to Harry , wrapped in his cloak and wrapped around his neck . 
Harry returned by himself to climb the marble stairs , heading back to Gryffindor Tower . 
The snow began to fall outside the window , and the castle was quiet and quiet . 
- Harry ! 
Shit ! 
walking through the half - corridor on the third floor , Harry heard the cry , turned around , saw Fred and George poking his head out from behind the witch's eye with a hunched - over eye . 
Curious curiosity : 
- What are you doing here ? 
Do not you visit Hogsmeade Village ? 
Fred said with a mysterious wink : 
" We came here to give you a few minutes before we left . 
Come in ... 
Fred nodded to Harry for an empty study room on the left side of the one - eyed statue . 
Harry follows Fred and George inside . 
George closed the door gently and turned to look at Harry with a beaming smile . 
It says : 
- An early Christmas present for you , Harry ! 
Fred pulled out something from under his cloak with a very colorful expression . 
He put that on the table . It's just a big , square and crumpled parchment , and there's not a word in it . 
Harry looked suspiciously at the parchment , wary of what Fred and George were playing . 
- What is that ? 
George patted the parchment gently : 
- Harry , this is the secret of our success here . 
Fred said , 
- Give me , we also have a gut . 
But we decided last night that you need it more than us . 
George added : 
- With each other , we already belong to him heart . 
Now we send it back to you . 
We do not need it anymore . 
Harry wondered : 
" But what do you need an old piece of parchment for ? " 
- An old piece of parchment ! 
Fred blurted out , closing his eyes with a pained expression as if Harry had insulted him terribly . 
It says : 
- George , explain it ! 
- Ờ ... 
When we were five years old , Harry - also young , carefree , naive ... 
Harry chuckled . 
He suspected Fred and George had never been naïve in life . 
- Italy is more innocent now - We were in trouble with Filch . 
- - ... 
We bombed a bomb in the corridor and for some reason this made him very angry ... 
- So he took them both to his office and threatened us with his usual fingers like ... 
- - ... detention ... 
- - ... abdominal surgery ... 
- ... and we could not help but notice the drawer of one of his lockers marked Foreclosed and Very dangerous . 
Harry began to grin : 
- Do not tell me ... 
Fred said , 
- Oh , what do you do ? 
George distracted Filch by dropping another bomb , and he snatched the drawer and caught it . 
George says : 
" You know , that's not bad . " 
We guess that Filch can not find out how to use this . 
However , he probably suspects it to be something useful , but if not , he will confiscate again . 
- And you know how to use it ? 
Fred smiled shyly : 
- Oh , you know . 
This pretty little thing taught us more than all the teachers in this school . 
Harry looked at the worn - out old parchment , saying : 
- You make me nervous . 
George cried : 
- Oh , so what ? 
He withdrew the wand , touched the parchment and read the mantra : 
- I solemnly vowed that I was worthless . 
Immediately the lines in ink began to appear and gradually spread like a spider web from the point where George touched his wand . 
These lines connect together , cut each other , and spread out like a fan at each corner of the parchment ; and then the words began to blossom like flowers across the parchment ; The big green letters say that : 
Mr. Mui Ngon Ngon , Wormtail tail , Bong Feet and Gau Nai The company provides equipment for the wreckers magic Honored to present 
MAP OF THE SCALE 
It was a map showing every corner of Hogwarts Castle and the surrounding courtyard . 
But what really counts is the tiny dots that move around in the map , each dot carrying a name tag written in lei . 
Amazingly , Harry looked down at the dots . 
A dot in the top left corner shows Dumbledore walking in the Principal's room ; Another dot shows that Mrs Filis's cat , Norris , is snooping on the second floor , and in the media room , her lover is peeing over . 
And when Harry looked up and down the familiar corridors , he realized one thing : 
This map exposes a system of paths that it has never set foot . 
Which many corridors it seems to lead ... 
- Straight to Hogsmeade . 
Fred fingered one of those paths , saying : 
- There are seven paths , now Filch knows four ways . 
He pointed to the secret passages discovered by Filch , saying , 
" But these paths are certainly only known to us . Do not waste your time in the back of the mirror on the fourth floor . 
We used to last until last winter alone , the hangman , then completely secret . 
As for this path , we were sure no one had ever used it , because the Willow Tree stood in the doorway . 
But this passage , this way leads directly to the storehouse of secretary Duke . 
We used this way a billion times already . 
And perhaps you should also notice , the door to this passage is on the right side of this room , through the witch statue of one eye . 
George stroked the words at the top of the map , sighing : 
- Dream , Silk , Wormtail , Stuffed Feet and Gau Nai . 
We owe them a lot . 
Fred solemnly said : 
- Noble people , working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers . 
George quickly replied : 
- - it's correct . 
When to use it , then remember to clean it . 
- If not then anyone can see it ! 
Fred said warily . 
- Just leave it one more and read the mantra " The law is complete ! " , The map is empty as the original . 
Fred dictated Percy's solemn tone , saying : 
" So , Harry , this kid , do it ! 
George winked : 
- See you at Duke's shop ! 
Both Fred and George walked out of the classroom , laughing in a very satisfying manner . 
Harry still stood there , bleeding in excitement , Harry still heard from the inside of the words Mr. Weasley once said : 
- Never believe anything you can think for yourself if you can not see where your brain is . 
This map is one of the dangerous magical items that Mr. Weasley warned to watch ... 
Help the equipment for the magic wreckers ... 
But then Harry argues that he only wants to use the map to go to Hogsmeade , but does not steal or attack anyone ... with Fred and George used to spend it years Then what terrible thing happened . 
Harry traced his way to the secret chamber of the Duke's shop . 
Then , suddenly as if obeying a command , Harry rolled the map , stuffed it in the robes he was wearing , hurried to the classroom door . 
He opened the door a few inches . 
No one outside . 
He sneaked out of the room with great care , then spat out behind the statue of a witch . 
What to do ? 
Harry pulls out the map and is surprised to find a new dot labeled " Harry Potter " on the map . 
The dot was in place to peel off the spot where Harry was standing , in the middle of the corridor on the third floor . 
Harry carefully observed . 
Its tiny ink seems to tap on the witch's tiny wand . 
Harry quickly pulled out his wand and knocked on the statue . 
Nothing happened . 
He looked at the map again . 
In which the mantra appears : 
- Dissendium ! ( Open the way ! ) 
Harry knocked on the stone again and whispered : 
- Dissendium ! ( Open the way ! ) 
Immediately the hump on the back of the statue opened , wide enough for a sick enough to enter . 
Harry glanced briefly at the top of the corridor , then tucked the map back in his shirt , swung himself onto the statue , tucked his head in the hole on his hunchback , and then crawled inside . 
It slides down a long distance , apparently on a stone slide , landing on a damp , cold ground . 
Harry stood up , looking around . 
Like a button . 
He raised his wand , whispering : 
- Lumos ! 
He found himself in a narrow and low earth walk . 
He pulled out the map again , knocked his wand on the map , mumbled to read : 
- The law is complete ! 
Instant maps are empty . 
Harry folded the map carefully , hiding it in his robes , then with his heart fluttering in his chest , both nervous and nervous , he started walking . 
The path is crooked , like the cave of a large rabbit , the largest . 
Harry hurried away , occasionally stumbling on the dirt floor , still holding the wand clenched to the front . The road goes on for a long time , but thinking of the Secret Duke , Harry is eagerly stooping . 
After a flashback of an hour , the path began to climb . 
His heart pounded , Harry stepped up quickly , his face hot and his legs cold . 
Ten minutes later , Harry walked to the foot of the worn stone steps , rising high up , losing his upper head . 
Be careful not to make a noise , Harry started climbing . 
One hundred steps , two hundred steps , it all counts when climbing just look at the foot ... 
Then suddenly his head touched something hard . 
It looks like it's a trapdoor . 
Harry stood , rubbing his head , listening . 
But it can not hear a sound on the top . 
He opened the door , slowly , slowly , and looked through the crevice . 
It was in a vault filled with crates and wooden crates . 
Harry climbed over the shutter , then collapsed - the door immediately faded into the dust so perfectly that it was impossible to say there was a door . 
Harry crawled slowly towards the wooden stairs leading upstairs . 
Now it is certain to hear the sound , including the tinkling sound and the door closing . 
wondering what he should do , Harry suddenly heard a door open , almost close to his . 
Someone is about to go down the stairs . 
And the voice of a woman : 
- Take another basket of sweet potatoes , dear , the little ones are nearing the end of this dish . 
One foot steps down the stairs . 
Harry jumped out of a large wooden crate , waiting for the footsteps to pass . 
He heard the man move the boxes near the opposite wall . 
Can not miss this chance ... 
Suddenly and quietly , Harry sneaked out of the hiding place , climbing up the stairs . 
Looking back , he also saw the large back and a bald head is buried in a box . 
Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs , crossed over , and found himself standing behind the counter of the Duke's shop . 
He dropped his head , crawled around , and straightened up . 
The Duke of Hogwarts School supplies so much that no one is watching Harry twice . 
He squeezed among the kids , looked around , trying to hold back his laughter as he imagined the look on Dudley's face like a pig , just to see that Harry was here , at this moment in the row of rows of rows of shelves . Filled with candy looks delicious to crave . 
Candied chocolate filled with ice cream , candy - sized square - shaped pie , hard chocolate colored candy , and hundreds of different kinds of chocolates , a bowl filled with full - bodied marshmallows , and another large barrel of Beef Sauce , a kind of inflatable balloon that Ron had mentioned . 
Along the other wall is the candy " Special Effect " such as : Blowing gum ( these candies make the room full of blue bubbles that do not burst for several days ) ; Candy Floss Mint Mint , Pepper Pepper ( breathe fire for you ! ) , Ice Mouse ( hear your teeth scorpion and whistle ! ) , Mint ice cream shaped like toads ( really swirling in the stomach ! ) , goose woolen pens made of sugar and candies burst . 
Harry squeezed through a crowd of sixth - graders and saw at the far end of the shop hanging a table : " Unusual Taste . " 
Ron and Hermione stood under the sign , scrutinizing a tray full of bloody candy sticks . 
Harry sneaks behind his two friends . 
Hermione said : 
" Gosh , do not buy , Harry does not bother with any of this stuff , I just parked something for vampires . 
Ron gulped a hive of bears under Hermione's nose : 
- What about this ? 
- Absolutely not ! 
Hearing Harry's voice , Ron nearly dropped the candy cane . 
Hermione squealed : 
- Harry ! 
What do you do here ? 
How ... 
How are you ... ? 
Ron was very moved : 
- - Gosh ! 
How are you able to go to school ? 
Harry said : 
- - Of course not . 
He lowered his voice so that no one among the sixth graders gathered over there listening to the story . 
Harry told the two of them about the map of the robber . 
Ron furiously : 
- How did Fred and George ever give you that map ? 
I'm the brother of two photos ! 
Hermione said as if the idea was ridiculous : 
- But Harry will not keep the map , but will bring it back to Professor McGonagall , is not Harry ? 
Harry said : 
- No , I will not pay ! 
Ron rolled her eyes and looked at Hermione : 
- Are you crazy ? 
Something like that ? 
- If I bring it , I ' ll have to explain where I got it ! 
And Filch will know that Fred and George have stolen it ! 
Hermione hissed . 
- But what about Sirius Black ? 
He can follow one of the secret passages into the castle ! 
My teachers must know this ! 
Harry said quickly : 
- He can not break into the castle with a secret passage ! 
There are seven secret paths on the map , right ? 
Fred and George said Filch had learned four , and the other three had been blocked , so no one was able to pass through , one was caught by Willow at the exit . So no one can escape , and the path that I just passed ... 
It was very difficult to detect the entrance at the bottom of the storeroom ... unless he knew the exact door here ... 
Harry hesitated . 
Oh , if Sirius Black knew the secret way to break into the castle ? 
However Ron cleared his throat loudly and pointed out the message inside the door of the candy store : 
IN ORDER BY THE MINISTRY OF LAW 
Customers are reminded that , until the new announcement , the Azkaban dictators will march in the streets of the village of Hogsmeade every evening after sunset . 
This measure is set for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will be abolished upon capture of Sirius Black . 
It is therefore recommended that you complete the shopping before dark . 
Wish you happy Christmas . 
Said Ron , 
- - See it ? I want to see how Sirius Black can dare go to the Duke shop while the dementors Azkaban are going around the village . 
With the , 
Hermione , the owner of the Secret Dictator must know if there is an intrusion ? 
They live in the shop ! 
Hermione seems to be trying to find another problem : 
" Oh , but ... but ... you think , Harry should not go to Hogsmeade , he does not have a license ! " 
If anyone finds out , he just takes on more trouble . 
Is not it dark now , if Sirius Black suddenly appear today ? 
Or right now ? 
- He will have to struggle with Harry in this weather ! 
Said Ron , nodding toward the window bars : the snow outside was falling thick and swirling in the wind . 
" Come on , Hermione , Christmas is near , Harry deserves a lot of sleep ! " 
Hermione bit her lip , looking extremely anxious . 
Harry grinned , telling her : 
- Do you have something to talk about ? 
- Oh ... of course not ... 
But Harry ... 
Ron grabbed Harry and dragged him toward the boxes of kitten sisters : 
- Do not you think , Harry ? 
With some snakes again ? 
And a cup of cold drinks ? 
When I was seven years old , Fred gave me one of these - it made his tongue burn a hole . 
At that time , cheeks were shot with the god of the cheeks , I still remember . 
Ron looked at the Asterisk box with a resentment . 
- Did you think that Fred would have a little bit of Cockroaches if I cut the picture was peanut ? 
When Ron and Hermione had paid for the candy they had bought , the three of them left the Duke's shop to run outside in the blizzard . 
Hogsmeade looks exactly like the Christmas card : the roofs and shops are covered in a thick layer of snow ; On the doors hung the sacred wreaths and scattered around the dome of the trees are the magic candles . 
Harry shivered , he did not have a shirt like two friends . 
They went out to the road , their heads bowed to avoid the wind , Ron and Hermione shouted through the scarf : 
- Kia is a post office ... 
- Zonko's Supermarket is over there . 
- We can go to the tent ... 
Ron's teeth scuffed : 
- Or this , we go to beer at the Three Broom Shop ? 
Harry did not expect much . 
The wind was fierce and his hands were numb . 
So the three of us crossed the street and just a few minutes later we walked into a tiny restaurant . 
This shop is extremely crowded , warm , noisy , and full of smoke . 
The owner of the restaurant has a waist and a beautiful face serving a meal for a bunch of noisy French teachers in the bar . 
" It's Rosmerta , " said Ron . 
Let's go buy a drink ? " 
When I say the following , Ron's face is a little red . 
Harry and Hermione wandered to the far end , where there was a small empty table , placed by the window , next to a beautiful Christmas tree standing by the fireplace . 
Five minutes later , Ron returned , holding three cups of hot buttered beer still bubbling . 
Ron raised his glass of champagne , saying happily , 
- Happy Christmas ! 
Harry took a deep breath . It was the most delicious thing that it had ever tasted , and the butter that seemed to heat up every bone of his flesh . 
A breath of air ran through Harry's hair . 
The triple door opened , Harry looked over the edge of the glass he held in his hand and choked on his throat . 
Professor McGonangall and Professor Flitwick walked in with a snowstorm . 
Behind those two , Hagrid was busy talking to a fat man with a lemon - covered blue hat and striped shirt : Cornelius Fudge ! 
Immediately , both Ron and Hermione put their hands on Harry's head and pressed it down the counter , hiding under the table . 
Noticing the buttered butter on the edge of the bar , Harry hugged his empty glass in his hands , peering at the pair of teachers and Mr. Fudge toward the bar , stopped , and turned back . , head towards it . 
Somewhere above , Hermione whispered : 
- Mobiliarbus ! ( Move , the chain over here ! ) 
The Christmas tree next to it lifted its feet from the ground a few inches , crossed to one side and landed on the ground in front of their table , covering all three . 
Looking through the low branches , Harry saw four pairs go to the next table , then grumbled and the sighs of the teachers and the Minister of Magic when they sit down . 
Next , Harry saw another pair of turtled heels with sparkling heels and heard a woman say , 
- A little Gilly spring water ... 
- - Mine . 
Professor McGonagall . 
- Four honey wine warming up here ... 
Said Hagrid . 
- Thank you , Rosmerta . 
- A syringe of cherry syrup with sodas and ice ... 
Professor Flitwick licked his lips : 
- Mm ! 
- And Minister , a glass of water mixed with water , right ? 
Fudge's voice : 
- Thank you Rosmerta Dear . 
You have to say I see you so cute . 
Do you also make a glass ? 
come join us with us ... 
- Yes , thank you , Minister . 
Harry watched the high heels turn and went back . 
Her heart throbs irritably . 
Why did not he think it was the last weekend for the whole school semester ? 
Do not know how long they sit there ? 
It takes time to sneak back into the Duke , if he wants to return to Hogwarts School tonight . 
Hermione's leg was creaking nervously . 
Rosmerta's voice resounded : 
- So , please ask the Minister , so the wind that brought him to the monkey cough flamingo this place ? 
Harry saw Fudge's fumbling arrow turn as if he were checking to see if anyone was eavesdropping . Then he said in a low voice : 
" What else besides Sirius Black , my dear ? " 
I bet you heard that happened at Hogwarts School on Ma Association night ? 
Ms Rosmerta acknowledged : 
- I have heard rumors . 
Professor McGonagall said irritably : 
- You bring the story to the pub , Mr. Hagrid ? 
Rosmerta whispered : 
- Mr. Minister , do you suppose Black is still hovering in this area ? 
Mr. Fudge stated briefly : 
- - I'm sure about that . 
Mrs. Rosmerta said , listening to her voice a little bit : 
- Do you know how many Azkaban dictators have controlled your restaurant twice ? 
Hurry your customers to leave ... 
That's bad for business , Minister . 
Mr. Fudge said miserably : 
" Dear Rosmerta , I do not like them any more than you . 
But that is the necessary defense that ... 
Disappear , but then you do not have any right ? ... 
You just met some of them . 
They were so upset Dumbledore - You were not going to let them inside the school yard . 
Professor McGonagall said coldly : 
- I do not think so . 
How can we lecture while the vicious threats go round and round ? 
Professor Flitwick was squatting in his chair , his legs fluttering out of the ground . 
Professor shrieked . 
- - agree ! agree ! 
Mr. Fudge objected : 
- That's it . 
They are here to protect you all from even worse things ... 
We all know what Black can do ... 
Mrs. Rosmerta said with great anxiety : 
- You know , I still have difficulty believing it . 
Of all the Black people , Sirius Black was the one I did not expect ... I mean , I still remember him as a student at Hogwarts . 
If at that time he told me that the student and then become a murderer , I will assume he drank too much wine . 
Mr. Fudge said gruffly : 
- You only know half the story . 
The worst thing he did was to know little . 
Rosmerta's voice was full of curiosity : 
- What is the worst ? 
You mean there's something else worse than killing the poor guys ? 
Mr. Fudge said : 
- - right . 
- I can not believe it . 
What could be worse ? 
Asked Professor McGonagall . 
- Do you remember when he was at Hogwarts ? 
So do you remember who is his best friend ? 
Mrs. Rosmerta smiled and said , 
- Of course I remember . 
Who does not see them always together , right ? 
The number of times they were so insecure me , and oh , they often made me laugh to death . 
It's a pair of identical : Sirius Black and James Potter . 
Harry dropped the empty glass in his hand , causing a croaking sound . 
Ron kicked it off . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- - right . 
Black and Potter . 
The two gang leaders are their little gang . 
Of course , they are both very clever , intelligent , and beyond . 
I do not think we have ever had a pair with any of them . 
Hagrid smiled : 
- I'm sure . 
Fred and George dare to be called off guard with their games . 
Professor Flitwick explains : 
- One could mistake Black and Potter as two brothers ! 
Can not be separated ! 
Mr. Fudge said : 
- Of course they are very close . 
Potter trusts Black more than any other friend . 
Nothing changed even after they graduated . 
Black is best when James is married to Lily . 
Then they ask Black to godfather for Harry Potter . 
Of course Harry did not know this . 
You can imagine how miserable the boy is . 
Mrs. Rosmerta whispered : 
" Is it because Black turns out to be a fellow shipmate with whom everyone knows someone ? " 
" Even worse , my dear . " 
Mr. Fudge lowered his voice again and continued with low voices : 
- Not many people know that the Potter couple know that everyone knows that someone is searching for them . 
Dumbledore , of course , is a tireless fighter against the One who knows anyone , who has some spies . 
One of the spies 
he told her and he warned James and Lily immediately . 
You told them to hide . 
Well , of course it is not easy to escape Who is well known who is . 
Dumbledore pointed out the best way for them was to use the Faithful Spell . 
Mrs. Rosmerta listened attentively to her breathing : 
- What is the charm ? 
Professor Flitwick cleared his throat and said , 
- It is an extremely complicated enchantment that includes the magical hide behind a secret inside a single soul . 
Information is hidden inside a selected person , known as the Secret Holder , and thus can not be exposed - of course , unless the Holder discloses it . 
As long as the Secret Holder is kept secret , even if everyone knows that someone is searching all over the village where James and Lily lived for years can not find them , even he There was no way to find them . 
Rosmerta whispered : 
- So Black is the Potter's Secret Holder ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- - of course . 
James Potter told Dumbledore that Sirius Black would rather die than reveal where they were , that Sirius Black was also planning to hide ... so Dumbledore was still not sure . 
I also remember asking him to be the Secret Holder for the Potter family . 
Mrs. Rosmerta gasped . 
" Are you suspicious of Sirius Black ? " 
Professor McGonagall said gloomily : 
" You know that somebody close to the Potter family often reports to the One who knows their best . 
Actually I have had a suspicion that someone on our side has betrayed and transferred our information to the One that everyone knows is someone . 
- But James Potter insisted on Sirius Black ? 
Mr. Fudge said heavily : 
- - right . 
And then , just one week after using the Middle Faith Charm ... 
Mrs. Rosmerta breathed : 
- Black betrayed them ? 
- - right . 
Black has lost the role of double agent , he is willing to declare his public support for the One who is known to anyone , and he seems to be doing this on the death of the Potter family . 
But , as we all know , everyone knows that someone has fallen victim to the newborn Harry Potter . 
Loss of power , weakened awful , Everyone knows that someone has to run away from the bathroom . 
And this really made Sirius Black a very difficult situation . 
His boss was at the point where he , Sirius Black , revealed the face of the traitor . 
He can do nothing but run away ... 
Hagrid said so loudly that a half of the restaurant suddenly became silent : 
- A guy turned bad dirty ! 
Professor McGonagall reminded : 
- Suit ! 
Growled Hagrid : 
- I met him ! 
I was the last person to see him before he killed so many people ! 
I was the one who rescued Harry Potter from the house 
crushed her three cheeks after they were killed ! 
I just took it out of the pile of waste , the poor kid ... the poor one , on the forehead a scar , his parents died ... 
At that time , Sirius Black appeared , in the motorcycle he usually rides . 
I never thought of what he was doing there . 
I do not know he is the Potter's Secret Holder ! 
I thought he had just heard the news that anyone who knew someone was attacking the Potter family should run to see what he could do to help them . 
At that moment his entire body trembled , his face white . 
And then , do you know what I did ? I HAVE ANOTHER NAME OF THE KILLER ! 
Hagrid roared . 
Professor McGonagall remarks : 
- Hagrid , please tell me ! 
- How did I know he was not sad about Potter's death ? 
He just bothered to everyone who everyone knows who it is . 
And he told me : Give me Harry , Hagrid , I'm his godfather , I ' ll take care of him . 
Father cha ! 
But I received Dumbledore's order , so I told Black : No , Dumbledore said it would be with his aunt's family . 
Black fiercely protested , but eventually he justified himself . 
He told me to take his motorcycle and take Harry to his aunt . 
He said , ' I do not need it anymore . ' 
- I should have known something was going on at that moment ... 
He liked his flying car , so why did he give it to me ? 
Why did not he need to use it ? 
It is also easy to turn over his mask . 
Dumbledore knew he was the Potter's Secret Holder . 
He had to fly high away that night , he knew that only a few hours later the Ministry of Magic would pursue . 
- Hey , at that time I will give Harry what he will be ? 
I bet he would throw the boy out in the middle of the sea ! That is the son of his best friend ! 
But when a sorceress is back on the Dark side , there is nothing and no one means anything to him . 
After Hagrid's story was a long silence . 
Rosmerta said in a satisfying voice : 
- But he did not end up losing his goal ? 
The Magicians caught him the next day ! 
Mr. Fudge cried bitterly : 
- Oh ! 
If only we could do that ! 
Not that we are the ones who figured out Sirius Black . 
It was Peter Pettigrew , another friend of the Potter family . 
Of course , the grief goes mad and when he learns Sirius Black is the Potter's Secret Holder , Peter Pettigrew goes to Black himself . 
Mrs. Rosmerta asked : 
- Pettigrew à ... 
Is not the fat boy always pursuing Black - Potter puppets around the Hogwarts school ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- It is Black and Potter worshipers like hero . 
It's not exactly Black and Potter's team in terms of intelligence . 
I'm usually a bit tight with it . 
You can understand now how much I regret ... 
Hearing Professor McGonagall's voice felt like she had just had a terrible headache . 
Mr. Fudge kindly said : 
- Behold , Minerva . 
Pettigrew died a heroic death . 
Muggle witnesses - of course we had to erase their memories immediately - they told us about how Pettigrew had put Black on the road . 
They see Pettigrew sobbing : Lily and James ; Sirius ! 
How can you ... ? 
Then Pettigrew pulled out his wand . 
But , of course , Black is quicker . 
Pettigrew blasted , crumbled like bran ... 
Professor McGonagall blushed and said , 
- - Little fool 
Little boy 
He never had the slightest hope in the duel ... it should have been left to the Ministry of Magic to handle ... 
Hagrid muttered angrily : 
" I tell you , I caught Sirius Black before Pettigrew , I would not have taken my wand with a wand - I would have broken his legs , his arms . 
Fudge interrupted . 
" I'm not aware what you're saying , Hagrid ! " 
Once Sirius Black had been cornered , no one was expecting him , except the well - trained Dwarf Masters of the Law Enforcement Task Force . 
I was the Vice - Minister for the Disaster , and I was one of the first people to appear at the scene after Black had killed the men . 
I ... I will never forget . 
Sometimes I still dream of seeing that scene again . 
The middle of the road was a huge hole , so deep that it broke down the sewer . 
The body scattered everywhere . 
Muggle people cry . 
And Black was standing there laughing , with what could have been Pettigrew's body in front of him ... a bunch of bloody robes and ... and some ... crumbs ... 
Fudge's voice stopped abruptly . 
There was a sound of the nose being sullen . 
Then he continued choking : 
- I heard the story , Rosmerta . 
Twenty employees of the Magic Law Enforcement Team won Black . 
And Pettigrew was awarded the Merlin Medal , which I think was a great consolation for Pettigrew's mother . 
From there , Black was imprisoned in Azkaban until ... 
Mrs. Rosmerta breathed a long breath . 
- Minister , is he really crazy ? 
Mr. Fudge said slowly : 
- I wish I could say he was crazy . 
I'm sure his boss's failure has disoriented him for some time . 
The killing of Pettigrew and the Muggle of the nineteen civilians was a desperate act of despair - cruel ... nonsense . 
But I met him in Azkaban prison last time when I went to inspect it . 
You know , most of the prisoners there just sit in the dark and murmur themselves to themselves , the floods are no longer conscious . 
But I'm amazed at how good Black is . 
He talked to me sound wise . 
Damn it . 
People thought he was just bored . 
He asked me to read the newspaper , very calm and polite , saying he had left the crossword . 
Oh , I was amazed to find that the Azkaban dictators did not seem to have much influence on him - and he was detained in one of the most well - guarded places , as you know . 
Outside his cell door there was a dementor , day or night . 
Mrs. Rosmerta asked again : 
- But the Minister , he escaped from prison out to do what ? ... 
Oh , geez , Minister , did he escape from prison to join forces with anyone who knows anyone is not ? 
Fudge ignored the direct answer : 
- I dare say it is . . 
oh ... his next plan . 
But we hope to catch Sirius Black soon before he's done the trick . 
I have to say that when someone who knows that nobody is single friends is not a story ... but when he assembled the hands of the faithful ... I shudder to think that he will How quickly emerged how mighty . 
There was a clatter on the wooden floor , someone had dropped his glass . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
" You know , Mr. Fudge , if you're going to have dinner with the Principal , we should go back to the castle soon . " 
With a pair of feet in front of Harry's eyes , they stood up again to support their master's weight ; dresses flickered through the children's eyes , and Rosmerta's glistening heels were hidden behind the beer . 
The door of the Three Brooms opened again , a wind of snow rushed into the room , then the teacher went out . 
- Harry ? 
Ron and Hermione poked their heads under the table . 
Both of them looked at Harry , unable to speak . 
Chapter 11 
LIGHTNING 
Harry had no idea what it was like to get back to the Dukes ' secret hold and go through the tunnel again to return to the castle . 
He just knew that the return was almost no time , and it was hard to see what he was doing , because his mind was still echoing the story he had heard . 
Why has not anyone told her that story ? 
Dumbledore , Hagrid , Mr. Weasley , Mr. Fudge ... 
Why has not anyone previously mentioned the fact that Harry's father died from being betrayed by one of his best friends ? 
Ron and Hermione watched Harry anxiously for dinner , not daring to talk about what they heard , because Percy was sitting right next to them . 
As they went upstairs , into the busy common room , Fred and George detonated half a dozen bombs in the excitement of the excited atmosphere at the end of the school year . 
Not wanting Fred and George to ask if he's going to play Hogsmeade , Harry silently sneaks up into the empty bedroom and goes straight to his bed . 
He pushed the books aside and quickly found what he was looking for - the leather souvenir anarchist Hagrid had donated it two years ago , full of his parents ' it . 
Harry sat on the bed , pulled the screen around , and began flipping through the pages , until ... 
Harry stopped at the photo of his parents ' wedding day . This is the three of them waving to him , beaming , the black hair that Harry inherited is flushed in all directions . this is her cheeks , radiant with happiness , hand in hand with her father . 
And here ... it must be him . 
Groom at the wedding ... 
Harry had never thought of him before . 
If it is not known that this is the same person then Harry will never be able to guess Black in this old picture . 
His face was not as deep and white as wax , but bright and handsome . 
Did not know when he took this photo he became a Voldemort's henchman ? 
Did he plan to kill those who were standing beside him ? 
Is he conscious that he will be in prison for twelve years in Azkaban , and that twelve years will make no one recognize him ? 
" But the Princes of Azkaban do not seem to have much influence on him , " Harry thought , gazing into his handsome , smiling face . " He did not hear the cry of his mother when the dementors came too close . " 
Harry closed the album , picked it up , put it back in the closet , took off his shirt and took off his glasses , and then went to bed , even hanging curtains obscuring his own world . 
The bedroom door opens . 
Ron's voice faltered : 
- Harry ? 
Harry lay still , pretending to be asleep . 
He heard Ron leave the room . 
He rolled his back on his back , opening his two eyes . 
Such a hatred , it was never known before , is now absorbed into him as poison . 
He could see Black laughing at it through the darkness , as if someone had just pasted the picture in his album in his eye . 
He looked , as if someone had just shone a movie in front of him : Sirius Black exploded Pettigrew ( who was like Neville Longbottom ) into a thousand fragments . 
Harry could hear the agitated , murmuring whisper ( though he did not know what Black's voice was like ) : It happened , master ... 
Potter chose me as Secret Holder ... 
And then another voice made a horrible laugh , the laughter that Harry had heard from deep inside his mind when the dementors of Azkaban approached . 
* * * 
- Harry , look at you ... you are so ugly . 
Harry had been awake until dawn . 
When he wakes up , he finds the bedroom empty . 
He dressed and walked down the stairs to the common room . It was almost empty , except that Ron was eating Californian candy while rubbing his belly ; and Hermione had just finished her work on three tables . 
Harry asked : 
- Where is everyone ? 
- go away ! 
Do not remember today is the first day of the holiday season huh ? 
Said Ron , staring at Harry's face carefully : 
- Nearing lunch time , I was about to wake up . 
Harry sat down on an armchair next to the fireplace . 
Snow still falling outside the window . 
Crookshanks sprawled in front of the fireplace looking like a colorful carpet . 
Hermione scanned Harry's face nervously : 
- You look not very well , you know ? 
Harry replied , 
- I'm fine ! 
Hermione exchanged eye contact with Ron , then said to Harry : 
" Harry , you heard us say that you were really upset about the story we heard yesterday . 
But the problem is , you can not do anything stupid . 
Harry asked : 
- What do you do ? 
Said Ron : 
- As if to find Black . 
Harry could tell that his two friends had summed up the conversation while he was still asleep . 
It does not hurt at all . 
Hermione pleaded : 
- You would not do that , Harry ? 
Ron added : 
- Because Black is not worth the risk . 
Harry looked at his two friends . 
They do not seem to understand . 
- Do you know what I hear every time a bureaucrat Azkaban comes so close to me ? 
Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads , terrified faces . 
Harry continued : 
- I could hear my mother crying and begging Voldemort . 
And if you hear your cheeks crying like that , before being killed , you can not forget quickly . 
And if you know who thought his best friend was betrayed and pointing to Voldemort's murder ... 
Hermione was agitated : 
- You can not do anything Harry ! 
The Azkaban dictators will capture Black and send him to Azkaban Prison and he will pay for it ! 
" You heard Fudge , too . " 
Black was not influenced by the Azkaban dementors as ordinary people . 
The Azkaban dungeon is not a place to punish him as for others . 
Ron stressed the most : 
- So what's your opinion ? 
You want to ... want to kill Black or do ? 
Hermione snapped Ron in a panicked voice : 
- do not be silly ! 
Harry was not going to kill anyone , did he ? 
Again , Harry did not reply . 
He does not know what he wants to do . 
He only knew that while Black was outlawing it without doing anything , it was unbearable . 
He suddenly said : 
- Malfoy sure knows all this . 
Do you remember what he said to you in the poison class ? " If it was me , I would personally hunt him ... 
I want to take revenge myself ... " 
Ron furiously said , 
- Now you listen to Malfoy's cries and not listen to our advice ? 
You hear this ... 
Do you know what Pettigrew's cheeks got after Black beat him ? 
My father said ... 
One of the Merlin Medal , and one Pettigrew's box . This is the most genetic part of him that can be collected again . 
Black is a crazy guy , Harry , he's dangerous ... 
Ignoring Ron's words , Harry continued : 
" Malfoy's father must have told her . 
He is in the circle of Voldemort ... 
Ron angrily interrupted : 
- Can you please say that everyone knows who it is ? 
- ... so obviously Malfoy knew Black was the wrong man for Voldemort ... 
- ... and Malfoy was very pleased to see you explode into a million pieces , like Pettigrew . 
Think of it , Malfoy just wished for you to die before it faced you in the Quidditch match ! 
Harry's eyes sparkled , she said , 
- Harry , please , please think a little . 
Black did a horrible , terrible thing , but you should not risk yourself , just because it was what Black wanted ... 
Oh , Harry , you ' ll fall in Black if you're going to find him . 
Your mother did not want you to be harmed , right ? 
Your mother does not want to let you find Black ! 
Harry said briefly : 
" I will never know what my parents want , because , " thanks to Black , I never talked to my parents again . 
All of them are silent , too now Crookshanks stretched out the way the radio , bending the legs full of claws . 
Ron's shirt was shaking . 
Ron looked around , obviously looking for another topic to change the atmosphere : 
- Look , this is holiday season , close to Christmas day . 
Or are we ... down to Hagrid ? 
It's too late to visit him . 
Hermione said : 
- - Can not ! 
Harry is not allowed out of the castle that Ron ! 
Harry straightened up and said , 
- Oh , let's go ! 
Can I ask him why he did not mention Black when he told me the whole story of his parents ? 
Apparently the lengthy discussion of Sirius Black was not Ron's intention . 
He hurriedly said , 
- Or we play chess . 
Do you play the ball ? 
Brother Percy left him a set of ... 
Harry resolutely : 
- - Are not . 
We went to see Hagrid ! 
So all three of them went to the bedroom to get the hood and go through the port of the portrait ( " Stand up and fight , doggy dogs ! " ) , Then down , past the court . The station was empty , going through the huge oak door . 
They walked slowly through the lawn , the footprints forming a deep groove through the spongy snow , their socks and lapels were soaked and frozen . 
The Forbidden Forest looked like it had been drained , each plant covered with silver snow , and Hagrid's hut was like a cream cake . 
Ron knocked on the door , but there was no answer . 
Hermione shivered under the hood , she said , 
- Did not he go away ? 
Ron pressed his ear to the door . 
It says : 
- There is a strange sound . 
Let's hear ... is it Fang's voice ? 
Harry and Hermione also pressed their ear to the door . 
From inside the hut , let out a low moan . 
Ron said , 
- We should go help others quickly ! 
Harry punched the door , calling out : 
- Hagrid , Hagrid ! 
Are you in the house ? 
There was a heavy footstep sound , and the door opened with a clang . 
Hagrid stood with red eyes and swollen eyes . 
Tears fell down on the leather jacket . 
Seeing the kids , he roared to tears and rushed to hug Harry : 
- I heard it all ! 
Hagrid was big at least two people , so this was not a laughable scene . 
Harry hugged Hagrid , who was saved by Ron and Hermione by grabbing one of Hagrid's arms and trying to help him up , and then Harry helped him back inside the hut . 
Hagrid let the children lead him to a chair , sat down on the table , sobbing uncontrollably . 
His face was soaked , his tears falling down on his tangled beard . 
Asked Hermione , 
- Hagrid , what's up ? 
Harry noticed a letter that looked like an open letter on the table . 
- What is this , Hagrid ? 
Hagrid cried harder , but he also pushed the letter to Harry . 
She picked up a big read : 
Dear Mr. Hagrid , 
Adding to our investigation of the attack by a Pakistani student on a student in his class , we received the assurance of Professor Dumbledore that he was not responsible for the incident . it's worth it . 
Ron patted Harry on the shoulder . 
" Well , that's fine , Hagrid ! " 
But Hagrid continued to sob , and one of his great hands gestured for Harry to read : 
However , we must acknowledge our concern about the Code . 
We have decided to take a look at Mr. Lucius Malfoy's letter of complaint , and therefore the matter will be referred to the Dangerous Goods Commission . 
The trial will take place on April 20 and we request that you personally appear with the Equator at the Commission office in London on the date of the appointment . 
While waiting for the trial , Bang Ma must be chained and quarantined . 
Sincerely ... 
At the end of the letter is a list of School Board Members . 
Said Ron : 
- - Gosh ! 
But you said Buckbeak is not a bad Code , the fish is going to pass . 
Hagrid shook his head in anger , wiping his sleeveless eyes : 
- You do not know the animal faces at the Dangerous Goods Commission ! 
They hunt all those interesting creatures ! 
A sudden sound from a corner of Hagrid's hut causes Ron , Hermione and Harry to crunch together . 
The Buckbeak was lying in a corner , his mouth chewing something on the floor . 
Hagrid hiccups : 
- You can not leave it tied up in the snow . 
A trunk alone ! 
It's Christmas season ! 
Harry , Ron and Hermione looked at each other . 
They never agreed with Hagrid about what he called " interesting creatures " and others called " monstrous monsters " . 
On the other hand , there does not appear to be any particular danger to you 
Buckbeak . 
Actually , according to Hagrid's standards , the Buckbeak was absolutely lovely . 
Hermione sat down and placed her small hand on Hagrid's huge arm : 
- Hagrid , you will have to give evidence to have eloquent defense . 
I'm sure you can prove that Buckbeak is harmless . 
Hagrid still sobs : 
- Nothing can change ! Devils on the board except that , the flood they have closed mouth to eat money Lucius Malfoy ! 
Afraid of him too ! 
If you lose the case , Buckbeak ... 
Hagrid put a finger over his neck , cried out , and shook his head forward , buried his face in his arms . 
Harry asked : 
- What about Mr. Humboldt ? 
Hagrid laments : 
- He has done enough for you . 
You too have enough trouble with the Azkaban dignitaries around the castle , and Sirius Black is in the wrong place ... 
Ron and Hermione glanced quickly at Harry , as if expecting him to open his mouth . Hagrid did not tell him the truth about Sirius Black . 
But Harry could not help it , especially when he was witnessing Hagrid's fear and grief . 
It says : 
- Hagrid , do not give up . 
Hermione is right , I need a good defense . 
Can you call us a witness ... 
Said Hermione thoughtfully : 
- I'm sure you read about a Code case that the Maine was acquitted . 
I ' ll look into that for you , Hagrid , to see exactly what happened . 
Hagrid cried louder than before . 
Harry and Hermione looked at Ron for help . 
Said Ron : 
- ... 
Do you go to Hagrid's tea ? 
Harry glared at Ron . 
Ron shrugged his shoulders . 
- that's what my mom does whenever someone is upset . 
Finally , after more pledges of help from the children , along with a fizzy tea set in front of him , Hagrid began blowing his nose with a towel the size of a tablecloth , and then to speak : 
- They are right . 
Uncle can not afford the bias . 
Must be self up ... 
The fawning dog fumbled out of under the table and put his head on Hagrid's knee . 
He patted Fang with one hand , and the other wiped his eyes with tears . 
He said , 
- Recently I am no longer myself . 
Just worry Buckbeak . 
And my class , no one likes it anymore ... 
Hermione lies blatantly : 
- We love it ! 
Ron crossed his fingers as a sign of sewing under the table , saying : 
- yes , my lessons are very good ! 
Oh ... How do you spit it out ? 
Said Hagrid , 
- Dead . 
Eat too many salads . 
Ron's distortion : 
- Oh , why ? 
Hagrid continued : 
" And the princes of Azkaban made him unbearable , with all sorts of things . 
Every time I want to drink a glass of candles in the Three Spirit Shop is to go through them ... as if you were thrown into hell Azkaban again ... 
He was silent , taking a sip of tea . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked up from their seats . 
They never heard from Hagrid about the old man who had been in Azkaban prison a short time ago . 
After a moment of silence , Hermione shyly said : 
" You must be very unhappy , Hagrid ? " 
Hagrid said quietly , 
- You can not imagine . 
Never to anywhere like that . 
I thought you were crazy ! 
The horrible thing in my head was the harshness ... the day that I was kicked out of Hogwarts ... the day my father died ... the day that I had to let Norbert go ... 
Hagrid's eyes were full of tears . 
Norbert was a child dragon that Hagrid had won by playing a card game . 
" Only for Azkaban for a while is that people no longer really remember who they are . 
And people no longer see the meaning of life anymore . 
I just hope he died in bed ... 
When they let go , they feel like they are reborn , everything goes back to their own , the most beautiful feeling in the world . 
Please note , Azkaban dementors do not drop out ... 
Hermione said : 
- But you are innocent ! 
Hagrid snorted . 
- What does that mean to them ? 
They do not need to . 
As long as there are a few hundred people imprisoned with them in order to keep their fun , they do not care about who is guilty or who is innocent . 
Hagrid paused for a moment , gazing at his tea . 
Then he said softly : 
- Think about letting Buckbeak go ... 
Try to make it fly away ... but how to explain to a Code is that it must find the soul to escape ? 
... but also afraid of breaking the law ... 
He looked up at the three children , tears rolling down his cheeks : 
- Uncle never want to go back to Azkaban prisons . 
o 0 o 
Although not very happy , but Hagrid's visit turns out to have the effect that both Ron and Hermione are not expecting . 
Although Harry can not forget Sirius Black , he can not but contemplate the idea of ​​ revenge if he wants to help Hagrid win the case against the Dangerous Goods Commission . 
The next day , Harry , Ron and Hermione came to the library and returned to the empty living room with the heavy books they hoped might help in compiling an excuse for Buckbeak . 
The three of them sat in front of the fire , fluttering over each page of dusty books , rewriting famous lawsuits of looting wolves ; Sometimes we exchange a few sentences when they find something that seems relevant . 
- Here is this ... 
A case in 1772 ... but Bang Bang was convicted ... ,, what did they do it ... so disgusting ... 
- This is not useful , here it is ... 
A Manticore who savagely attacked someone in 1296 , left the Manticore dead ... oh no , it was just that people were so frightened , no one dared to come near it . ... 
At the same time , at other places in the castle , the annual Christmas decorations were raised , despite the fact that few students stayed at the castle to enjoy them . 
The chain of gold paper and mistletoe branch hanging along the corridor , the mysterious light shining from within each armor and the hall is decorated as usual with twelve Christmas trees glittering the golden star . 
The deliciously delicious food spread across the hallway , and on the Christmas Eve , the scent grew so ferocious that the Scrabbers had to poke out of the shelter in Ron's pockets to sniff . The atmosphere was full of hope . 
On the morning of Christmas , Ron woke Harry by throwing a pillow in his head : 
- - HEY ! 
Gifts ! 
Harry sat with his glasses on the bridge of his nose , squinting through the twilight space to see a small heap of presents at the foot of his bed . 
And Ron ripped the paper wrapped in his present pieces : 
- Another sweater of your cheek ... again the color of wine ... you see if you were donated one ? 
Harry also has one . 
Mrs. Weasley gave him a purple woolen sweater woven with a Gryffindor lion in front of his chest ; a dozen homemade pies , some Christmas cakes and a box of peanut candy . 
As Harry placed the presents aside , he saw a long , sickly package at the bottom . 
Ron leaned over to look , his hands just opened a gift pack with a pair of socks also color chat . 
She asked : 
- - What is this ? 
- He knows . 
Harry tore his package and gasped for breath in front of a splendid , glittering broom that rolled to his bed . 
Ron let go of his socks and jumped out of bed to look closer . 
He said hoarsely : 
- I can not believe it ! 
It is the lightning bolt , like a broom in the dream that Harry has 
Every day to stand out in the alley . 
The broomstick sparkled as Harry picked up . 
Feeling the broom was shaking , Harry let go of his hand . 
The broomsticks stood up in the air without anyone else , at a precise height for Harry to climb up . 
Its eyes flickered from the golden registration number at the tip of the broomstick down to the smooth , straight branches of the poplar , perfectly formed into the broomstick . 
Asked Ron in a low voice : 
- Who gave you this gift ? 
Harry said : 
- - Is there a card attached ? 
Ron tore open the pack of lightning bolt . 
- - Nothing at all ! 
Wow , who's gonna spend all that gold for you ? 
Harry felt dizzy : 
" Eh ... I bet it's not Aunt Dursley's aunt . 
Ron now walks around the lightning bolt , staring at each of its bright lights : 
- I bet this is Dumbledore's gift . 
Once you sent anonymously to the invisibility cloak ... 
Harry said : 
- But the invisibility cloak is my father's gift . 
Dumbledore was just handed over to me . 
Dumbledore could not spend hundreds of Galleon on his own . 
You can not give a student like this ... 
Said Ron : 
- That is why you do not say that your god gave you ! In case there are guys like Malfoy , you are the hardest student . 
Hey , Harry ... 
Ron burst out laughing : 
- Malfoy ! 
Wait until it sees you ride this god broom ! 
It will grow like a pig . This is a standard international broom , yes ! 
Harry caressed his hand along the broomstick , murmuring : 
- I can not believe it ! 
Who is it ? 
Meanwhile Ron rolled over Harry's bed and laughed intently at the thought of Malfoy . 
Trying to restrain himself , Ron said , 
- - I knew ! 
I know who can be - Lupine . 
- - What ? 
Harry exclaimed and started laughing at his stomach : 
- Master Lupine ? 
Listen , if you have so much gold , you can buy yourself some new dresses . 
Said Ron : 
- - right . 
But I like you very much . 
When your Nimbus broom is consumed , you go away again ; Perhaps he heard again and he decided to go to Alley Cross to buy this lightning bolt . 
Surprised Harry : 
- What do you mean by absenteeism ? 
He was sick when he was playing in that match . 
Said Ron : 
- Oh , Lupine is not in vaginal disease . 
I was there , scrubbed the dad urine because Mr. Filch forbid , do you remember ? 
Harry looked at Ron thoughtfully . 
" I do not think Lupine has enough money to buy something like this . " 
Hermione walked into the room , dressed in pajamas , Crookshanks handcuffed , and the cat was as irritating as the rope she had wrapped around her neck . 
- What are you laughing ? 
Ron hurriedly shot the Scrabbers at the bottom of the bed and stuffed the old mouse in the sleeping bag it was wearing . 
Shouted Ron : 
- do not bring that one here ! 
But Hermione did not listen . 
She dropped Crookshanks into the empty bed of Seamus and gaped at the Lightning Broom . 
- Oh , Harry ! Who gave you that ? 
Harry said : 
- - Who knows ! 
There is no card attached . 
Harry was suprised to see Hermione no longer nervous or inquisitive about the news . 
Hermione's face faded , and she bit her lip . 
Asked Ron : 
- What are you doing ? 
Hermione replied slowly : 
- I do not know , but there is something wrong , right ? I mean this is supposed to be a broom , right ? 
Ron exhaled a long , resentful breath . 
It says : 
- this is the best broom in the world , Hermione ơi ! 
- Then it must be so horrible ... 
Ron said happily : 
- Can be more than all the brooms of the Slytherin team gathered . 
Hermione said : 
" Then ... who sent Harry such a bundle of money , without even telling Harry who sent it ? 
Ron impatiently : 
- Cot need to know . 
Oh , Harry , can we try it out ? 
I'm home ? 
Cried Hermione , 
- I think the best thing is nobody can ride on that broom ! 
Harry and Ron looked at Hermione . 
Said Ron : 
" So what do you do with the broom ? " screaming ? 
But before Hermione could open her mouth to answer , the Crookshanks launched from Seamus's bed , aiming at Ron's chest . 
Shouted Ron . 
- DESTROOM - IT - RA - NO - HERE ! 
Crookshanks clawed at Ron's nightgown and Scrabbers furiously ran over Ron's shoulder to run away . 
Ron grabbed the Scrabbers tail and kicked a Crookshanks , not aiming for it , so the cat flew in a cage at the foot of Harry's bed , causing himself to fall and Ron jumping in . place , howling pain due to leg joints . 
Crookshanks's tentacles suddenly stood up . 
A small whistle froze in the room . It was a scissors lens that popped itself out of Dursleys unclothed socks and was spinning on the floor . 
Harry leaned down and picked up the scent lens . 
- I forgot it ! 
I do not carry that socks unless the same reluctant ... 
The Tinted Glass still twirled and hissed in Harry's palm . 
Crookshanks grinned at the lens . 
Ron frowned , sitting on the bed , Harry rubbed his toes : 
" Good thing you brought the cat out of here , Hermione ! " 
Hermione fumbles out of the room , Crookshanks ' yellow eyes glaring at Ron . 
Ron turned to Harry : 
- Can not you make it go away ? 
Harry tucked the Tactical lens back into his socks and threw it into the chest . 
Now all the sound that Harry could hear was just Ron's painful moan from pain and anger . 
Mouse Scrabbers shrank in Ron's hands . 
It was a long time before Harry saw that old mouse stuck out of Ron's shirt pocket . 
Harry was astonished to find that the Scrabbers had a bumpy nose that now had only bony skin , and the hairs had fallen apart . 
Harry said : 
- Did not look well ? 
Said Ron : 
- It is stressed too ! 
If the big ball is stupid enough to leave it alone , it's fine ! 
But Harry remembers the shopkeeper in the Mysterious Animal Shop about mice , saying that they only lived for as long as three years . 
Harry thought this Scrabbers must have powers that have not yet revealed , otherwise it is living the last months of his life . 
And although Ron always complains that the Scrabbers are completely useless and boring , Harry is sure that Ron will be very upset if Scrabbers die ! 
The Christmas spirit was clearly frail in Gryffindor's common room that morning . 
Hermione locked Crookshanks in the girls ' bedroom , but she was still angry at Ron for having Crookshanks cut Ron down ; while Ron was still mad about the Crookshanks newest attack on the Scrabbers . 
Harry gave up , could not get them to talk to each other . 
She had no idea what the lightning bolt was , which she carried down to the common room . 
For some reason that seemed to make Hermione more crazy . 
She did not say anything , but looked up at the broom , as if the broom also disparaged her cat . 
At the time of the meal , the three of us went down to the Great Hall , where the dining tables of the four houses were hung up on the wall , and in the middle of the room there was only one table , seating for twelve . . 
Professors Dumbledore , McGonagall , Snape , Sprout , and Flitwick sat at the table , along with supervisor Filch . 
Filch replaced his usual brown coat with a tattered , old - fashioned shrimp coat . 
Outside the group of Harry , Ron and Hermione , there were only three other students : the first two years of intense tension and one fifth of the Slytherin had a very sad face . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione went to the table , Dumbledore said : 
- - Merry Christmas ! 
Sit down , sit down the children ! 
We only have a few people should display all the tables of the house seems a little fool . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table . 
- Bursting up ! 
Dumbledore enthusiastically said , then handed Snape a big gun . 
Snape took a reluctant look and jerked it . 
An explosion sounded like gunfire , the cannon flew up , splitting out , revealing a large spiked conical hat , on top of which a stuffed vulture . 
Harry remembered his son Kook , glance to meet Ron's eyes , both children grinned . 
Snape's teacher clenched his thin lips and pushed the hat toward Dumbledore , who immediately changed the cloak he was wearing on his head . 
Bring the radiance around the table and advise people : 
- The only cup ! 
When Harry was picking up his baked potato , the door to the Great Hall opened again . 
Professor Trelawney appeared , gliding toward everyone as if he were sliding on the wheels . 
She put on a green dress decorated with beads on this great occasion , making her look like a blue fly ball than ever before . 
Dumbledore stood up : 
- this is an interesting surprise , Miss Sybill ! 
Professor Trelawney said in her most mysterious voice : 
- Dear Principal , I have seen the prophecy and I am surprised to find that I gave up my light lunch to join you . 
Who am I daring to argue about the destiny of destiny ? 
So I immediately rushed out of my Ivory Tower , and I beg you to forgive me for this delay ... 
Dumbledore eyes flashing glare : 
- Of course , of course ! let me pull you a chair ... 
And , in fact , he pulled a chair from the air with his wand . 
This chair waited a few seconds before falling down between Professor Snape and Professor Mc / Gonagall . 
However , Professor Trelawney has not yet sat down ; Her huge eyes swept around the table , and then she uttered a scream like a small scream : 
- Dear Principal , I dare not ! 
If I attend this party , I ' ll be the thirteenth ! 
No more bad luck anymore ! Never forget that when thirteen people eat together , the first person to stand up will be the first to die ! 
Professor McGonagall impatiently : 
" Let's try it , Miss Sybill ! " 
Please sit down , the turkey is about to cool as ice . 
Professor Trelawney hesitated , then sat on the empty chair , his eyes closed , his mouth tightening , as if he wanted the lightning to strike at the table . 
Professor McGonagall poured a large spoonful of food near him , asking : 
- Do not use cow's heart , Miss Sybill ? 
Professor Trelawney ignored Professor McGonagall . 
She opened her eyes again , looked around again and said , 
- But where is my beloved professor Lupine ? 
Dumbledore gave everyone the comfort of eating and saying , 
- I'm afraid the miserable teacher is sick again . 
It is not as bad as it was when it came out on Christmas day . 
Professor McGonagall raised his eyebrows and asked : 
" But you must have prophesied it first , Miss Sybill ? " 
Professor Trelawney threw Professor McGonagall a cold look . 
Her voice hardened : 
" Of course I know first , Minerva . 
But one does not claim to be the fact that you are the One - the - know - all . 
I often behaved as if I was not obsessed by the Inner Eye , so as not to panic . 
Professor McGonagall replied bitterly : 
- That's it . 
That explains a lot . 
Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became less of a mystery : 
- Sister Minerva , you must know that I predicted that Professor Lupine would not stay with us for a long time . 
He himself is aware that his time is short . 
When I gave him the crystal ball , he dodged a great deal of confusion ... 
Professor McGonagall said curtly : 
- Imagine only ! 
Dumbledore , however , was a little upset at the end of the conversation between Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney . 
" I'm sure Professor Lupine is not an immediate danger . 
Mr. Snape , did you make any special remedies for Lupine ? 
The Slytherin master said : 
- Yes , Mr. President : 
Dumbledore said : 
- That's good ! 
Then he will recover soon ... 
Behold , Derek , have you tried this Anglo - Saxon ? 
This dish is delicious ! 
Directly talked to by the Principal , the first kid flushed like Gac . 
He shook hands with the shakes of sausage Dumbledore . 
Professor Trelawney behaved nearly normal until the end of the two - hour party . 
After the Christmas party , Harry and Ron got up first and Professor Trelawney squealed : 
- Devil spirit ! Which one of the two got up first ? Which one ? 
Said Ron , looking uncomfortable at Harry . 
- - I do not know . 
Professor McGonagall coldly said : 
- I'm sure whoever got up before is no different . 
Unless there is a madman carrying a hammer waiting outside the door to make the first flesh out of the hall . 
Ron also laughed . 
Professor Trelawney proved to be outraged . 
Harry said to Hermione : 
- go ? 
Harmione : 
- Not yet . 
I have a few words to say to Professor McGonagall . 
Ron hesitated while walking with Harry to the Hall , where absolutely no madman stood ready . 
Said Ron : 
- Probably the little girl trying to learn a few more . 
When the two went to the portrait hole , Cadogan was still enjoying Christmas with two priests and several Hogwarts prefects and his fat ass . 
He wears a hat , pulls his face up , and holds up a jar of honey to congratulate him : 
- - Christmas ... 
happy ... happy 
Password ! 
Ron replied : 
- - Mad Dog ! 
Mr. Cadogan roared : 
- And I wish you the same ! 
The picture was on one side to allow Ron and Harry to crawl . 
Harry went straight to the bedroom to get Harry's thunderbolt and Hermione's Preserve Guardian Kit , which Hermione had given Harry's birthday , bringing it all downstairs and trying to find something to take care of . . 
However , there is not a single brush to brush , and the brush is bright and shiny so that it can not be polished anymore . 
Harry and Ron could only sit and admire each corner of the broom , until the port was opened again and Hermione came in , followed by Professor McGonagall . 
Even though Professor McGonagall was the Gryffindor chairmate , Harry had only seen her in her room once , and she was told not to say something horrible at that time . 
Harry and Ron both looked at Professor McGonagall , his hand clutching the Lightning Bolt . 
Hermione walked around them , sat down , picked up the nearest book , and buried her head in the book . 
Professor McGonagall said quietly but clearly every hour : 
- Is that it ? 
The professor walks in front of the fireplace to take a closer look at the godly broomstick : 
- Hermione just informed her that she was sent a goddamn broom , did not Harry ? 
Harry and Ron looked at Hermione again . 
They could see the book on the back , the forehead of her little girl is flushed . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Can you see it ? 
But she did not need to wait for the answer to pull the broom out of the two children's hands . 
She carefully checked from the top of the broomstick to the end of the broomstick . 
- Hmmm ! 
No letter or card attached , Harry ? 
Harry whispered , 
- No , sir . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- You understand ... 
Well , Harry , you're afraid you have to confiscate this broom . 
- - The ... 
what ? 
Why ? 
Harry nearly collapsed . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- It needs to be checked for charms . 
Of course she was not an expert , but she dared to say that Hooch and Professor Flitwick would justify it . 
- Subtract it ? 
Ron repeated , as if he thought Professor McGonagall was crazy . 
Professor McGonagall continues : 
- In a few weeks it is done . 
At that time you can get back the broom if the test is sure it is not spell or eavesdropping . 
Said Harry , a little shaky . 
" Dear , sweetheart ... it is not dumb . 
Professor McGonagall said kindly : 
- I can not know for sure that Harry ! 
Only when it explodes , easily . 
So I'm afraid that until we are not sure whether it is cursed or not , we can not belittle it . 
She will inform the children of the situation after the broom . 
Professor McGonagall twisted his heels and brought the Thunderbolt , under the portrait hole . 
Harry stood by her , the High Quality Polishing Box still clenched in his hand . 
But Ron turned back to Hermione : 
- What do you do for McGonagall ? 
Hermione threw the book aside . 
Her face was still rosy , but she stood upright , face to face with Ron in a challenge : 
" Because I think - and Professor McGonagall agrees with me - that the broom can be sent by Sirius Black to Harry ! " 
Chapter 12 
GUARDIAN 
Harry knew Hermione about Miss McGonagall about the lightning bolt , but he still could not help but get angry with her . 
It had only managed the world's tallest broom in a few short hours , but now , only because of Hermione's lack of it , he could not know whether it could still see the broom . that again or not ? 
He made sure that his broom was not tamed , but once the broom was removed with all sorts of checks , it would still be the spirit of the broom . To 
Ron was furious with Hermione . 
According to it , the removal of a lightning bolt while " gin " is no different to commit a criminal offense . 
Hermione was sure she had done the best she could , but she avoided sitting in the living room with Harry and Ron . 
They thought she had found shelter in the library , and they did not bother trying to get her back to the common room . 
The three of them were happy to see all the other students return to school after New Year's Day , and the Gryffindor Tower became crowded . 
On the eve of the new semester , Wood finds Harry to talk : 
- Christmas is not fun ? 
No need to wait for Harry to answer , Wood sat down , lowering his voice : 
- He was thinking through Christmas , Harry . 
After the last battle , you know ... 
If the Azkaban dementors came to the next match ... I mean ... we can not let you ... 
Ờ ... 
Wood stopped suddenly , looking confused . 
Harry said quickly : 
- I'm fixing that . 
Professor Lupine says he can teach you how to get rid of the Azkaban dementors . 
I will start teaching you this week ; He said he would have free time after Christmas . 
Wood exclaimed , " Ah ! " His expression relaxed . 
- Well , if so ... 
I really do not want to lose a Harry like you . 
Did you order a new broom ? 
Harry said : 
- Not yet . 
- - What ? You have to fold up , you know ... I can not ride the stars and fight the Ravenclaws ! 
Ron : 
- He was given a lightning bolt at Christmas . 
- A Lightning Rod ! 
Say no to that ? 
A ... a lightning bolt ? 
Harry murmured , 
- Oliver , do not be so eager . 
I can not keep it anymore . 
It was confiscated . 
Then Harry explained the whole story of why and how his lightning bolt was being ridiculed . 
- Charms ? 
How can the broom be munched ? 
Harry said in a weak voice : 
- Sirius Black . 
It was thought he was chasing me . 
So McGonagall thought he would probably send that to me . 
Putting aside the news that a famous killer was chasing his guards , Wood said : 
- But Black could not buy a lightning bolt ! 
He is wanted ! 
This country is watching him ! 
How could he walk into a high quality Quidditch shop buying a broom ? 
Harry said : 
" I know , but Miss McGonagall still wants to get rid of the broom . " 
Wood was pale . 
I promise : 
- He will talk to her . 
He would make her understand ... a Lightning Rod ... a real lightning bolt ... in our team ... 
She also wants Gryffindor to win just as we want it ... he will make her understand ... a Lightning Rod . 
The next day , the second semester classes began . 
In the chilly January morning , only people who had nothing else to do were new to the school grounds , learning to take care of the Mysterious Creatures , but Hagrid presented a fire full of wild salamanders to buy . For the children , they spent an unusually fun lesson : they went to dry wood and dry leaves to leave the fire for further light , while the lovers of the lizard liked to eat . He crawled up to the cows and burned some wood . 
The lesson of the new semester is not happy ; Professor Trelawney now teaches to handcuffs , and it does not take long for Harry to find out that it has the shortest birth path she has ever seen in her life . 
There is only Black Hawk Down's class where Harry goes to school . 
After speaking to Wood , Harry wants to start studying as soon as possible against the Azkaban dictator . 
At the end of the class , Harry reminded Lupine about his promise , saying , 
- Oh yes , let me see ... 
Eight o ' clock Thursday evening ? 
The study room of the History of Magic is wide enough . 
You will think carefully how we will teach and learn this subject ... 
We can not bring a bureaucrat Azkaban in the castle to practice ... 
As he walked down the corridor to the dining room , Ron said , 
- You still seem sick , right ? 
What do you think you are ? 
Behind the two suddenly resounded a loud tongue impatiently heard loud . It was Hermione , who was sitting at the foot of a suit of armor , rearranging her briefcase ; The bag was so full that it could not be closed . 
Said Ron with an irritated tone : 
- What do you do with the tongue ? 
- Nothing to do ! 
Hermione said in a haughty voice , threw her heavy bag on her shoulder . 
Said Ron : 
- Yes ! 
When we were wondering about Lupine's disease , good luck ... 
With an uproar that provoked people to get mad , Hermione said , 
- Well , that's not very clear ? 
Ron spat : 
- If you do not want to tell us , do not say . 
- Good ! 
Hermione canal lifted his head , walked a water . 
Ron scoffed at Hermione : 
- He did not know anything . 
It just pretends to talk to us again . 
o 0 o 
At eight o ' clock in the evening , Harry left the Gryffindor common room to study in the History of Magic class . 
Arriving , the classroom was empty and dark , Harry used his wand to light the light . 
It only took about five minutes for Lupine to come , carrying a large cage carefully wrapped . 
He lifted the cage up on Professor Binn's desk . 
Harry asked : 
- Teacher , what is that ? 
Lupine took off his jacket and said , 
- - Another Chef . 
He had scoured the castle since Tuesday , fortunately he had caught this child hiding in a filing cabinet of Filch . This is the closest imitation of Azkaban dictator . 
Mr. Kash will turn into a bureaucrat Azkaban when he sees you , so you can practice it against him . 
When you do not use it , you lock it in your room . 
There is a cabinet under the desk of the teacher that Mr. Kuk will be happy . 
- Yes , yes . 
Harry said , trying to pretend he was not scared at all , just glad Lupine found a good dictator for Azkaban . 
Professor Lupine drew his wand , gesturing for Harry to follow him , said : 
- - Then ... 
The mantra that you will try to read and teach your children is a high - level magic , Harry ... , higher than the Standard Level Wizard . 
It is called the Charm . 
Harry asked anxiously : 
- What is the spiritual charm of the teacher ? 
Lupine said : 
- Well , if the charm is used correctly , it will reveal a guardian god . 
This god is a kind of guardian god - against the guardian of Azkaban , the god who will shield me and the Azkabans . 
Harry suddenly imagined his image behind a bulky figure as old Hagrid handled a large stick . 
Professor Lipin continues to explain : 
- Patronus is a kind of positive force , a manifestation of the very things that the dementor Azkaban devoured : hope , happiness , desire for survival - but for the god Guard not ever feel Desperate as a real man , Azkaban dementors can never harm . 
But you have to take care of me , Harry , that Guardian Charms are too high for your level . 
Many people reach the level of mage , but also find it difficult to use the charm missions . 
Curious curiosity : 
- What do you look like ? 
- Depending on how each witch makes this power , the guardian of the witch has its own unique shape . 
- And how do you make the guardian gods appear ? 
- By reciting a mantra , this spell only works when you focus your mind on only a very happy memory . 
Harry tried to remember a happy memory . 
Certainly nothing happened to him during his time at Dursleys home as a happy memory . 
In the end , it was decided that the happiest moment in life was when it was first roasted on a broomstick . 
He tried his best to remember exactly the sensation of supreme joy in his heart at that time . 
It says : 
- Teacher , I'm prepared . 
Lupine cleared his throat : 
- This mantra is like this ... 
Expecto patronum ! 
Harry held his breath again : 
- Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto patronum ! 
- Did you try to concentrate on your happy memories ? 
- Yes ... yes ... 
Harry quickly forced all of his thoughts toward the first glider flight on the broomstick . 
He murmured : 
- Expecto patronum . 
Forgot , redo , expecto patronum ! 
Expecto patronum ! 
Something suddenly pops out of the wand's head , which looks like a turquoise silver . 
Harry asked nervously : 
- Do you see that ? 
Something new has happened ! 
Lupine smiled : 
- - Very good . 
Then right now ... are you ready to try against a Azkaban jailer ? 
Harry gripped his wand and said , 
- Teacher , ready . 
Harry stepped out in the middle of the empty classroom . 
He tries to keep his mind thinking of flying , but there is something that is not being invited , waiting for his head to shine ... now he hears it every day crying ... but it should not be thinking of it now 
Or is it just to hear the cry of the cheeks , even if it does not want to ... or deep inside it still want ... ? 
Lupine grabbed the lid of the cage and opened it . 
An Azkaban jailer slowly emerges from the cage , pointing his cloaked face toward Harry , his sparkly scarred hand clutching his lapel . The light in the classroom burns and then shut off . 
The bastard Azkaban stepped out of the cage and started quietly gliding at Harry , taking a deep breath to whistle . 
From him a terrible cold air covered Harry . 
Harry screamed : 
- Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto ... 
But both the class and the janitor Azkaban fainted , melting ... 
Harry once again fell into the thick white mist , and his cheek's voice cried out , more clearly than ever before , echoing in his head : 
- do not kill Harry ! do not kill Harry ! 
Please ... 
I will do anything . 
- - Stay away ... 
Get out , the other 
- Harry ! 
Harry woke up . 
He was lying on his back on the floor of the classroom . lights in the room were back lit . 
Harry did not need to ask what had happened . 
He sat up , feeling cold sweat , rolling down behind his glasses . 
It says small : 
- I'm sorry teacher . 
Lupine asked : 
- Are you okay ? 
Harry stood at the edge of the desk to stand up and immediately rely on it . 
- ... 
Lupine gave him a chocolate clone : 
- Here you eat , then we practice again . 
He never asked me to be successful the first time . 
Really , you will be surprised if you only do once that results immediately . 
Harry bites a piece of chocolate , muttering : 
- The worse and worse ... 
This time I can hear the baby voice better ... and his voice ... 
Voldemort ... 
Lupine look pale than usual : 
- Harry , if you do not want to continue , then you are not only sympathetic but also ... 
Harry stuffed the rest of the chocolate cloak in his mouth , saying drastically : 
- I do that again ! 
You have to do it ! 
But what if the bastards Azkaban again appeared in the match with the Ravenclaw team know how ? 
I can not let myself fall again . 
If we lose this match we lose hope for the Quidditch Cup ! 
Lupine said : 
- - That's fine ... 
Maybe you need to pick up another happy memory , I mean you need to focus on ... 
The happiness is not strong enough to fight ... 
Harry thought hard , and decided to choose when Gryffindor won the title of Home Champion last year when it was the happiest . 
Grabbing the wand again , Harry 
Put your position in the middle of the classroom . 
Lupine grabbed the lid of the cage , asking : 
- - Ready ? 
Harry replied , 
- Yes , ready . 
He tried to fill his mind with the cheerful ideas of Gryffindor's victory , not the gloomy thoughts of what was about to happen once the lid of the cage was opened . 
Lupine opened the cage , saying : 
- - Begin ! 
The room once again became cold and dark . 
Azkaban dashes forward , whistling , whistling toward Harry ... 
Harry screamed : 
- Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto pat ... 
White mist obscures all its senses ... 
Big , bulky figures moved around ... then a voice , a man's voice , screamed in panic ... 
- Lily , run Harry ! 
It's him ! scat ! Run ! 
I will hold his feet 
Someone's slipping into the room ... a door burst open ... laughter with high voices resounded on the client ... 
- Harry ! 
Harry ... wake up baby ... 
Lupine thumped Harry's face to wake him up . 
This time , it took Harry a moment to understand why it lay sprawled on the dusty classroom floor . 
He murmured : 
- I heard your children ! 
The first time I heard the voice of three children ... 
He risked his own battle with Voldemort to take his feet to run the baby cheeks ... 
Harry suddenly realized on his face there is tears tingle with sweat . 
He lowered his face to wipe his shirtless shirt , pretending to bend down to tie the shoelace , to let Lupine see . 
Lupine spoke in a very strange voice : 
- I heard English James ? 
Harry looked up at Lupine surprisedly : 
- ... 
Why do not you know my father ? 
Lupine said : 
- Yes ... Yes . 
In fact , he and his three children are classmates at Hogwarts . 
Harry , listen to me ... 
Maybe we should stop tonight's lesson here . 
The charm of the clan is to require high pressure . 
You should not have pushed yourself in this situation ... 
- - Are not ! 
Harry yelled . 
He sat up again . 
- I will practice again ! 
Maybe the memories I think are not fun enough to dread the fear ... so ... so wait a minute ... 
It fills the memory . 
A happy memory ... a happiness that can be used to transform into a strong guardian goddess ... 
It is the moment that it is first discovered that it is a witch and will 
Leaving the Dursleys to go to Hogwarts ! 
If it is not a happy memory then it is not really worth knowing what could make it happier ... 
She concentrated on her mood at the moment when she realized she was about to leave the house on Privet Drive , Harry stood up and turned again to the cage . 
Lupine acted as if he were doing something he did not want to do : 
- - Ready ? 
Focused so hard ? okay , get started ! 
He opened the cage for the third time , and the bastard Azkaban emerged from the cage , the room was dark and dark ... 
Harry screamed : 
- EXPECTO PATRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM ! 
Harry's screams begin to ring again ... 
But this time it sounded like it sounded from a broken radio . 
The cries grow smaller and smaller and smaller ... 
Harry could still see the Azkaban dictator ... he stood there ... and a huge white silvery shadow flashed from Harry's wand and ranged between Harry and the dad , And even though his legs were so watery , Harry was still standing ... but he did not know how long he would hold on . 
Professor Lupine rushed forward , growling : 
- Riddikulus ! 
A loud explosion resounds , the goddess of death by the clouds of Harry disappearing along with the guardian Azkaban . 
Harry sat down on a chair , feeling exhausted as he ran a mile , his legs trembling . 
Harry glanced at Professor Lupine , who was using his wand to send Mr. Kush back to the cage . 
Once again , Mr. Kook has turned into a silver ball . 
Lupine strode to where Harry was sitting , he said : 
- - Excellent ! 
That's good , Harry ! 
New to do that is so good baby ! 
- Can I practice again ? 
Again again . 
Lupine insisted : 
- - I can not right now . 
One night I learned that much enough . 
here ... 
He gave Harry a large chocolate dessert of the Duke's shop . 
- Eat all the children , not Mrs. Pomfrey again to reach the bone . 
Next week , too ? 
Harry replied , 
- Yes . 
He took a heavy chunk of chocolate and watched Lupine turn off the lights he had lit after the Azkaban diarist disappeared . 
An idea came to Harry's mind . 
It says : 
- Lupine teacher ? 
If you know the three , then you know Sirius Black too ? 
Lupine turned quickly , his voice sharp and hard to hear : 
- Why do you think that ? 
" Nothing at all ... I mean , I just knew that Sirius Black and his three children were friends at Hogwarts ... " 
Lupine's face seemed to relax . 
He said : 
- Oh , you know Black . 
Or at least I think you know . 
Late at night , you should leave this place , Harry . 
Harry left the classroom , walked down the corridor and across a wall , turned around a piece of metal armor and sat down at the foot of the pedestal , chewing it off the chocolate bar , blaming himself . I did not mention the name Black , because Lupine apparently did not like the subject very well . 
Then Harry thought back to his father and mother . 
It felt like it was dried up and empty , even though it was full of chocolate . 
It was horrible to hear the last moments of their chatter in his head , but it was the only time Harry had heard their voice , since it was tiny . 
He still wants to hear the voices of his parents again , so he will never be able to call up a proper Patron god ... 
He said to himself , 
- Your parents died . 
The parents died , even if they heard the sound of their parents can not make them live again . 
I have to control myself if I want to win the Quidditch Cup . 
Harry got up , swallowed the last piece of chocolate in his mouth and headed for Gryffindor . 
o 0 o 
A week after the second semester , Ravenclaw teams up with Slytherin . Slytherin won , although very narrow . 
According to Wood , this is good news for Gryffindor because if Gryffindor wins the Ravenclaw , it will be second . 
So Wood increased the number of home runs to five times a week . This meant that , despite Lupine's bachelor's degree in Azkaban ( which consumes more than six Quidditch sessions ) , Harry had only one evening of the week to do all this . my assignments . 
Even so , Harry was not as nervous as Hermione , her gigantic mass of exercises seemed to finally bump her shoulders . 
In the evening , without going anywhere , Hermione was always sitting in the corner of the common room , putting many tables together to wrap up the exercises , arithmetic , Rune , a map of the heavy lifting objects of the Muggle , and a heap of notebooks . 
She hardly talked to anyone , and anyone who bothered her learning was grumbled . 
One evening , as Harry was about to finish his hard - to - swallow dissertation on Snape's Unrecognizable Toxic , Ron said to him , 
- How can it do that ? 
Harry raised his head . 
Hermione almost hid behind a pile of tall books that just collapsed . 
Harry asked : 
- - Do what ? 
Said Ron : 
- Expected to be all classes of it ! 
This morning I heard him talk to Vector professor , mathematical witch . 
Two people talked about the lesson yesterday , but Hermione could not be in the math class , because she was in the same class at the same time as the Mystic Creature Caretaker . 
And Ernie McMillan told me that Hermione was not absent from any Muggle study session , but 
half of the lessons in that subject coincide with the time of the Prophet's study , which we find no lesson in the Prophet ! 
Now that Harry had no time to dig into the secret of Hermione's impossible timetable , it really needed to continue to finish the essay given by Mr. Snape . 
But just two seconds later his job was interrupted , this time by Wood . 
- Bad news , Harry . 
He had just come to McGonagall for his lightning bolt . 
I ... woke up with him . 
He said he had misplaced his priorities . 
As if you value the Quidditch trophy rather than worry about your survival . 
It is also because he told the old man that if he caught the Snitch before , he did not need to worry about the broom to throw him to the ground or not . 
Wood shook his head in disbelief : 
" To be honest , the kind of thing that bumps into his face ... makes me listen to what he thinks he's saying is terrible . " 
Then he asked her how she would keep the broom for so long ... 
Wood frowned and mumbled Professor McGonagall's grave voice : 
- In the time needed , Wood . 
Then he changed his voice , saying to Harry , 
" I think it's time to buy a new broom , Harry . " 
There is an order placed behind the Spirit Broom , you can buy a 2001 Nimbus broom , like Malfoy's broom . 
Harry bluntly : 
- I have no way to buy anything that Malfoy said is genuine . 
o 0 o 
January turns ambiguous in February , because there is no change in the cold weather . 
Gryffindor's match against Ravenclaw is on its way , but Harry has yet to order a new god broom . 
After every session , Harry went to McGonagall for information about Lightning . 
Ron was always close to Harry's hope , and Hermione hurried past them with her face turned away . 
When this scene came to the twelfth , Professor McGonagall said , before Harry could open his mouth : 
" Not yet , Harry , I can not get that broom yet . 
The teachers checked almost all of the usual crocus charms , but Professor Flitwick believed the broom could hide a charm . 
She will tell her as soon as the teachers check it out . 
Now please do not bother me anymore . 
The situation was even worse because Harry's Azkaban lessons were not as smooth as he expected . 
After many lessons , Harry is now able to create a silvery white shadow when Mr. Koo - duc Azkaban approaches him , but his guardian spirit is too fragile to scare him off . go to hell 
All that the Patronus could do was to be as lethargic as he could , exhausting Harry's power as he struggled to keep the Guardian spirit from dwelling there . 
Harry felt angry with himself , and felt guilty for still secretly longing to hear his mother's voice again . 
At the fourth training session , Professor Lupine said earnestly : 
- I ask you too much . For a thirteen - year - old witch can call up , even just looming , a guardian god is also said to be a great achievement . 
I'm not faint now , right ? 
Depressed Harry said : 
- I thought a guardian god would ... drove the Azkaban dementors away or did something ... make them disappear ... 
Professor Lupine said : 
- A genuine Guardian Guardian can do that . 
But you have also improved and gained a lot in a short time . 
If the Azkaban dreadlocks were to appear in your next Quidditch match , you would certainly have been able to keep them close , for a long time , enough to land safely on the ground . . 
Harry asked : 
- What do you say if they come to much more difficult ? 
Lupine smiled : 
- You have complete confidence in me . you deserve a drink . 
This dish bought from the shop Three Triumphs , sure before I have never been tasted ... 
He took two bottles from his bag . 
Harry blurted out without even thinking : 
- - Beer ! 
Yes , I love that dish very much ! 
Lupine raised one eyebrow . 
Harry licked his mouth : 
" Oh ... Ron with Hermione brought from Hogsmeade to give me a little bit of that . " 
" I understand , " said Lupine , even though he still looked at Harry with a brief glance . 
- Let's drink Gryffindor win over Ravenclaw ! 
But he added : 
- So it's not that the teacher is not on the side , because the teacher is not biased ... 
Two people drank butter in silence until Harry suddenly said something he had been wondering for a long time : 
- What's the secret of the demented captain of Azkaban ? 
Professor Lupine lowered the bottle with a thoughtful look : 
- Hmm ... 
Well , the only people who really know are those who are no longer able to tell us . 
You know , the Azkaban dreadlocks just lowered the hooded cap to cover their faces when they wanted to use their last weapon and also the worst weapon . 
- What is the teacher ? 
With a grim smile , Lupine said : 
" They call it the Kiss of the Dukes of Azkaban . That's what the Azkaban dictators do to those they want to destroy to the end . 
He assumed that under the hooded cap it would have something similar to his mouth , because the Azkaban dementors tied their mouths to the victim's mouth and drained the spirits of the bad guys . 
Harry choked a sip of butter . 
- - What ... ? 
They killed ... ? 
Lupine said , 
- - Oh no . 
Much worse than killing a lot . 
You know , once your brain and heart are still alive , you can still live without your soul . 
But people will no longer be aware of themselves , no longer memories ... nothing else . 
There is no chance of recovery . 
People just exist . 
Like a hollow shell 
And souls are permanently lost , forever lost . 
Lupine took another sip of avocado and continued : 
- that is the fate awaiting Sirius Black . 
The Daily Prophet has just posted this morning . 
The Ministry of Magic allowed the dictator Azkaban to do that once they caught Sirius Black . 
The idea of ​​ someone sucking his soul through the mouth made Harry sit awkward for a moment . 
But then he thought of Black . 
He suddenly said : 
- He deserves to be like that . 
Lupine asked softly , 
- Do you think so ? 
Do you really think someone is worth it ? 
Harry stubbornly said : 
- Yes , because ... because of the things ... 
Harry wants to tell Lupine the story of Black that he heard in the Three Brooms of the Spirit - the story of Black betrayed his parents . 
But to do so would lead to the loss of his escape to visit the unlicensed Hogsmeade , and Harry knew that Lupine would not be so impressed . 
So he finished his beer bottle , thanked Lupine , and left the Classroom of History of Magic . 
Harry had a slight regret thinking he was not going to ask what was covered under his head covered hat . 
The answer was horrible , and it was puzzled by the unsettled thoughts of how one would feel when one was so drained that it bumped into Professor McGonagall in the middle . stairs . 
- Look at where you are going , Potter ! 
- Yes , I'm sorry ... 
- She just went looking for her in the Gryffindor living room . 
Well , it's ... 
The teachers checked everything that teachers could think of and found nothing to be problematic . 
You have a very good friend , Potter . 
Harry's lower jaw dropped . 
Professor McGonagall is taking it lightning bolt , and the broom still looks as beautiful as it used to be . 
Harry said weakly : 
- Can you get it back ? 
Damn you ? 
Professor McGonagall said , she even smiled : 
- - It's true . 
You dare say you will need it to get used to it before the game on Saturday , right ? 
And Potter , try to win , to hear me baby ! 
Otherwise , we will be eliminated from the race because eight years have not won any trophy , just as Snape kindly reminded her last night ... 
Without a word , Harry took the broom up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower . 
At the corner of the wall , Harry saw Ron was running towards him , smile to his ears : 
- Grab your brushes for you , right ? 
Awesome ! 
Hey , listen , can I even try it ? 
Tomorrow ? 
For a whole month now I feel relieved , Harry says : 
- - OK whatever ... 
Do you know ? We should make peace with Hermione ... really he just wants to help ... 
Said Ron : 
- Oh , well ... now it's in the common room ... doing homework , to change that air . 
Turned down the hallway to Gryffindor Tower , Neville Longbottom pleaded with Mr. Cadogan . 
The knight did not seem to give Neville a chance . 
Neville shed tears , 
- I wrote to remember . 
But you must have fallen . 
Mr. Cadogan roared : 
- I heard too much ! 
Just then Cadogan sees Harry and Ron : 
- Welcome the cavalry of our gallantry . 
Hurry up here and grab this crazy guy locked in the iron knives , it insists on insider inside ! 
- Stop it ! 
Ron said as he and Harry went to Neville to stand side by side . 
Neville said to the two of them , 
- I lost my password ! 
I told him to tell me the password he would use this week , because he kept changing the password , now I do not remember what I did with that password anymore . 
Harry told Cadogan , 
- Oddsbodikins 
Mr. Cadogan was extremely frustrated and reluctantly swung to the front so they could get into the common room . 
Just a blink of the eye behind the room came a whisper as the heads whispered as all heads turned to look at the broom god on Harry's hand . 
People around Harry expressed admiration for the Lightning Rod : 
- Where is Harry going to be ? 
- Do you lend yourself a try ? 
- Have you ever been to Harry ? 
- This guy at Ravenclaw did not have a chance , they all just sat on Cleansweep 7 . 
- Can I hold it a bit ? 
In about ten minutes or so , lightning bolt was passed around and admired from all angles . 
Then the crowd dispersed and Ron and Harry could see Hermione the only one who did not rush towards them and kept doing the work , careful not to look into them . 
Finally , as Harry and Ron approached Hermione's table , she looked up . 
Harry raised his broom with a flash of lightning bolt to Hermione : 
- I got it back then ! 
Ron added : 
- Seeing the hips , Hermione ? 
It was not chisel charm . 
Hermione said : 
- Ờ ... 
But maybe it could be ! I mean , at least you know now that it's safe . 
Harry said : 
- Yes , that's right . 
Well , maybe I should take it upstairs ... 
Ron said enthusiastically , 
- let me take it away . Anyway , let's go to the Scabbers to take the Rat . 
Ron picked up the Lightning Rod and lifted it up like a crystal broom , then brought it up the stairs leading up to the boys ' bedroom . 
Harry asked Hermione , 
- Can you sit down here ? 
Hermione sneaked a pile of parchment from a chair , saying : 
- - It is OK . 
Harry looked around at the table full of books , peering from the long - drawn - out essay , to the Muggle - paper essay ( " Explain why Muggles need electricity " ) and then look up . The ancient Rune translation that Hermione was working on . 
Harry asked Hermione , 
- How did you do all that stuff ? 
Hermione said : 
- Ờ ... 
Well ... you know ... diligent work hard . 
Looking closer , Harry noticed that Hermione looked tired - looking like Lupine's tiredness . 
Harry looked at Hermione and opened up the books to find the Rune ancient dictionary . 
She asked : 
- Why do not you just drop a few ? 
Said Hermione , outraged : 
- I can not do that ! 
Harry took up a diagram of figures that looked very complicated : 
- Arrogance is too great . 
Said Hermione enthusiastically . 
- No , no , it's great . That is my favorite subject , it is ... 
But Harry never quite detected the greatness of Arithmetic , because right at that moment a chirp of cries echoed down from the stairs of the boys . 
The living room was suddenly silent , like the stone , glaring at the door . 
Then the footsteps rushed up loudly ... and then Ron jumped 
In front of everyone , hands pull the sheets . 
He strode to Hermione's table , screaming : 
- WHAT ! 
Ron shouted , hands folded sheets in front of Hermione : 
- WHAT ! 
- Ron , what's wrong ? 
- SCRABBERS ! WELCOME ! 
SCRABBERS ! 
Hermione fell over Ron , incredibly confused . 
Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding , something was measuring red on the mat . 
Something looks as horrible as ... 
- BLOOD ! 
Ron shouted in the quiet room . 
- It's so expensive ! AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE ROOM IS HERE ? 
Cried Hermione , 
- Kha ... 
he ... no ! 
Ron tossed something down on Hermione's ancient Rune translation . 
Hermione and Harry lean forward to see . 
Lying on the bizarre thorny shape is a long , colorful cat hair . 
Chapter 13 
GRYFFINDOR DREAM WITH RAVENCLAW 
It seems that this is the end of friendship between Hermione and Ron . 
This person is so angry that Harry can not know how they can reconcile . 
Ron was angry that Hermione did not even consider the Crookshanks to eat the mouse . Scrabbers were serious , not bothering to keep an eye on the cat , and to this day still try to do as well . The innocent Crookshanks , by asking Ron to go find the Scrabbers under all the beds of the boys . 
Meanwhile , Hermione argued that Ron had no evidence to accuse the Crookshanks who had eaten the Scrabbers , the feathered feathers that might have remained from Christmas until now , and that Ron had a bias against her cats since Crookshanks jumped down on Ron's head at the Mystic Fish Market . 
Particularly Harry , it is certain that Crookshanks has eaten the Scrabbers . 
But when Harry tried to prove to Hermione that all the evidence led to that conclusion , Hermione was mad at Harry . 
She squealed : 
" Okay , I know it's about Ron . 
Previously , it was Scrabbers , now it's my fault ! 
Please leave me alone , Harry , I have a lot to do ! 
Ron was very miserable about losing his mice . 
Fred said comfortingly : 
- Ron , do not you always complain that Scrabbers are bored ? 
And it has gone down for a long time , it's dying . 
Maybe it's so fast that it's better . 
Just a swallow ... maybe it does not feel anything . 
Ginny screamed out : 
- Fred ! 
George says : 
" It was you who said Ron , that it did not do anything but eat and sleep . " 
Ron said : 
- But it was because of us that bite Goyle . 
Remember , Harry ? 
Harry said : 
- Yes , that's right . 
Fred could not keep his face smiling : 
- that is the best time of his life . 
Let the scar on Goyle's finger become a permanent remembrance . 
And Ron , damn it , Ron , just leave me alone in the village of Hogsmeade to buy a new mouse . 
What's so sad about that ? 
In the final effort to make Ron excited , Harry coaxed it along to the last Quidditch session of the Gryffindor team before the match with Ravenclaw , so that after practice , Ron could ride the Thunderbolt . play . This seemed to make Ron forget the Scrabbers for a moment . ( " Who the heck ! 
I can try several shots on the broom . " So the two of them went out to play football together . 
Hooch , who was still overseeing Gryffindor's training to keep a watch on Harry , was equally impressed with the lightning bolt of the same light as any other . 
She looked at the broom and gave them some helpful advice before they could get up to exercise . 
- Look at the balance of it ! 
If the Nimbus broom has a defect , it is that they are slightly inclined towards the end of the broom ; Only after a few years will you see the brush being dragged . 
We also had a pair of broom handles : it was a bit slimmer than the Cleansweep broom , which reminded me of the old Silver Arrows broom , but now it is not produced . 
In the past I learned to fly on the broom Silver Nose , it is also a beautiful broom . 
She followed this flashback for a moment , until Wood said , 
- ... 
Miss Hooch , did Harry receive his Lightning Rod ? 
Not that we need to practice ... 
Ms . Hooch said : 
- Oh ... okay ... Hey , take this , Harry . 
I ' ll be sitting here with Ron ... 
Hooch and Ron left the arena to sit on the stage . 
The Gryffindor team gathered around Wood to hear his final injunction before the match tomorrow : 
" Harry , you found out who the new Ravenclaw Ranger was . That's Cho Chang . 
This girl is in the fourth year , very good ... 
Really , he just wanted her to not be able to play , she has some problems related to the wound ... 
Wood continued to grumble about how unhappy he was when Cho Chang had fully recovered , then he said : 
- On the other hand , that girl riding a Comet 260 , compared to the Lightning , is no different than a joke . 
Wood looked at Harry's brand - new broomstick with fervent admiration . 
Then he said : 
- Come on , all the attention : we start ... 
And lastly , Harry was climbing the Lightning , stepping on the ground to start 
motion . 
This broom is even better than its dream . 
Lightning bolts can be swiveled ; as if he knew Harry's thoughts , not just Harry's hand . 
Lightning flashed across the pitch at a speed that became a dark and blue object . 
Harry whipped the lightning bolt so badly that Alicia had to scream , then Harry dived down with a perfect control , his toes lightly touching the grass of the field before it again jumped up into the air . ten cubits high , thirteen cubits , and sixteen cubits . 
Wood calls : 
- Harry , I'm about to release Snitch ! 
Harry whirled around , racing with a bludger at the golfers ; It crossed the ball easily , and noticed the Snitch was popping out from behind Wood . 
Within ten seconds , Harry snatched the Snitch in his fist . 
The whole team cheered as madly mad as Harry . 
Harry dropped his Snitch , took it for a minute , then tear the air , wading between the other players in the team . 
Realizing that Snitch was crawling around Katie's knee , Harry flew around her and took the ball with ease . 
This is the best practice ever . 
Gryffindor's ball was in full swing , and when the team hit the ground , Wood did not have a word of mouth to say . This , as George remarks , is the first to be seen . 
Wood said : 
- You do not see anything that can hinder our victory tomorrow . 
Can not have anything , except ... 
Harry , I've settled my obsession with Azkaban daddy , right ? 
- Yes . 
Harry thought of his fragile Patronus , wishing it was a little stronger . 
Fred said confidently : 
- Dexter Azkaban can not re - appear where he Oliver , Dumbledore's boss has a frenzy up there and then nothing . 
Wood said : 
- So hopefully they will not come . 
Anyway , people practice well . 
Let's go back to Gryffindor Tower ... tomorrow morning ... 
Harry told Wood : 
- I stayed a little longer , Ron wanted to ride a lightning bolt . 
As the other members of the team walked toward the dressing room , Harry strode towards Ron . 
Ron crossed the fence with the stadium to run to Harry . 
Ms . Hooch was sitting down to sleep . 
Harry took the broomstick to Ron : 
- here you go riding ! 
With an ecstatic expression , Ron climbed up the broom and launched into the air , circling in the darkness that grew thicker as Harry walked around the field watching over him . 
When Hooch suddenly wakes up , the night is over . 
Harry and Ron did not wake up , insisting they had to return to the castle . 
Harry took the broom . The lightning bolt on Ron's shoulder came out of the darkened stadium . 
They talked about the hyper - smooth motion of the lightning rod , its extraordinary acceleration and its folding ability . 
They were halfway to the castle when Harry glanced to the left , seeing something that made his heart upside down : a pair of eyes , glittering from the darkness . 
Harry stood there , dead , his heart beating in his chest . 
Asked Ron : 
- - What's up ? 
Harry just . 
Ron pulled out his wand , murmuring : 
- Lumos ! 
A beam of light shone through the lawn , peering at a tree , lighting branches ; And , even hidden in the young leaves are Crookshanks ! 
Shouted Ron . 
- Quit now ! 
Ron bent down to pick up a stone on the lawn , but before it could do anything else , the cat wandered off the long , hungry tail that disappeared . 
Ron tossed the stone away , angrily said : 
- Seeing the hips ? 
She let it go wherever he wanted it ... maybe it was digesting Scrabbers and now dessert with some little birds ... 
Harry did not say anything . 
It took a deep breath when the fear was cleared and the feeling of reassurance was spreading all over . 
Harry had believed as a nail that it was Hung's eyes staring at it . 
The two went back to the castle . 
Harry was a little embarrassed about his panic so he did not say anything to Ron . 
Nor did he look to the left or to the right until he reached the brightly lit Hall of Fame . 
o 0 o 
The next morning Harry went down to eat breakfast with all the boys in the same dorm . 
All of them seem to think the Thunderbolt is worthy of such an honor . 
As Harry stepped into the Great Hall , how many heads turned toward the Lightning Torch , and the whistling screeched everywhere . 
Harry realized , with a hint of harshness , that the Slytherins were stunned by the lightning . 
Ron looked up at Malfoy and asked Harry , 
- Do you see the face of it ? 
It can not believe it ! 
That is all ! 
Wood also beamed under the halo of Lightning . 
- put it here Harry ! 
He placed the broom in the center of the table , carefully turning the broom's label to reveal it . 
Soon everyone from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables looked at each other . 
Cedric Diggory also came to congratulate Harry for a wonderful broomstick to replace the Nimbus tree , and Percy's friend Penelope Ravenclaw also came to ask if she could take the Lightning Broom by hand . or not ? 
While Penelope looked at Blazing Lightning , Percy eagerly said , 
- Okay , fine , Penny , do not have to sabotage it . 
Percy explained to the team : 
- Penelope and I fish together . 
Ten Galleons match results ! 
Penelope put down the Thunderbolt , thanks Harry and went back to the Ravenclaw table . 
Percy whispered urgently to Harry : 
" Harry , you must win ! " 
You do not have ten Galleons to share ! 
Hey , come here , Penny ! 
And he flipped to the side to eat with Penelope a piece of toast . 
A cold plastic voice rang out : 
- Are you sure you can ride the broom , Harry ? 
Draco Malfoy also came to look at the Lightning Broom , along with his two friends Crabbe and Goyle behind him . 
Said Harry , in a low voice . 
- Oh , aim is . 
Malfoy's gaze wickedly appeared : 
- Does it have many unique features ? Unfortunately it does not include umbrellas ... in case you approach an Azkaban jailer . 
Crabbe and Goyle giggle . 
Harry said : 
" And you , Malfoy , unfortunately have not attached a crooked arm to take Snitch for you . 
Gryffindor students burst out laughing . Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed , and he slid away . The Gryffindors looked at Malfoy about joining the Slytherins . 
They put their heads together , of course , to ask Malfoy if Harry's broomstick was actually a lightning bolt . 
At eleven o ' clock , Gryffindor started going to the dressing room . 
The weather compared to the time they played against Hufflepuff was really a difference . 
Today is cool , clear , slightly windy . 
This can not have the vision 
Restricted , and Harry in spite of the tension , began to feel the excitement that only a Quidditch match could give him . 
They could hear the whole school pulling together to the stadium . 
Harry took off his black school uniform and pulled his wand out of his pocket and stuffed it inside the T - shirt he wore under his Quidditch uniform shirt . 
It was hoped it would not have to use the wand in this battle . 
And it suddenly wondered whether Professor Lupine was in the crowd to observe it . 
When they were about to leave the dressing room , Wood said , 
- You know what we have to do . 
If we lose this match , we will be eliminated from the race . 
Just ... just fly as we train yesterday as we will win ! 
They went into the field between applause . Ravenclaw in blue was standing in the middle of the field . 
Their henchmen are Cho Chang , the only female player in Ravenclaw . 
She was a little lower than Harry , and although Harry was extremely tense , he could not help but notice that she was extremely beautiful . 
When the two teams were facing each other behind their captain , she smiled at Harry , and Harry felt a slight throb somewhere in his stomach that he was not at all worried about . 
Ms . Hooch said quickly : 
- Wood , Davies , shake hands . 
Wood shakes hands with Ravenclaw . 
- Climb up the broom ... wait for my whistle ... 
father ... 
two ... 
one ... 
Harry jumped up into the air and the Lightning Rod blew up higher and higher faster than any other broom . 
Harry lunged around the stadium and squinted for Snitch , listening to all the comments of Lee Jordan's best friend Fred and George . 
- The players have already flown up , and the great excitement of the game is the lightning bolt that Harry Potter is riding to play for Gryffindor . 
According to the Guide to the Spirit , Lightning will be the god of choice for the national team at the World Championship Quidditch this year ... 
Professor McGonagall's voice interrupted : 
- Jordan , please tell us what's going on in the game ! 
- Yes , obey the professor ... just provide a background information only . 
By the way , the lightning bolts are automatically designed in the interior and ... 
- Jordan ! 
- Gryffindor , Gryffindor's Katie Bell is aiming for the goal ... 
Harry crossed Katie's face in the opposite direction , looking intently around for a glint of golden ball . 
He noticed that Cho Chang was close to his tail . 
Certainly this girl flew very well , crossing Harry's flight path , forcing Harry to change course . 
Fred shouted as he sped through Harry to pursue the Blugger attacking Alicia : 
- Let her see the lightning speed of Harry ! 
Harry threw the Thunderbolt ahead of it flying around some of Ravenclaw's postcards , causing Cho Chang to fall behind . 
As soon as Katie threw the first goal and the Gryffindor at the bottom of the field was happy as crazy as Harry saw it : the Snitch was close to the ground , gently hovering over a fence . 
Harry fell down . 
Cho Chang saw what Harry was doing , followed immediately . 
Harry's speed increased , his blood boiling in suspense , falling down this type of Harry's specialty . 
It is only three meters from the ground . 
Suddenly a Bludger was slamming a Ravenclaw player for a punch , and Harry had to twist , deflecting to dodge the Bludger in his hairline ; And in just a few seconds , Snitch disappears . 
The fans of Gryffindor rang out in frustration , but from the crowd of Ravenclaw fans , they clapped their fierce applause . 
George fights his anger by punching a second Bludger directly at the opponent's opponent , causing the other to flick his cat in the air to dodge . 
- - Gryffindor are leading 80 - 0 , and take a look at the Thunderbolt ! 
Now Harry has really taken advantage of Lightning . 
Look at it change direction ... 
Chang's comet can not be considered as its opponent . 
Its correct balance is noticeable in the ... 
- JORDAN ! CHILD HAS BEEN ADVERTISED TO THE HEART OF THE JELLY ? HOW TO CONTINUE COMMENT ? 
Ravenclaw were back in defense , scoring just three more , leaving Gryffindor only fifty points ahead . 
If Cho catch Snitch before Harry then Ravenclaw will win . 
Harry lowered further , dodging the Ravenclaw Player's narrow gaze , glancing across the court to search for the crazy Snitch . 
A glistening yellow glitter , a grip of gold wings ... 
The Snitch is hovering over Gryffindor's post . 
Harry sped up , his eyes fixed on the gold in front of him ... but only a second later , Cho appeared , not knowing anything in the air , in Harry's direction . 
Wood roared : 
- HARRY ! THIS IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE ! LET's GET OUT OF THIS IF YOU NEED TO DO ! 
Harry flew away to avoid collision . 
She turned her head to see Cho's eyes , smiling with laughter . 
Snitch again disappeared . 
Harry whipped the Lightning Rod upwards and jumped higher than the spot where the match took place to seven meters . 
He glances at Cho after he still follows ... 
This girl decided to follow Harry instead of hunting Snitch . 
Well , if she wanted to follow Harry , then she had to take the consequences . 
Harry collapsed again , and Cho , thought Harry had discovered the Snitch , followed him closely . is going down , Harry suddenly jumped upward , and her little girl to follow the momentum down . 
Once again Harry shot up as fast as a bullet , and then Harry saw it a third time : the Snitch ball was fluttering at the edge of the Ravenclaw field . 
Harry sped up , and beneath it several yards , Cho also accelerated . 
Harry is about to win , about to win the Snitch in a half again . 
Suddenly ... 
- Oh ! 
Exclaimed , pointing down at the grass . 
Harry was given the dominant mind , also looked down . 
Three Azkaban dictators , three black Azkaban guards , a hooded hat , looked up at Harry . 
Harry did not stop to think . 
Throwing a hand over the collar of his robes , he drew out the wand and roared : 
- Expecto patronum ! 
Something silver - white , something huge , burst out from the wand's head . 
Harry knew his guardian was on the Azkaban dreadlocks , but he did not stop for a moment to see the result , his mind still mysteriously awake , looking straight ahead ... and it was about to hit . come on 
She reaches out her hand and grabs her wand and just closes her fingers around the tiny Snitch that is struggling . 
Hooch's whistle sounded . 
Harry returned in the air and saw six purple shadows lunging at him . 
Immediately afterwards , Harry was hugged by the Gryffindor squad , so intense , so warmly kissed that he was nearly pulled out of his god broom . 
Down below , he heard the cheers of the Gryffindor crowd in the crowd . 
Wood still shouted : 
- male worthy 
Alicia , Angelina , and Katie whipped Harry , and Fred was so tight that Harry felt like his head was about to fall off . 
In the chaos , the team also found a way back to the ground . 
Harry climbed down the broomstick and looked up to see a forest of Gryffindor fans running low across the pitch , led by Ron . 
Before it reacted , it was submerged under the cheers of the crowd . 
Ron pulled Harry's arm up to the sky and shouted : 
- Don ! 
Ca ! Ca ! 
Percy was happy : 
- Well , Harry ! 
Ten Galleons belong to him ! 
You have to find Penelope ! 
Sorry ... 
Seamus Finnigan also roared : 
- Excellent , Harry ! 
Hagrid appeared , covering the smiling Gryffindor : 
- Excellent speech ! 
Suddenly a voice in Harry's ear : 
- That is the guardian god . 
Harry turned around and saw Professor Lupine , who looked both trembling and satisfied . 
Harry fervently said : 
- Dementors Azkaban has nothing to do with the baby ! 
I do not feel anything at all ! 
The professor said : 
- Because they are ... 
Oh ... they are not Azkaban dementors . 
I came to see ... 
He led Harry away from the crowd until they saw the edge of the arena . 
Lupine said : 
- I made Malfoy a frightened soul ! 
Harry's eyes widened . 
On the pitch were a bunch of coyotes : Malfoy , Crabbe , Goyle and Marcus Flints , the Slytherin Quidditch captain , struggling to shed their long black hooded sweatshirts and hooded hoods . 
It looks like Goyle has been working on the Malfoy Channel on his shoulder to imitate a tall Azkaban dictator . Standing on top of the Malfoys , Professor McGonagall , with a face expressing a terrible anger . 
She shouted : 
- A despicable joke ! 
A cowardly and despicable attempt to assassin Gryffindor's Gryffindor ! 
Fine to ban all the games , and minus the Slytherin fifty points ! 
I will present this to Professor Dumledore , without any confusion ! 
Ah , it's coming ! 
If you can seal a victory for Gryffindor , then this is it . 
Ron squeezed his way to the side of Harry , laughing twice as he watched Malfoy struggling to get out of his camouflage , while Goyle's head was still stuck in the flush . 
George pushed the crowd to Harry's side : 
- Come on , Harry ! 
Open the Banquet ! 
Go back to the Gryffindor living room ! 
Harry felt happier than ever : 
- that's right ! 
He and the other players in the Gryffindor team pulled together , still wore purple robes , left the stadium and returned to the castle . 
o 0 o 
As if they had won the Quidditch trophy , the Gryffindors had extended the party from morning until late . 
Fred and George disappeared for hours , then came up with a bottle of beer , a beverage , and lots of candy . 
When George started to munch the mints to the crowd , Angelina Johnson squealed : 
- How do you do that ? 
Fred whispered in Harry's ear : 
- thanks to a little help of Dream , Silly , Wormtail , Stuffed Feet and Gau Nai . 
Only one person does not participate in this fun . 
Hermione was unbelieving , still sitting in a corner of the room , trying to read a great book called The Living Life of the Family and the Muggle Anglophone Society . 
Harry left the table where George and Fred started juggling a few beers , going to Hermione . 
He asked her : 
- Do not you go watch the game ? 
Hermione did not look up , answering in a high - pitched voice that sounded strange : 
- of course I have to go . 
And I'm glad we won , and I think you're a good player , but I need to finish reading this book on Monday . 
Harry looked at Ron , wondering if Ron was high enough to get rid of the hysterics . 
Harry said : 
- Hermione , come here and eat something . 
Said Hermione , sounding slightly agitated : 
- I can not , Harry . 
I have four hundred twenty - two pages to read . 
With the ... 
Hermione glanced at Ron . 
- - he did not want me to participate . 
This is not the argument , because Ron chose this time to say Clarion : 
- If the Scrabbers are not bitten , they can enjoy this bubble gum fly ; In the past it enjoyed this dish very much ... 
Cried Hermione . 
Without waiting for Harry to say or do anything , she folded the great book , clamped her way , and sobbed as she ran upstairs to the girls ' room , and disappeared . 
Harry asked Ron , " Can not you forgive Hermione ? " 
Ron answered bluntly , " No . 
I would rather be sorry . 
But he still refuses to admit that he is wrong . 
Hermione acted as if the Scrabbers were on holiday or something . " 
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall appeared in his robes and nets at one o ' clock in the morning , to emphasize that all the children had to sleep . 
Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their bedroom , still commenting on the match . 
Finally , too tired , Harry crawled into bed , pulling four curtains to cover the place to cover the moonlight shining . 
She lay back , and immediately felt sleepy . 
He dreamed a strange dream . 
He was walking through a forest , holding a lightning bolt on his shoulder , followed by something silvery white . 
The silver and white color snaked through the woods in front of him , and Harry could only see it glimpses through the leaves . 
Worried about that , Harry stepped faster , but the faster he stepped up , the faster the shadow in front of him . 
Harry ran forward , with the horse's beard faster and faster . 
Now it runs at full speed and it hears in front of it the galloping gallop . 
Then he turned to the corner of a forest , saw an empty field and ... 
- AAAAAAAAAAA ! D ! 
Harry woke up as if he had just been punched in the face . 
Wild in the darkness , he fumbled the curtains around the bed . 
He could hear the noise of the people around him , and then Seamus's voice rang from the other end of the bedroom : 
- - What happened ? 
Harry thought it sounded like the door of the bedroom was falling . 
Finally , finding the curtain , Harry pointed out and at the same time saw Seamus lighting the lamp . 
Ron was sitting on the bed , a torn veil hanging from one side of his bed , his face frightening in horror . 
- Black ! 
Sirius Black ! 
He has a knife ! 
- - What ? 
- - Here ! 
Immediately ! 
Ruined the curtain ! wake up ! 
- You sure you do not dream , Ron ? 
- Look at the screen ! 
I told you that he was here ! 
They all jumped out of bed together . 
Harry ran to the bedroom door first , and they jumped off the stairs . 
The door to the other bedroom opened behind them and the sleepy voice asked : 
- Who yells it ? 
- What are you doing now ? 
The common room is lit only by the decaying flames in the fireplace , showing the scars of trash and the remnants of the party . 
In addition , the room is completely empty : 
- You sure you are not dreaming , Ron ? 
- I told you that I saw him . 
- What is so noisy ? 
- Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed ! 
Some girls went down the stairs , wearing their nightgowns and yawning . 
Boys also appear . 
Fred asked anxiously : 
- - Very good ! 
We play again ! 
But Percy rushed into the living room , just laying the Badge of the Male Leader on his nightgown , saying , 
- Everyone upstairs ! 
Said Ron weakly : 
- Percy ... 
Sirius Black ! 
He's in our bedroom ! 
He has a knife ! 
He wakes me up ! 
The living room suddenly fell silent . 
Percy looks startled : 
- LOL ! 
Probably you eat so much Ron ... get a nightmare ... 
- I told you is ... 
- Well , you say enough is enough ! 
Professor McGonagall is back . 
She slammed the portrait behind her back into the living room and looked around her anger : 
- I'm glad Gryffindor won the match , but this is ridiculous ! 
Percy , I expected more games ! 
Percy straightened up angrily and said , 
" I certainly do not allow this . 
I just told them to go to bed ! 
My brother has a nightmare ... 
But Ron screamed : 
- NOT THE EIGHT ! LOVE , SICK AND BLACK SIRIUS WIDE BABY BABY , BABY BABY ! 
Professor looks at Ron : 
- Do not talk bullshit , Ron . 
How can he pass the portrait hole ? 
Ron shook his trembling fingers toward the back of the painting . Mr. Cadogan : 
- Ask him ! 
Asked if he saw ... 
Professor McGonagall looked at Ron suspiciously , selling her suspicions , then she pushed open the portrait and went outside . 
All the living room listening to : 
- Mr. Cadogan , did you just let a man go to Gryffindor Tower ? 
Mr. Cadogan exclaimed : 
- yes , ladies and gentlemen ! 
Inside and outside the living room were silent . 
Professor McGonagall's voice resounded : 
- You ... did you put it in ? 
But ... but the password ? 
Mr. Cadogan said proudly : 
- He has a password . 
He has his password all week , ladies . 
He reads the wall from a piece of paper ! 
Professor McGongall crossed the portrait hole to face the still stunned pupils . 
She looked as white as lime . 
Her voice trembled : 
- Who the most stupid person wrote the password this week and let the paper fly around ? 
The choking silence is broken by a screeching hiss . 
And Neville Longbottom , shivering from head to toes with cotton slippers , slowly raised his hand . 
Chapter 14 
THE SNAPE's FEATURE 
That night no one in Gryffindor Tower could sleep . 
They knew the castle was being ransacked again , and the Gryffindor house was awake in the common room , waiting to hear if Black was arrested . 
Day after day , Professor McGonagall returned to tell them that Black had escaped again . 
The next day , they went to a place in the castle and found a tight security sign . 
Professor Flitwick is teaching the giant doors a picture of Sirius Black . 
Filch's supervisor suddenly stormed down the corridors , sealing everything from crevices on the wall to the hole . 
Mr. Cadogan was fired . 
His picture was taken in a remote corner on the seventh floor , and Mrs. Beo returned to his former position . 
Her portrait has been revitalized in great skill , but she is still extremely tense , and only accepts return to work as long as there is more protection for her . 
One has to hire a ridiculous dwarf devil to protect . 
The demons walked around each group in a manner of intimidation , talking to each other with their grunts , and arguing with each other about the bigger one . 
Harry could not help but notice that the witch - eye wall on the third floor remained unlocked and unprotected . 
It seems that George and Fred are right to assume that there are only two of them , and now Harry , Ron and Hermione , are the rare ones who know the secret passage hidden inside the statue . 
Harry asked Ron : 
- Do you think we should tell anyone ? 
Ron replied : 
" We know he can not go through the secretary's shop . " 
We did not hear about the hacking of the Secret Duty Store ! 
Harry is also glad Ron sees things from this point of view . 
If the witch had one eye closed , he would have no chance of going to Hogsmeade . 
Ron suddenly became a celebrity . 
For the first time in his life , people were paying more attention to it than paying attention to Harry , and it was obvious Ron was enjoying this experience . 
Although still very touched about the event that night , Ron happily told anyone to inquire about what had happened , including a whole bunch of details : 
- ... I was sleeping , and I heard the sound of something being torn apart , I thought I was dreaming , understand ? 
But then a gust of wind ... I woke up and saw the bed curtain I was tugged down ... I roll over ... and I see him standing by my bed ... looks like a skeleton way with a tangled ear ... holding a long knife , probably three inches ... and he looked at me , I looked at him , and then I screamed , so he escaped straight . 
When the second - year - old girls listened to Ron's story and pulled together , Ron turned to Harry : 
- - Why ? 
Why did he leave ? 
Harry also wondered that . 
Why did Black , after the wrong bed , stop gagging Ron and continue to pay Harry ? 
Twelve years ago , Black has shown he is not afraid of killing innocent people , but this time facing five unarmed boys , four of them are asleep , so he must be dragged . To 
Harry deduces : 
" He probably knew he was going to have a hard time coming back out of the castle when he screamed and woke everyone up . 
At that time he would have to kill everyone in this house to get out the port portrait ... and then confronted the teacher ... 
Neville sa very humiliating situation . 
Professor McGonagall was so angry that he was forbidden to visit Hogsmeade from now on . 
She also ban it and prohibits anyone to tell it the password Gryffindor . 
Poor Neville was trapped outside the common room every evening , waiting for someone to give it to him , while the dwarves guarding him went up and down and stared at him in discomfort . 
However , none of these penalties were comparable to what her grandmother made available to him . 
Two days after the Black Invasion , Neville's grandmother sent him the most horrible letter that Hogwarts students could receive at breakfast - a Thunder Letter . 
The Hogwarts owls rushed into the Hall , carrying letters as usual , and Neville held his breath as he saw a big garden owl lopping down in front of him with a purple envelope in his mouth . 
Harry and Ron were sitting face to face with Neville immediately recognizing the letter as a Thunder Letter - Ron had received such a letter from his mother last year . 
Ron advises Neville : 
- Take it to Neville . 
Neville did not wait for the second time . 
He took the letter and held it up as if holding a bomb , it ran out of the Hall , while the Slytherins burst into laughter at Neville's expression . 
Everyone listened to the Thunder letter in the Hall - Neville's grandmother's voice was magically magnified , a hundred times louder than usual , hissing at how high Neville could bring the whole family . such a humiliation ! 
Harry was so upset that Neville was so unaware that he had a letter . 
Hedwig took a pang on his wrist to note . 
Harry exclaimed : 
- - Ouch ! 
Thanks ... Thank you Hedwig . 
Harry tore the letter out while Hedwig himself served it with Neville's cereal . 
The letter to Harry wrote : 
Dear Harry and Ron , Would you like to have tea with me about six o ' clock this afternoon ? 
You will go to the castle to welcome the children . LET's TALK IN THE MONEY , THE BOYS ARE NOT FORGOTTEN OUT OF ONE ! 
Cheer up ! 
Uncle Hagrid . 
Said Ron : 
- Perhaps Hagrid wants to hear all about Black ! 
So around six o ' clock , Harry and Ron left the Gryffindor common room , ran through the protective dwarfs , and went down to the lobby . 
Hagrid was waiting there . 
Said Ron : 
- Hagrid , how good ! 
Did you want to hear what happened on Saturday ? 
Hagrid opened the front door leading the two young children out : 
- You have heard all the talk about it . 
- - Really ? 
Ron looked a bit exhausted . 
When he stepped into Hagrid's hut , what the two kids first saw was Buckbeak . 
He was sprawled on Hagrid's patchwork blanket , his cushioned wings folded around him , and he was enjoying a large dish of ferrets . 
Looking at the other side of the room , Harry saw the great brown feathered cap and the terrible yellow and orange tie hung on the door of his wardrobe . Hagrid . 
Harry asked : 
- What is the suitcase for Hagrid ? 
Said Hagrid . 
- Buckbeak's case against the Dangerous Goods Commission is due to go on trial this Friday . 
He had to go to London together . 
Uncle ordered two tickets on the bus Knight ... 
Harry felt a crush on guilt . 
It almost forgot that the Buckbeak case was close by , and based on Ron's miserable face , he knew Ron was probably feeling it . 
They forgot that promise to help Hagrid prepare to defend Buckbeak ; The lightning bolt cleared the Buckbeak case from their heads . 
Hagrid poured tea and offered them a plate of bread , but they knew that it was best not to eat ; They had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking skills . 
Sit yourself between two children . 
Hagrid looked serious in a way that did not fit his personality well . 
- Uncle has something to discuss with two grandchildren . 
Harry asked : 
- what's wrong ? 
Said Hagrid . 
- Hermione . 
Asked Ron : 
- Hermione , what's wrong with us ? 
- That girl is right , that's what I want to say . 
From Christmas to the time she often came down to see her doctor , it is very lonely . 
Initially , because of the lightning bolt that the two little children do not talk to it , then do not talk to it just because of the cat ... 
Angry Ron interrupted : 
- ... years of losing children Scabbers ! 
Hagrid continued stubbornly . 
- Because Hermione's cat acts like every other cat . 
He cried many times , you know ? 
Now it is going through a very difficult period . 
If you ask me to tell you , Hermione has so many subjects , with so many exercises it tries to do , it still makes time to help the Buckbeak son ... 
It is very useful material for him ... said that now he will have many chances to win ... 
Harry confused open his mouth : 
- Uncle Hagrid ... 
We should also help you ... we apologize to you ... 
Hagrid flicked Harry's apologies aside : 
- You do not blame me for that . 
God knows I have enough to deal with . 
He watched me practicing Quidditch each and every night . 
But I have to tell you that I think you two should respect a friend more than brooms and mice . 
You said that much . 
Harry and Ron miserably looked at each other . 
Hagrid continued : 
" When Black nearly stabs me , Ron , Hermione is very unhappy . 
He knew where his heart was , and the two of them did not even talk to him now . 
Ron said , 
" If Hermione gave up the cat , she would talk to her again . 
But she insisted on it ! 
It was a crazy cat , and she would not listen to a cat . 
- Ờ ... 
... people may be a bit stupid about their pets . 
Hagrid sounded smart . 
But behind him Buckbeak was pouring some mink bone on his pillow . 
The three of us spent the last part of our visit to comment on the added opportunity of Gryffindor in the Quidditch Cup . 
At nine o ' clock , Hagrid took the two children back to the castle . 
When they reached the living room , the crowds gathered around the bulletin board . 
Ron pressed his neck over the others to read the new announcement and shouted , 
- Visit Hogsmeade Village next week ! 
When we sat down , Ron asked Harry : 
- What are you doing ? 
Said Harry , voice even smaller : 
- Ờ ... Filch did not do anything to lead the Duke ... 
that ... 
- Harry ! 
A voice echoed in his ear . 
Harry looked up at Hermione . 
She was sitting at the table behind the two of them and was cleaning up a pile of books that had apparently obscured her . 
Hermione said : 
" Harry , if you go to Hogsmeade again ... I ' ll tell Miss McGonagall about the map ! " 
Ron did not look at Hermione , 
- Harry , do you hear anybody saying that ? 
- Ron , how can you ask Harry to go with you ? 
After what Sirius Black nearly made up for . 
I say that , I will tell you ... 
Ron is crazy : 
- So now you're trying to get Harry out of school ! 
This school year has not caused enough disaster for others or why ? 
Hermione opened her mouth to answer , but a hiss came and Crookshanks rushed to her lap . 
She hurries Crookshanks hastily to go to the girl's bedroom . 
Ron turned back to Harry as if the story was not Hermione crossed : 
- How about that ? Go ahead , you did not go to see anything before . 
You're not in Zonko's Supermarket yet ! 
Harry looked around to see if Hermione was out of earshot . 
It says : 
- - go . 
But this time I will bring with me a T - shirt . 
On Saturday morning , Harry wrapped the Invisibility T - shirt in his pocket , tucked the Map of the hackers into his pocket and went down to eat breakfast with everyone . 
Hermione looked at Harry suspiciously at the bottom of the table , but Harry avoided her eyes and carefully let her see it back up the marble stairs to return to the Hall . Walk towards the main gate . 
Harry waved to Ron : 
- - Goodbye ! 
See you when you return home ! 
Ron grinned and winked . 
Harry hurried up to the third floor , just as he was walking out the map of the hackers . 
Behind the statue of the witch one eye , Harry straightened the map . 
A tiny dot is moving toward it . 
Harry squinted at the dot . 
The tiny letter that followed the little dot clearly marked " Neville Longbottom " . 
Harry hurriedly pulled out the wand , murmuring : 
- Dissendium ! 
... and threw his briefcase into the statue , but before it could climb in , Neville went to the corner of the corridor . 
- Harry ! 
I forget that you can not go to Hogsmeade ! 
Harry walked away from the statue and tucked the map back into his pocket . 
- Hi Neville ! 
Now what do you do ? 
Neville shrugged . 
- - Do nothing ! 
Do you want to play the game ? 
- Eh ... now I do not ... I'm going to the library and do a vampire essay for Lupine . 
Neville's eyebrows radiate : 
- So I will go with you ! 
I have not done that yet . 
- Oh ... I was drunk ... Oh yeah , I forgot to spend it , I finished it last night . 
Neville's round face seemed anxious : 
- Excellent ! 
You help me with listening ! 
I do not understand a little about the garlic ... do not know they have to eat or ... 
Neville dropped his mouth , gaping over Harry's shoulder . 
He saw Snape . 
Neville ran to hide behind Harry . 
Snape's teacher approached and stopped , looking from one to the other . 
- Two games in this place ? 
Choose an odd place to date ... 
With Harry's anxiety overshadowed , Snape turned his dark eyes toward the doors at the two corridors , and then he looked up at the statue of the witch's eye . 
Harry stammered : 
" We do not have a date here . 
We ... 
just ... meet here . 
Snape said , 
- - Really ? 
You have a habit of hanging around in the most unexpected places , Potter , which rarely appears in those places without reason ... 
I think the two should return to Gryffindor Tower right , that is the place of the game . 
Harry and Neville hurried away without a word . 
As he turned the corner , Harry looked back . 
He saw Snape , who was holding a hand on the witch's eye , scrutinized it carefully . 
Harry tries to break free from Neville's hole in her portrays by revealing his password , pretending to have forgotten his vampire essay in the library , having returned . 
Harry ducked out of the dwarves ' security guards , pulling the map out again , closing his nose . 
The third floor lobby seems silent . 
Harry carefully scanned the map and found the dot on his name tag " Severus Snape " was now in his office . 
She breathed a sigh of relief . 
Harry ran back to the witch's eyes , lifted the hump on her back , swung up and went inside , touching her briefcase at the end of the rock slider inside the statue . 
He reads the mantra for the empty map as before and then runs . 
o 0 o 
Completely hidden under the invisibility cloak , Harry stepped out in the sun outside the Duke's shop and poked Ron . 
He whispered : 
- I'm here ! 
Ron whistled : 
- How long do you shake ? 
- - Snape's going around ... 
You two pull up the big road . 
Ron kept saying through his mouth : 
- Where are you ? 
Are you still there 
This feeling is ... 
The two went to the post office ; Ron pretended to pay a visit to Egypt for Bill , so that Harry could spend the night looking around . 
The owls hovered on the ground and snuggled up , at least three hundred ; From the Great Gray to the Little Wildcat ( these are only locally transmitted ) , the little ones are so small that they can fit into Harry's palm . 
Then two of us in the Zonko Kidnapping room was filled with students , Harry must be very careful not to step on their feet lest they panic . 
In the shop there are enough turntables and surreal games to fascinate even the super stir like Fred and George . 
Harry whispered in his ear . Ron said he bought one or the other and gave him some gold under the Invisibility Cloak . 
When they left the Zonko Entertainment store , their bags were slightly lighter than when they first came in , but their pockets were filled with bombs , stingy candy , tadpole soap , and each one . cup of tea drinking nose 
The weather was nice , the wind was cold , the two of them did not want to go in the shops , so they went through the Three Broom Shop , climbed a slope to visit the tent , where many haunted . England . 
It is on the high side , slightly separated from the village by a road , and although it is in the middle of the day , the house looks slightly murky , with its wooden windows locked up in a dense , dense garden . 
As the two looked up , Harry said , 
- Even Hogwarts ghosts away from there . 
I used to ask Nick - Nearly - lost head ... he said he did not hear as there is a very aggressive crowd in it . 
There is no one who can not be . 
Brother George with Fred apparently tried to break in , but all the entrances were closed , sealed ... 
Harry felt heated after climbing , considering whether to take off the T - shirt for a while or not , then hear the voices nearby . 
Someone is climbing up the steep hill toward the house . 
A moment later , Malfoy appeared , followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle . 
Malfoy was saying loudly : 
- ... this should have been my father's shot . 
He went to court to file a lawsuit over my arm ... that I could not use my arm for three months ... 
Crabbe and Goyle giggle . 
" I do not think I can hear that big , dumb guy , and that hair is justified . " " It's not ... dangerous , really , " the Seahawk was like dead . ... 
Suddenly Malfoy saw Ron . 
Its pale face gave off a venomous smile : 
" What are you doing , Weasley ? " 
Malfoy looked at the ruined house behind Ron : 
" You probably live here , are not you , Weasley ? " 
Surely dreaming of having a private bedroom ? 
I heard that you both slept together in a room , right ? 
Harry grabbed Ron's back to prevent him from dancing to Malfoy . 
He said in his ear Ron : 
- let him for me . 
This golden opportunity can not be ignored . 
Harry crawled around behind Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , bending down to mud off the side of the road . 
Malfoy raised his voice to Ron : 
- We just talked about your old friend Hagrid . 
Just imagine what he said to the Committee for the Elimination of Dangerous Animals . 
Do you think he was crying hu hu not , when the code is cut off the neck ... 
- BUT ! 
Malfoy ducked in before his lumps landed in his head , his blond hair suddenly muddy . 
- - What ... ? 
Ron had to cling to the fence to try to stand , not roll back out of laughter . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle goofing around , glaring around , Malfoy struggling to muddy his hair . 
- - What is this ? Who do ? 
With the indifference of a weather commentator , Ron said : 
- That house has a lot of ghosts , right ? 
Crabbe and Goyle seemed to panic , their raised muscles were not playing with ghosts . 
Malfoy stared at the deserted surroundings . 
Harry crept along the path , to a puddle of muddy blue water . 
BOX ! 
BOX ! BOX ! 
Crabbe and Goyle were hit . 
Goyle angrily jumped on the spot , trying to wipe the sewer from his languid eyes . 
Malfoy wiped his face and stared at Harry two yards to the left . 
It says : 
- It comes from that place ! 
Crabbe rushed forward , his long arms extended , as if he were a demon . 
Harry fumbled around Crabbe , picked up a stick , whipped Crabbe in the tail . 
Harry folded his back to laugh . 
Crabbe turned around to see who was the culprit . 
Because only the only one was Ron , Crabbe headed for Ron to retaliate , but Harry had stomped on his feet and made him fall craggy . 
And when Crabbe was about to roll , his father's leg was tangled in Harry's lap . 
The shirt was strong and Harry felt it slip away from his face . 
In an instant , Malfoy glared at Harry . 
Then he pointed at Harry's head , shouting : 
- AAAAAAAA ! 
and it turns back , and pours it on his neck , and runs like a mad man down the hill ; Crabbe and Goyle clung to it . 
Harry covers the Invisibility Cloak , but the damage has already occurred . 
Ron fumbled , staring helplessly at where Harry had just disappeared : 
- Harry ! 
You just ran away ! 
If Malfoy told anyone else ... well then you should run to the castle , hurry up ... 
- Then see you later . 
Without saying a word , Harry ran back down the road back to Hogsmeade . 
Does Malfoy believe in what he sees ? 
Does anyone believe in Malfoy ? No one knows about the Invisibility Cloak - no one except Dumbledore . 
Harry's liver swings upside down - Dumbledore will definitely know what happened , if Malfoy reveals anything ... 
Run to the Secret Duty shop , run down the stairs leading down to the storage vault , across the stone floor , through the door shut down ... 
Harry took off his cloak , clamped under his arm , and started to run , running through the tunnel . 
Malfoy will go to school before it ... 
How much time does Malfoy make to find a teacher to mourn ? 
He gasped , and sank to one side , Harry still not slowing down , running a circuit to the bottom of the rock slope . 
It would have to hide the invisibility cloak here , afraid that if Malfoy went to a mermaid with a teacher , then this precious coat that was confiscated was too much . 
Harry hid the cloak after a corner , then started climbing , trying his best , his sweaty hands sliding on the sloping stairs . 
When Harry reached inside the witch's hunch , he waved his wand to open the hump , poked his head out , and swung up to get out . 
The hump closes , and Harry jumps out behind the statue and hears footsteps approaching . 
It was Snape . 
He hurried to Harry's side , his black robes flying , and stood in front of him . 
He said : 
- Well then ! ... 
In his eyes , the look of victory was suppressed , Harry tried to appear innocent innocence , despite knowing his sweaty face and muddy hands had accused him of being too obvious ; he hugged his two hands in his robes to hide . 
Snape said , 
- Potter , follow me ! 
Harry followed the master down the stairs , wiping his hands in his sack so that Snape could not see . 
They went down the stairs to the basement and into Snape's office . 
Harry had only visited Snape's office once , and that time was in a state of extreme distress . 
Since that time , Snape has collected a bunch of terrible mousses in the jars . 
Both of them stood long on the shelf behind the desk , reflecting the sparkle of the furnace fire , adding horror in the threatening atmosphere . 
Snape said , 
- - Sit down ! 
Harry sat down . 
However , Snape remained standing . 
He said : 
- Malfoy just met me to present a very strange story , Potter . 
Harry did not say a word . 
" He told me he was coming up to the Shack , and he happened to meet Wealsey - obviously he was alone . 
Harry did not open his mouth to say anything . 
Malfoy said that he was talking to Weasley when a big thump hit his back . 
How can such a thing happen ? 
Harry tried to make a slightly surprised expression : 
- Teacher , I do not know . 
Snape's eyes peered through Harry's eyes . 
The same situation as he was chasing a Bang Ma . 
Harry tried not to blink . 
- At that Malfoy saw a strange appearance . 
Can you imagine what it is , Potter ? 
Harry responded with an innocent naive voice . 
- No teacher . 
- that's the head of that game , Potter ! 
A head suspended in the air . 
Harry was silent for a long time and said , 
- Maybe she should go see Mrs. Pomfrey for medical examination . 
If she sees such a myth ... 
Snape asked softly , 
- What's the first thing you do at Hogsmeade , Potter ? 
The head of the game is allowed to wander in Hogsmeade . 
And no body part was allowed to appear at Hogsmeade ! 
Harry tries to keep his face from showing off his sin or fear : 
- Teacher , I know that . 
But it sounded like Malfoy was virtual ... 
- Malfoy is not hallucinating . 
Snape snapped his teeth . 
He bent down , his hands on the two armrests of the chair Harry was sitting , so that his face was only about three inches from his face Harry : 
- If the head of the game at Hogsmeade , the rest of the body also in Hogsmeade . 
Harry anti - processing : 
- I was in Gryffindor Tower from morning till now , as the teacher said ... 
- Can anyone be sure of that ? 
Harry could not say anything . 
Snape's thin mouth curled up into a terrible smile . 
He straightened up and said , 
- That's it . 
Everybody , from the Ministry of Magic down , are trying to keep 
Harry Potter famously out of danger Sirius Black . 
But Harry Potter is famous for playing his own law . 
Put on the body of ordinary people worry about your safety ! 
Harry Potter is wherever you go , no need to think about the consequences ! 
Harry remained silent . 
Snape was trying to provoke him to tell the truth . 
It will not be trapped . 
Mr. Snape does not have proof ... 
There is no evidence . 
Suddenly Snape said : 
- Extremely game like father , Potter . 
Snape's eyes glittering : 
- The father of the game too , extremely arrogant . 
A bit of talent on the Quidditch field made him think , super - thinker than all of us , go around the school with his friends and devotees ... 
The father and son play no different at all . 
Harry yelled , unable to restrain himself : 
- My father does not go to war . 
And I'm not ... 
Snape continued to say , taking advantage of him , his sinister face full of snares : 
- Your father does not obey the law at all . 
The law is to force the human beings to pull , but not for those who win the Quidditch cup ? 
The head of the game bulging up ... 
- - Stop it ! 
Harry suddenly stood up . 
A fierce anger , an anger that Harry had felt when he left his Privet Drive home until now . 
He did not care about Snape's tense face , or his eyes were flashing angrily : 
- What did you just say , Potter ? 
Harry yelled : 
- I said you do not rub my father . 
You know the truth . 
I have saved my life ! 
Dumbledore told me ! 
If it's not for your father's , you do not have to stay here . 
Snape's leather skin was almost changed to yogurt color . 
He whispered : 
- So the President told the game that the father of the game saved my life ? 
Or did he think that the details were too much for the precious Potter's ears ? 
Harry bit his lip . 
He does not know what happened and he does not want to see what happened - but Snape seems to know the truth . 
He said with a grin that distorted his face : 
- I hated the funny trick with the wrong ideas about the father . 
It seems to have been a glorious heroic action for so long ? Let's revise our thinking : the holy father of the game and his friends presented a very funny joke to us and made us die as if playing in the last minute his father was not scared to the cold . the legs . 
There is nothing heroic in his actions . He saved our lives just to save his life . 
If his joke succeeds , he will surely be kicked out of Hogwarts . 
Snape's jawbone and jagged teeth fluttered . 
He suddenly said : 
- flush left pocket , Potter ! 
Harry did not budge . 
He heard the noise in his ears . 
- We ' ll have to go straight to the President's office . 
Potter ! 
Hook out the bag ! 
Cold in fear , Harry slowly hooks in his pocket a package of trick trick of Zonko Gaming Room and map of the hijackers . 
Snape took a bag of tips trick Zonko . 
Harry said hurriedly , praying that he could borrow Ron to mislead him : 
- That Ron's for me ... 
It's ... bought from last trip to Hogsmeade ... 
- - Really ? 
And have you dropped your carry bag ever since ? 
How touched ... and what is this ? 
Snape took the map . 
Harry tried his best to keep his expression calm . 
He shrugged : 
" Teacher , it's just a piece of parchment paper . " 
Snape turned over the map , eyes scanning Harry : 
- Surely you do not need to use an old parchment , right ? 
Why not ... throw it away ? 
Mr. Snape put his hand near the fireplace . 
Harry hastily said : 
- do not ! 
Snape's long nose twitched snatchily : 
- Well then ! 
Surely this is a precious gift from Mr. Weasley ? 
Or is it ... something else ? 
Perhaps a letter written in invisible ink ? 
Or how to go to Hogsmeade without having to go through the dementors of Azkaban ? 
Harry blinked , and Snape's eyes flickered . 
He withdrew his wand , straightened the paper on his desk , murmured : 
- let's see ... let's see ... 
Let's reveal your secret ! 
Mr. Snape put his wand on the parchment . 
Nothing happens . 
Harry clenched his hands tightly to relieve it . 
Mr. Snape put his wand on the parchment , saying : 
- Come on out ! 
The parchment was still empty . 
Harry inhaled deep breaths , calm . 
Mr. Snape knocked on the parchment again , raising his voice : 
- Professor Severus Snape , master of Hogwarts , ordered you to reveal the information that you are holding ! 
As if there was an invisible handwriting on the parchment , the lines appeared in turn on the flat surface of the pirate map . 
- Mr. Dreamer Snape praised Professor Snape , and asked him to stop his monstrous big nose innocent of the story of the evil man . 
Snape stood dead . 
Harry glared at him , also surprised to death before the words . 
But the map did not stop the letter there . 
Under the first line the following lines appear : 
- Mr. Gao Nai agreed with Mr. Dream , and he added that Professor Snape was a nasty old man . 
If Harry's situation was not extremely stressful then what was going on was funny . 
Add new words : 
- Want to express the surprise that such a fool that also became a professor . 
Harry closed his eyes in horror . 
As he opened his eyes , the map of the hijackers finally ended : 
" Wormtail wished Professor Snape a good day , and advised him to go wash his clothes , dirty shit ! 
Harry waited for the catastrophe to fall on his head . 
But Snape said gently : 
- so ... 
We will solve this game ... 
He strode to the fire , scooping a handful of iridescent powder in the jar on the mantelpiece , tossing them into the fire . 
Mr. Snape called over the fire : 
- Lupine ! 
I want to talk . 
Harry stared at the fire , extremely bewildered . 
From the fireplace a large figure twirled rapidly . 
A few seconds later , Professor Lupine climbed out of the fireplace , his hands rubbing dust ashes on his sleek slacks . 
Teacher said : 
- Did you call me , Mr. Severus ? 
Mr. Snape walked back to the desk , his face scowling away with anger . 
- yes , I just called . 
I just told Potter to flip his pocket . This is what it hides in your pocket . 
Mr. Snape pointing at the parchment still clearly recognizes the lines of the mournful Dreamer , the tail of the Worm , the Stuffed Feet , and the Gauntlet . 
A strange feeling was hidden in Lupine's face . 
Snape asked : 
- - Star ? 
Lupine stared at the map . 
Harry felt that Lupine was thinking very fast . 
Snape asked again : 
- - Star ? 
This parchment is clearly filled with black magic . 
As far as his specialty is concerned , Lupine . 
Can you imagine where Potter was going to find such a thing ? 
Lupine glanced up , half glancing at Harry's warning that it was not a joke . 
Lupine remembers Snape's words : 
- full of black magic ? 
Do you honestly believe so , Severus ? 
As far as I know , it's just a parchment that insults anyone who tries to read it . 
A childish game , but certainly not dangerous . 
I guess Harry's got this at a junk shop . 
- - Really ? 
Snape asked . 
His jaw hardened with anger . 
" Do you think a joke can sell something like that ? " 
Do not you think that the game directly from the makers of the sound more reasonable ? 
Harry did not understand what Snape was talking about . 
And it seems Lupine does not understand . 
He said : 
" Do you mean that from the tail of the worm or some of these people ? 
Harry , do you know any of them ? 
Harry hurriedly : 
- Teacher , no . 
Lupine turned to Snape : 
- See , Severus ? 
In my opinion , it's just a toy shop Zonko ... 
At that moment , Ron ran into Mr. Snape's office . 
It nearly broke , stopped at Snape's desk , rubbed the throbbing pain on his chest and tried to say : 
- I ... gave ... that ... 
for ... Harry . 
I bought ... 
it's at the store ... 
Zonko ... 
from ... 
long ... 
already ... 
- That's it ! 
Lupine clapped his hands together and looked around excitedly : 
- So it's clear ! 
Mr. Severus , can I get this parchment ? 
He put the map back , put it in the pocket of the slacks : 
- Harry , Ron , two games to follow me , I need to say two words about the vampire essay . 
Please forgive us , Mr. Snape ? 
Harry did not dare to look at Snape when he left his office . 
She followed him along quietly with Lupine back to the lobby . 
Harry then turned to Lupine : 
- Teacher , son ... 
Lupine said briefly : 
- I do not want to hear an explanation . 
He glanced around the empty hall and lowered his voice , saying : 
- He happened to know that this map has been confiscated by Mr. Filch for many years now . 
Oh , you know it's a map . 
Harry and Ron were amazed . 
Lupine continued : 
- I do not want to know how it falls into my hands . 
However , he was shocked that you did not bring it back . Especially after the incident happened when a student dropped some information about the castle . 
You can not return this map , Harry . 
Harry was not surprised by that decision , and was so eager to answer questions that he was not disturbed by the decision to confiscate Lupine's map . 
" Teacher , why do you think Snape thinks you get the map from the makers ? " 
Lupine hesitated : 
- Because ... because the makers of this map want to lure you out of school . 
They are so incredibly exciting . 
Asked Harry , voice agitated : 
- Do you know those people ? 
- Have you met them ? 
Lupine leaned back and looked at Harry more sternly than ever : 
" Harry , do not expect me to cover you again next time . " 
You can not make me matter to Sirius Black . 
But I thought that what I heard when the dementors of Azkaban came closer to me had more impact on me . 
Your cheeks risk your life for you to survive , Harry . 
They rewarded them so badly ... to sacrifice their sacrifice for a joke ! 
He walked away , leaving Harry in a worse mood than when he was snapped at by his teacher . 
He and Ron slowly climbed up the marble stairs . 
As Harry walked past the statue of a witch , he remembered the invisibility cloak : the shirt was still there , but now he did not dare to take it back . 
Ron suddenly said : 
- that's my fault . 
I got you . 
Lupine is right . 
To do so is foolish . 
We should not do that ... 
It stops horizontally ; They went to the corridor where the security dwarves patrolled the guard , and Hermione was walking toward them . 
Just looking at her face was enough for Harry to know for sure Hermione had heard what had happened . 
Its heart is as heavy as lead . 
Do not know she has gone to mc with Professor McGonagall ? 
When Hermione stopped in front of them , Ron said cruelly : 
- To see your eyes ? 
Or have you just finished reading this ? 
- - Are not ! 
Hermione was squeezing a letter in her hand and her lips trembling : 
- I just think you should know ... 
Hagrid lost the case . 
The Buckbeak Code of Death is about to be executed ! 
Chapter 15 
QUIDDITCH COMPLETE 
Hermione held up the letter , saying : 
- He sent me this . 
Harry took the letter . 
The wet parchment and tears kept squinting in so many places that it was hard to read the letter . 
Harry , we lose the case . 
You can take it to the Hog warts . 
The execution date has been set . 
Beaky loves London . 
You will never forget the help that you have for me . 
Hagrid . 
Harry exclaimed : 
- They can not do it . 
Impossible ! 
Buckbeak is not dangerous at all 
Where ? 
Hermione wiped her eyes , saying : 
- Three of Malfoy threatened the Commission in this . 
You know who he is . 
That committee was full of old fools , and they feared Malfoy's death . 
Anyway , the appeal can still be appealed , and the court will always have that case . 
The only thing that I did not see any hope ... nothing will change . 
Ron said , 
- Yes , it will change . 
You will no longer struggle alone , Hermione . 
I will help you . 
" Oh , Ron ! 
Hermione wrapped her arms around Ron's neck and sobbed . 
Ron , with horror , patted Hermione on the head to comfort her in a clumsy manner . 
Finally Hermione did not let go of Ron . 
She sobbed : 
- Ron , I'm really , really sorry about the Scrabbers ... 
- - Oh ... 
then ... it's too old . 
Ron seemed glad to have Hermione let go . 
It says : 
- With it , it is a little inconvenient . 
Which is where my parents will buy me an owl ! 
The security measures imposed on all students from Black's second entry make Harry , Ron and Hermione unable to visit Hagrid in the evening . 
The only opportunity they could talk to was in the Mystery Care classroom . 
The Commission's decision made him shocked to death . 
- Failure at all . 
The mouth of the tongue lingers . 
They all sat out in black robes , but he just dropped the paper and forgot all the days that he looked up to her , Hermione . 
And then Lucius Malfoy stood up to say his fault , then the Commission did exactly what he did . 
Said Ron aggressively : 
- Appeal to be able to ! 
Do not give up , we're looking forward to it ! 
The three returned to the castle with the other pupils . 
They could see Malfoy walking in front of him , talking to Crabbe and Goyle , glaring at the three of them back and laughing at him . 
At the castle , Hagrid said sadly , 
- Do not accrue anything , Ron . 
The Commission is no different from the item in Lucius Malfoy's pocket . 
There is only water left to make the last days of Buckbeak the happiest days of his life . 
You owe it that ... 
Hagrid turned away , hurried back to his hut , hiding his face in his handkerchief . 
Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle stood in the door of the castle listening : 
- Elder old man to compensate for the speaker ! 
Malfoy said : 
- Have you ever seen something so tragic like this ? 
But that dowry is considered as our teacher ! 
Harry and Ron were both upset in front of Malfoy , but Hermione had taken over all of it - CHAT ! 
She straightened her arms and slapped Malfoy in the face . 
Malfoy staggered . 
Harry , Ron , Crabbe and Goyle both stood dead in shock as Hermione raised her arm again . 
- I dare to call Hagrid a tragic , but mi is rotten , evil ... 
Ron took Hermione's arm , weakly interfering : 
- Hermione ! 
Hermione strong zone to escape : 
- Get out , Ron ! 
Hermione pulled out her wand . 
Malfoy stepped back . 
Crabbe and Goyle looked puzzled , looking at Malfoy waiting for instructions . 
Malfoy murmured : 
- - go ! 
In the blink of an eye , the three of them disappear into the corridor leading down to the basement . 
Ron repeated , " Hermione ! " 
Hermione hissed . 
- Harry , you must defeat it in the Quidditch final ! 
You have to win , because I will not be able to stand if Slytherin wins . 
Ron looked up at Hermione , but said , 
- We went to study Charms . 
The children hurried up the marble stairs toward Professor Flitwick's classroom . 
When Harry opened the classroom , Flitwick blurted out : 
- The delay is there ! 
Go to the seat , grab the wand . 
Today's lesson will be to test the Blessed Charm . 
The other games are divided into pairs ... 
Harry and Ron hurried to the back seat and opened the pair . 
Ron looked behind him : 
- Where is Hermione ? 
Harry also looked around . 
Hermione did not walk in the classroom , though Harry was sure she was right next to him as she opened the classroom door . 
Harry glared at Ron : 
- How strange ? 
Maybe ... maybe he's in the toilet or something ? 
But all that time , Hermione did not return to class . 
When the whole class finished school for lunch , everyone grinned . 
Said Ron : 
- Hermione should have been able to make a charm for himself . 
Charms have made them feel very excited excited . 
But Hermione was also absent from the lunch room . 
When they ate apple desserts , the " aftertaste " of the Charms grew , Harry and Ron began to feel a bit nervous . 
As they hastily climbed up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower , Ron anxiously said , 
" What do you think Malfoy did to Hermione ? " 
They walked past the dwarf security , read the passwords to Ms . Beo ( Flibbertigibbet ) - and squeezed through the hole in the living room . 
Hermione was asleep by a desk , head placed on the Arithmetic book to open . 
Harry and Ron sat on Hermione's side , teasing her up . 
Hermione startled , waking awake , gazing out at her , 
- Ca ... 
the ... 
what ? Are you studying now ? 
Now what subject do we study ? 
Harry said : 
- Prophet , but still twenty minutes to class . 
Hermione , why do not you go to class ? 
Hermione squealed : 
- - What ? Oh , come on ! 
I forget to go to class charms ! 
Harry was surprised : 
- How can you forget ? 
You go to the classroom with us ! 
Hermione moaned : 
- I can not believe it ! 
Is Professor Flitwick so angry ? 
Oh , that's right 
Malfoy , I thought about it and forget everything ! 
Ron looked down at the big Arithmetic that Hermione used to put her head up like a pillow : 
- You know , Hermione ? 
I see you exhausted to the place already . 
You try to do too much ! 
- Where there is ! 
I'm exhausted ! 
Cried Hermione , stroking her hair from her eyes , looking helplessly to find her bag : 
- I was just a little confused , that's all . 
I should go to see Professor Flitwick to apologize for the better . 
See you in the class of the prophet home ! 
Twenty minutes later Hermione joins Harry and Ron at the foot of the stairs leading up to Professor Trelawney's classroom , looking extremely saddened : 
- I can not believe I'm missing the Charm ! 
I dare to bet that when the game is out of it . 
Professor Flitwick has said far and near to be able to take that test ! 
Together we climbed the stairs leading to the murky room at the top of the tower . 
On each small table is a pearly crystalline sphere filled with pearl - white mist . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione sit together around a rickety table . 
Ron turned a wary eye to Trelawney , in case she lurked nearby . 
It is : 
- I thought we would have to learn Crystal Bridge next semester . 
Harry whispered back : 
- Do not complain anymore , this means that we have already completed the fortune telling . 
I was fed up with the crook of fear of the neck each time looking at his hands . 
- Good day ! 
The familiar mysterious voice resounded , and Professor Trelawney from the darkness appeared suddenly as dramatically as usual . 
Parvati and Lavender trembled with excitement , their faces illuminated by the reflection of the crystal ball . 
Professor Trelawney sat himself down in a chair with his back to the fireplace , looking around : 
- I have decided to introduce crystal bridges slightly earlier than expected . The fate has instructed me that the June exams will have fiancé , and I have to take care of the practice . 
Hermione snorted . 
She said without bothering to lower her voice : 
- Well , honestly ... the so - called " destined instruction " ... 
Who's out ? 
Teacher no one ! 
The prediction of the stars that really hurt ! 
It is hard to say that Professor Trelawney had heard Hermione's words , because her face was hidden in the darkness . 
But she continued as if she did not hear anything . 
She said dreamily : 
- The crystal bridge is a very special art of essence . 
I did not expect any of them . When I first looked at the crystal depths of the crystal ball . 
We will start by practicing the relaxation of consciousness and external ... 
Ron started giggling , unable to hold back , and he had to tuck his muzzle to silence . 
- ... to make clear the Inner Eye and the supernatural . 
Maybe , if we're lucky , some of the games will be seen before the end of the class . 
And everyone starts . 
At the very least , Harry was extremely stupid when he stared at the crystal ball , trying to keep his mind empty as thoughts like " this stupid thing ... " glided over his mind . . 
It did not matter when Ron kept giggling , and Hermione kept chattering . 
After about fifteen minutes trying to quietly stare at the crystal bridge , Harry asked the two of them : 
- See what ? 
Ron pointed , 
- See , there is a burn on this hand , probably someone has made the candle fall . 
Cried Hermione . 
- This game is a waste of time . 
I should be able to practice something else more useful . I was able to catch up with the Charm ... 
Professor Trelawney rushed past the three of them . 
She murmured in the croaking bruises of the bracelets : 
- Would anyone want me to explain the dim indications in my crystal ball ? 
Ron murmured : 
- I do not need help . 
What this sign means is very clear : tonight it will be full of fog . 
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing . 
Every head turned toward them . 
Parvati and Lavender are outraged . 
Professor Trelawney said : 
- that , really ! 
The game is breaking the wave of prophecy ! 
She approached their table and looked at the crystal ball . 
Harry felt his heart sag . 
He made sure he knew what was going to happen . 
Professor Trelawney sat next to the bridge , letting the ball reflect into two of her huge mirrors and whisper : 
- There is something here ! 
Something is moving ... but what is that ? 
Harry is prepared to bet whatever he has , including the Lightning Rod , that " something " is certainly not a good news , no matter what . 
That's right ... 
Professor Trelawney breathed , looking up at Harry : 
- It's here , it's clearer than ever ... 
Oh , he's sneaky hunting , coming closer than ever ... Hung ... 
Said Hermione loudly : 
- Oh , heaven and hell , please do not repeat that crazy little Hung again ! 
Professor Trelawney raised her huge eyes to look at Hermione's face . 
Parvati whispered something to Lavender , and both of them glared at Hermione . 
Professor Trelawney straightened up , examining Hermione with an unmistakable rage . 
- I'm sorry to say that from the moment you entered this class , darling , it was obvious that the game did not have the qualities required by the noble art of prophecy . 
Indeed , we can not remember whether we have ever met a student whose mind is so helpless in this way . 
A moment of heavy silence . 
Suddenly ... 
- Good ! 
Hermione suddenly said , standing up and stuffing her book in front of the Future Screen . 
She repeats : 
- - Fine ! 
Throwing the bag over his shoulder and touching Ron almost tossed back from the chair , Hermione said , 
- I give up ! 
Let's go ! 
And to the amazement of the class , Hermione walked across the classroom to the door like a trap trapped , kicked it open , climbed down the stairs , and went out of sight . 
Until a few minutes after the new stable . 
Professor Trelawney seems to have forgotten what he did . 
She suddenly turned to Harry and Ron's table , panting and shaking the shawl closely . 
Lavender suddenly screamed and made everyone startled . 
- Oh ! 
Professor Trelawney , I just remembered ! 
You see she left school , right ? Are not you the professor ? 
By Easter , one of us will leave us forever ! 
The professor has said that for a long time , is not it professor ? 
Professor Trelawney gave a smile to Lavender , a dewy smile . 
- Yes , my dear , I know in advance that the Granger game will leave us . 
However , it is hoped that one may confuse the signs ... 
You know , Inner Labels can be a burden ... 
Lavender and Parvati moved deeply and moved to one side so that Professor Trelawney could enter the table . 
Ron looked frightened , with Harry : 
- Hey , one bad day for Hermione ! 
- Ừ . 
Harry glanced up at the crystal bridge , but saw nothing but a faint white mist . 
Did not know if Professor Trelawney had seen the glass again ? 
And it , does it see ? 
If so , there would be only one " dead " accident that would be enough , but the Quidditch finals were coming closer . 
o 0 o 
The Easter holidays that the children also not fully relax . 
Some third - year students have never been sentenced to such many exercises . 
Neville Longbottom is just a little nervous breakdown , which is not the only one . 
One afternoon , Seamus Finnigan roared in the common room : 
- This is called holiday ? 
What is the last game of the year ? 
But no one had to do much exercise like Hermione . 
Even leaving the Prophet , she still studied more subjects than all other children . 
Hermione was usually the last person to leave the common room in the evening , and was the first to go to the library the next morning . 
Her eyes had dark circles beneath them , just like Lupine's eyes , and it seemed like tears were coming . 
Ron took responsibility for the appeal to Buckbeak . 
While not having to do his homework , Ron raises his nose at the bulky books like the Codebook and the Devil's Book . 
A Resurrection on the Hunger of the Code . 
It was so irresistible that he forgot to treat all of Crookshanks . 
At the same time , Harry had to arrange his homework to have time to practice Quidditch every day , not to mention endless lengthy tactical discussions with Wood . 
The match between Slytherin and Gryffindor will take place on the first Saturday after Easter . Slytherin is currently topping the table with just over two hundred points . This means ( as Wood regularly reminds the team ) that the Gryffindors need to win this game with a score higher than two hundred points to win the Quidditch Cup . 
It also means that Harry has to shoulder the responsibility of winning , because catching Snitch balls is rewarded a hundred and fifty points . 
Wood kept telling Harry : 
- So I only caught Snitch when my team won at least fifty points . 
Only if we lead more than fifty , remember Harry , but if we won the match , we could not win the Quidditch Cup . 
You know that , Harry ? 
You can only catch Snitch if we take the lead ... 
Harry yelled : 
- I KNOW YOU OLIVER ! 
The Gryffindor are haunted by the coming match . 
Since the legendary Charlie Weasley ( Ron's second son ) until now , the Gryffindor never won the Quidditch Cup again . 
But Harry is convinced that none of Gryffindor's , including Wood , is eager to compete for the Quidditch Cup itself , Harry . 
The feud between Harry and Malfoy has reached its peak . 
Malfoy was still pinned in the fact that Harry had thrown himself at Hogsmeade , and it was even more frenzied that Harry had escaped punishment . 
Harry had not forgotten that Malfoy had attempted to subdue it in battle with Ravenclaw , but it was Buckbeak that made Harry more determined to defeat Malfoy before the rest of the school . 
As far as people remember , there was never a game that was close to the day when the air was so tense . 
As the holidays have passed , the tension between the two teams and the two houses has reached a boom . 
Some small hiatus occurred in the corridor , the most severe of which resulted in a fourth year of Gryffindor and a sixth year of Slytherin being infected with hearing loss . Leaning on leeks . 
This is a particularly bad time for Harry . 
He could not go to class without the Slytherins kneeling or trying to make his feet fall . 
It went wherever Crabbe and Goyle stalked and jumped out in frustration when there was a crowd around Harry . 
Wood had instructed Harry to always be accompanied by people everywhere , in case the Slytherins would conspire to get Harry out of the fight . 
The Gryffindor family did so in a hurry so badly that Harry could not attend class on time , because it kept getting stuck in the middle of a crowded crowd . 
Harry himself is much more worried about his Thunderbolt than he is about himself . 
When not using the broomstick , he locked the broom in the chest , and then regularly to Gryffindor Tower at the time of play to check that the lightning rod is still there .

In the evening before the game , the Gryffindor common room was not as private as it used to be . 
Even Hermione had to drop her books . 
She said anxiously : 
- I can not study . 
I can not concentrate . 
The room was very noisy . 
Fred and George were so stressed that they froze and jangled over ever . 
Wood crouched on the model of Quidditch Stadium in the corner of the room , using his wand to poke some of the dummy on the court , then mumbled to himself . 
Angelina , Alicia and Katie laughed at the jokes of Fred and George . 
Harry sat with Ron and Hermione , separated from that bustling center , trying not to think about the next day , because every time he thought it was horrible to have something big I was scolding him in the stomach . 
Hermione looked terrified , but she tried to say , 
- You will be fine . 
Ron emphasizes : 
- You have a lightning bolt ! 
Harry snapped , saying , 
- Ừ ... 
It was a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and screamed : 
- The whole team pay attention ! bedtime ! 
o 0 o 
Harry is sleepy dreaming . 
At first it was dreaming , and Wood was shouting : 
- - Where are you ? 
We must use Neville to replace you ! 
Then he dreamed of Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin squad flying to the field . 
He was flying at a speed that would break his neck as he played , trying to dodge the flames that spewed from the dragon's mouth that Malfoy was riding on . 
Suddenly he realized that he forgot the lightning bolt , so that it fell straight from the air and started to wake up . 
It took a few seconds for Harry to remember that the match had not yet taken place , that it was still safe in bed , and that Slytherin was definitely not allowed to ride the Quidditch Dragons . 
He felt thirsty throat dry . 
Quietly , Harry got out of bed and poured himself a glass of water from a silver jug ​​ placed under the window . 
School grounds are still quiet and deserted . 
No breeze or breath can shake trees in the Forbidden Forest . 
Liao Roi is also immobile and looks naive in appearance . 
It all seems as if the conditions for the match are perfect . 
Harry put down his glass and was about to return to bed when his eyes suddenly caught sight of something , something crawling across the lawn of silver in the night . 
Harry rushed to the small table next to his bed , snapping his glasses into his eyes , then hurried back to the window . 
There is no reason - not , not now - not immediately before the game like this ! 
Harry scanned the school grounds again , and after a minute of searching his eyes , he found it . 
Now it's going to go along the edge of the forest ... it's not cool ... it's a cat ... 
Harry clasped his hand against the window ledge as he realized the tail was like a bottle of broom . 
That one can only be Crookshanks ... 
Is not Crookshanks alone ? Harry squinted , his eyes fixed on the glass . 
Crookshanks seems to be standing . 
Harry is convinced that the cat is also seeing something moving in the shade of the tree . 
Just a moment later , the object appeared a large dark - skinned black dog sneaking across the lawn , Crookshanks lining up on the side . 
Harry glared at him . 
What does that mean ? 
If Crookshanks also saw the dog , how could that dog be harbored before Harry's death ? 
He whispered softly : 
- Ron ! 
Get up , Ron ! 
- - Huh ? 
- I need you to tell me that you see this ? 
Ron's voice was sleepy : 
" It was dark , Harry . 
What do you wake up to ? 
- Come here ... 
Harry turned quickly to the window . 
Crookshanks and the dog are gone . 
Harry climbed up to the window sill to try to look at the shade of the castle , but neither of them was there . 
Where did the animals go ? 
A loud snarl sounded to tell Ron that Ron had sunk into deep sleep . 
o 0 o 
Harry and the other Gryffindors entered the Great Hall the following morning with applause and applause . 
Harry could not help grinning at the sight of both Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students clapping their hands together . Slytherin's students screeched as they passed by their desks . 
Harry noticed that Malfoy seemed to be more merry than usual . 
Wood left the breakfast to advise people to try to eat , while he himself did not touch a dish . Then when nobody finished eating , he hurriedly kicked everyone off the field , so that the team could have a sense of the conditions of the game . 
When the team left the Hall , everyone cheered again . 
Cho Chang shouted : 
- Good luck to Harry ! 
Harry felt embarrassed . 
Wood walked quickly on the field , with Gryffindor team behind him , looking around , saying , 
- Oh ... the wind is not significant ... the sun is a bit dazzling , this can limit our view , please pay close attention ... the ground is a little hard , well , it helps them I turn up quickly ... 
Finally , Wood saw the door of the castle open in the distance , and the entire Hogwarts school rushed toward the stadium . 
Wood ordered to go to sleep : 
- - Dressing room ! 
No one said anything when the team wore purple robes . 
Harry did not know if the other people felt as if they were feeling it : as if he had just finished his breakfast with a bunch of crooks . 
And almost no one has heard the Wood urge : 
- okay , it's time for us to go ... 
The Gryffindor squad came into the ring in a loud scream . 
Three - fourths of the crowd wore purple scarves , waving purple flags with the Gryffindor lion badge , or hanging banners with slogans such as " GRYFFINDOR GRADUATION ! " And " GETTING AWAY FROM THE GRYFFINDOR ! " 
But behind the Slytherin gates were two hundred people in green , the Slytherin snake glittering on the flags of the house , and Professor Snape sitting in the front row , wearing a blue shirt . the others , on the teacher's lips a sinister smile . 
As usual , Lee Jordan played the match commentator . 
It is proclaiming : 
- And here's the Gryffindors ! 
Potter , Bell , Johnson , Spinnet , Weasley , Weasley and Wood . 
They are recognized by the public as a good team of Hogwarts that people have seen in recent years ... 
Lee Jordan's comments were drowned out by the angry shout from the crowd on the Slytherin side . 
- And now the Slytherin team , led by captain Flint . 
Flint has made some changes in the squad and seems to prefer size rather than skill . 
The Slytherin crowd was booing . 
However , Harry found that Jordan was justified . 
Malfoy is probably the most compact in the Slytherin team , but the others , one of them as he is giant . 
Ms . Hooch : 
- Two captain shaking hands ! 
Flint and Wood approached each other and the man took the other's hand tightly ; It looks as if this person is trying to break the other's fingers . 
Ms . Hooch ordered : 
- Climb up the broom ! 
Three ... 
Hai ... 
One ... 
Her whistle had just been lost in the roar of the crowd as fourteen broomsticks bounced up into the air . 
Harry felt his hair fly backwards , anxiety had given way to excitement flying in the Lightning Rod ; glancing around , saw Malfoy clutching his tail , and then sped up to find the Snitch . 
- And now Gryffindor are holding the ball , Gryffindor's Alicia and the Quaffle are aiming for the Slytherin goal . okay , Alicia ! 
Oh no ... Quaffle left by Warrington , Slytherin's Warrington rising high on the field ... 
HAPPY ! 
Well , George played a breathtaking Bludger , Warrington dropped the Quaffle , then Johnson was immediately arrested , Gryffindor Johnson again got the ball , trying to , Angelina ... a twist to dodge Montague . . 
Hey , come down , Angelina , there's a flying bludger ... ANGELINA HAS BEEN TAKEN ! 
10 - 0 , for GRYFFINDOR ! 
Angelina burst into the air as she soared to the end of the ring , the sea of ​​ red purple screamed with joy ... 
- Oh ! 
Angelina nearly burst out of the broom she was riding because Marcus Flint crashed in . The crowd roared to booing , Flint said : 
- - Sorry ! 
Sorry , I did not see her ... 
Shortly thereafter , Fred Weasley sticks to the assassin's stick in the back of Flint's head . 
Flint's nose pounded on its broom , bleeding profusely . 
Hooch flew between them , hissing : 
- - Foul ! 
A penalty for the Gryffindor for a uninvited attack on their Sham ! 
A penalty for Slytherin for calculating damage to their Shamans ! 
Fred screamed : 
- Well , you ! 
But Hooch whistled the whistle and Alicia rushed forward to execute the penalty . 
- Come on , Alicia ! 
Lee screamed in the silence of the crowd at the bridge . 
- NO ! ALICIA HAS DEFINED THE DEPARTMENT ! 
20 - 0 , score for GRYFFINDOR ! 
Harry turned around the broom of Tia Lightning , watching Flint fly in to make a penalty for Slytherin , whose nose was still bleeding . 
Wood was hovering in front of Gryffindor's goal post , his jaw clenched . 
Lee Jordan explained to the crowd : 
- Of course Wood is a super captain ! 
Excellent ! 
It's hard to overcome ... it's hard ... RA ! I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT ! WOOD HAS BEEN BANNED ! 
Harry looked relieved , looking around again for the Snitch , but kept all of Lee Jordan's comments . What was important to Harry now was to have Malfoy let Snitch not catch Snitch until Gryffindor reached the top fifty . 
- Gryffindor again ... 
Oh , no , Slytherin got the ball ... 
are not ! ... 
Gryffindor has just won the ball and Katie Bell , Gryffindor's Katie Bell is holding the Quaffle , she's flopping through the arena ... ACCEPTING THE BODY IS AWESOME ! 
The Slytherin sitter , Montague , cut off the flight just in front of Katie , and instead of snatching the Quaffle , it caught her on the head . 
Katie tumbled in the air , trying to balance her broom , but dropped the Quaffle . 
Hooch's whistle sounded again as she jumped up over Montague and shouted at it . 
A minute later , Katie pushed a penalty kick over the Slytherin captain . 
- THREE MINES - NO ! STYLING TO PLAY , PLAY AGAIN ... 
- Jordan , if you can not stop commenting like that ... 
- Professor , you report exactly as the game is going on ! 
Harry felt a surge of excitement . 
He spotted Snitch - a spinning ball at the foot of one of Gryffindor's posts . 
But it can not catch Snitch at this moment . 
And if Malfoy sees the ball ... 
Facing a suddenly focused face , Harry pulled his lightning bolt of revolver back up , speeding toward the Slytherin gates . 
This game is very effective . 
Malfoy immediately followed closely behind Harry , apparently thinking he saw Snitch's side there . 
VUUÚÚÚT ! 
One of the two crossed Bludgers carried Harry's ear , straight to Derrick , Slytherin's crook . 
Immediately ... 
VUUUÚÚÚT ! 
The second Bludger flies over Harry's elbow . 
Another player - Slytherin's Bole - is next to it . 
Harry glanced quickly , seeing Bole and Derrick plunging toward him , sticks high up . 
Harry's right at the last moment soared high , causing Bole and Derrick to hit each other with a scream . 
Lee Jordan laughed as the two Slytherins swayed away from each other , their heads shaking . 
- Too bad , dear children ! 
Want to beat a lightning bolt , you have to get up early soon ! 
And now Gryffindor got the ball , Johnson was holding the Quaffle ... 
Flint is following her ... teasing his eyes , Angelina ! 
You play a little , Professor ! 
Just kidding ! 
Oh , no ! 
Flint wins the Quaffle , Flint flies straight to Gryffindor's goal post , tries to get to Wood , protects ... 
But Flint did the table ! 
From the crowd of Slytherin fans bursting a scream and Lee swearing so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to get away from the witch's siren . 
- Professor , I'm sorry ! 
That will not happen again ! 
So Gryffindor are leading 30 - 10 , and Gryffindor are holding the ball ... 
This match turned out to be the worst game ever played by Harry . 
Furious with Gryffindor's lead , the Slytherin players quickly use whatever means to win the Quaffle . 
Bole punched Alicia with her stick and then made a correction that she thought she was a Bludger . 
George Weasley retaliated by pushing elbows right in the middle of Bole's face . 
Hooch won a penalty for each team , and Wood repeated another spectacular shot , raising the score to Gryffindor 40 - 10 . 
Snitch lost away . 
Malfoy still hangs up to Harry whenever he soars above the game , looking round the ball - once the Gryffindor team is ahead of fifty . 
Katie scored another goal : 50 - 10 . 
Fred and George were hovering around the little girl , the canes high in the air , in the presence of any Slytherin who was intent on rinsing . 
But while Fred and George are busy guarding Katie , Bole and Derrick aim for the Bludger in Wood . 
The left and the left , the two straight to Wood , and the guy must flip the cat in the air , clinging to the broom , painful break always . 
Ms . Hooch furious . 
Her voice shouted to Bole and Derrick : 
- You can not attack the captain unless Quaffle is in the penalty area ! 
Penalty for Gryffindor . 
And Angelina made beautiful tables . 
60 - 10 ! 
A moment later , Fred Weasley crashed a Bludger into Warrington , dislodging the Quaffle from his hands ; Alicia immediately caught up with Slytherin : 70 - 10 ! 
The crowd of Gryffindor fans cheered . The Gryffindor team had sixty ahead , and if Harry had caught the Snitch now , then the Trophy 
Quidditch will belong to Gryffindor . 
Harry could almost feel the hundreds of eyes watching as it soared up around the stadium , high above all the other players , with Malfoy speeding up behind him . 
And then Harry saw the Snitch . 
It was sparkling about seven yards above Harry . 
Harry sped up the speed , the wind whistling in his ear ; It stretched out his hand , but suddenly , the Thunderbolt was jammed ... 
Terrified , Harry looked around . 
Malfoy leaped forward , grabbed the Thunderbolt's tail and tried to pull it back . 
- Games 
Harry was so angry that he was ready to punch Malfoy's face , but he could not hit . 
Malfoy gasped for the lightning bolt , but his eyes flashed brightly . 
It got what it wanted : the Snitch ball had disappeared . 
Hooch went to Malfoy back to his 2001 Nimbus broom . 
Hooch sounded : 
- - Penalty ! 
Penalty for Gryffindor ! 
I have never seen such a tactic ! 
Jumping out of Professor McGonagall's arms , Lee Jordan howled through the witch's loudspeaker : 
- - ALWAYS WILL BE BACK ! WANT TO DIE FIRE 
Even Professor McGonagall now does not even take Lee Jordan's words . 
She fumbled at Malfoy ; Her hat fell , and she , too , screamed angrily . 
Alicia made a penalty for Gryffindor , but the girl was in anger and missed the goal . The Gryffindor team lost focus and the Slytherin - rejoicing with Malfoy's disgusting playfulness - rejoiced in spirit . 
Lee Jordan moaned : 
- Slytherin holding the ball , Slytherin aiming for golf ... 
Montague made the table ! 
7020 ! 
Now Harry was clinging to Malfoy so well that their knees collided . 
Harry will not let Malfoy get anywhere with Snitch . 
When Malfoy turned around and saw Harry block his way , he went wild : 
- Get out , Potter ! 
- Angelina is holding the Quaffle ball for Gryffindor team , up , Angelina , UP ! 
Harry looked around . 
With the exception of Malfoy , all the Slytherins , including the Capitol , were swarming across the court , heading for Angelina - all of them all blocking Angelina . 
Harry tugged at the lightning bolt , bent so low that his body was close to the broom , and he kicked hard to make it forward . 
It shoots me out of Slytherin like a bullet . 
- AAA ! 
The Slytherin crowd scattered as the Thunderbolt lunged at them . Alicia's road was open . 
- ALICIA RECORDING ! ALICIA HAS BEEN DONE ! Gryffindor led 80 - 20 ! 
Harry scrambled to head straight to the stands , trying to win back in the middle of the sky , turned around and looped in the middle of the field . 
And suddenly he saw something that stopped his heart . 
Malfoy was descending with a cheeky expression on his face - Kia , beneath the surface of the grass about a meter , was a tiny ball of gold glistening . 
Harry threw the lightning bolt down , but Malfoy ran ahead of him . 
- - Hurry up ! 
Hurry up ! 
Hurry up ! 
Harry urgently urged his broom . 
The distance between it and Malfoy is short ... 
Harry leaned against the broomstick to avoid Bole throwing him a Bludger ... 
He caught up with Malfoy's ankle ... it flew with Malfoy ... 
Coming forward , Harry dropped both hands from the broom . 
Harry squeezed Malfoy's arms and ... 
- THANK YOU ! 
Harry raised his arm up in the air , and the stadium exploded . 
Harry jumped up over the crowd , his ears racing wildly . 
The tiny golden ball was clutched in his hand , beating the wings of Harry's fingers helplessly . 
Then Wood ran madly at Harry , so full of tears that he could not see clearly . 
He threw his neck on Harry's shoulders , unable to hold back the emotion . 
Harry senses two of Fred and George's worth ; Then came the voice of Angelina , Alicia , and Katie : 
- We won the trophy ! 
We won the trophy ! 
Stumbling in tight hugging arms and clenching , and screaming to hoarse voices , the Gryffindor team landed on the ground . 
End of this phase to the other fans in the purple flowing through the barrier to the stadium . 
Hands like rain on the back they are continuous . 
Harry has a very nervous feeling with his body pressed against it . 
After that , Harry and the Gryffindor team got the canal on the shoulders . 
Pushing aside for a moment , Harry saw Hagrid , his hair covered with bouquets of red roses . 
- I knocked them down , Harry , I knocked them down ! 
You will tell Buckbeak , wait ! 
There was Percy , who was dancing like a madman , forgot all dignity and sanctity . 
Professor McGonagall was sobbing more than Wood , and she had to use Gryffindor's great flag to wipe away tears . 
And , well , Ron and Hermione are struggling to get close to Harry . 
They can not speak . 
They simply looked at each other with a bright smile , as Harry reached the canal toward the stands , where Dumbledore was waiting with a great Quidditch trophy . 
Now that there are the Azkaban dementors around here ... 
When Woodman was scurrying to hand Harry the cup , as he lifted the cup up , Harry felt it could create the world's most delicious guardian god . 
Chapter 16 
TRELAWNEY's PROFILE 
Harry's Quidditch Cup victory innocent lasted for at least a week . 
Even the weather seems to celebrate ; June comes closer , the sky becomes more and more sultry ; And what everyone would like to do is take a stroll in the school yard and lie on the lawn with a lot of bottles of frozen pumpkin juice , then can play the Bi Xie Bum improvisation or look Squid swimming back across the lake . 
But children can not be so leisurely . 
The exams almost knocked them down , and instead of playing outside , they had to stay in the castle , trying to force the brain to concentrate , while the attractive summer hue poured through the door . The book provokes it . 
It was even seen that Fred and George were beginning their studies ; They are going to take the B . P . T . T . ( Regular Witchcraft ) . 
Percy is ready for the K . T . P . T . T . ( Examination of Magical Exercises ) , the highest level at Hogwarts . 
Because Percy hopes to be recruited into the Ministry of Engineering , he must strive to be first . 
Increasingly , he became irritated , punishing anyone who caused loud noises in the common room in the evenings . 
Actually , there was only one person who seemed more anxious about studying than Percy , which was Hermione . 
Harry and Ron had stopped questioning Hermione how she managed to study so many at the same time ? 
But when she looked at the schedule that she drew for herself , Ron and Harry could not control themselves . 
The first column of this schedule records : 
SECOND 9 hours , Arithmetic 9 hours , Lunch 1 hour , Charm 1 hour , Ancient Rune 
Today she was so nervous that she could burst out whenever she was disturbed . 
Ron hesitated : 
- Hermione ? 
Are you sure you record your schedule correctly ? 
Hermione held the examination and looked at her : 
- - What ? 
Well , of course I'm copying right . 
Harry said : 
- Do not know whether to ask you , how can you at the same time sit in two different examination rooms ? 
Hermione replied : 
- Do not ask . 
In both of you , did anyone see your Digital and Grammage ? 
Ron said in a low voice : 
- Yes , yes . 
I borrowed it to lull into bed . 
Hermione began to pile on the pile of parchment paper on her desk , searching for the book . At that moment , there was a rustling sound at the window and Hedwig flapping his wings , sucking on a letter . 
Harry opened the letter saying : 
- Letter from Hagrid . 
Buckbeak Trial - the date is set at 6 . 
Hermione is still looking around for the Arithmetic book , commenting : 
- That day was the day we finished . 
Harry still read the letter : 
- And people will come here to execute the judgment . 
One of the Ministry of Magic and ... and one hand . 
Hermione looked up , amazed : 
- - A dispatch to a pardon court ? 
So what if they have a ruling and then what ? 
Harry slowly said : 
- Yes , that's right . 
Ron roared : 
- - No way ! 
I have spent a lot of time reading the whole documentary about this case , they can not ignore it all ! 
But Harry had a terrible feeling that the Dangerous Goods Commission was manipulated by Malfoy and was forced to make a decision . 
Draco Malfoy , the loser after Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup , has regained some of its pomp over recent days . 
Through the scornful comments Harry heard , Malfoy was sure Buckbeak was about to be killed , and seemed to be completely satisfied with himself for causing that . 
At times like that , Harry just wanted to imitate Hermione in the middle of Malfoy's face , but he had to do his best to restrain himself . The most pressing thing for Harry , Ron , and Hermione is that they do not have the time or the opportunity to visit Hagrid . 
Very strict security measures have not been abolished , and Harry does not dare to take back his invisibility cloak beneath the witch's eye . 
o 0 o 
The examination began and the castle suddenly fell silent in an unusual way . 
The third - year students burst out of the examination room at lunchtime on Monday , their limbs tingling , their faces white ash , and they matched each other's answers , moaning , that they have never been so hard to do , that exam 
Including turning a teapot into a turtle . 
Hermione made the other contestants rape because of the sheer boredom of her little girl that her turtle looked more like a tortoise , and that would not bother anyone . 
- His trio still have the tail is the kettle , it is a nightmare ... 
- Do not know how the turtles have to exhale steam like a kettle ? 
- Our children have a turtle still green color of the porcelain pot , do not know if I lost points ? 
Then , after a quick lunch , the children went back up the stairs to the Charm School . 
Hermione turned out to be correct : Professor Flitwick indeed gave them the right Chance . 
Harry was too nervous to make too much of a posture , leaving Ron , the pupil with Harry , to laugh at himself so madly that he had to be taken to another quiet room for an hour , Then you can do your own thing . 
After dinner , students rush back to the common room , not to relax , but to begin reviewing the Mystical , Toxic , and Astronomy Care . 
Hagrid presided over the mysterious Creature Care exam the following morning with an anxious mood no other than the contestant , really . 
The spirit of his spirit did not appear to be in his body . 
He offered a freshly sterile tube to the class and told the contestants that they would pass the exam if they were to keep the sperm alive after an hour . 
Because Spices are healthy and fresh when they are kept in their own way , this is the easiest test that students have ever tested ; And also that Harry , Ron and Hermione have many opportunities to talk to Hagrid . 
He leaned close to Harry , pretending to check some of Harry's still - living Spirits , telling him , 
- Beaky is a little sad ... locked up too long . 
But anyway ... we know it's the day ... one way or the other . 
That afternoon they were taking poison , which was a complete disaster . 
Although Harry managed to keep his way , he still could not make the Pill , and Snape stood there looking at the heck of a hatred , then scrawled something that looked suspiciously like a goose egg . in his notebook , before stepping over to another student . 
At midnight , they went to astronomy , plucking the tallest tower of the castle . 
The History of Magic took place on Wednesday morning , during which he scrambled to write down all that Florentine Fortescue had told him about the medieval witch hunts , while it I wish to have a glass of raspberry ice cream in a room filled with stress . 
The fourth is the Herbal Medicine , in the glass house under the heat of the sun . 
Then came back to the living room again , with blistered thighs and thighs , hoping for the next day to shake , to finish the final course , for the long journey . 
Their final exam on Thursday morning was Dark Arts Defense . 
Professor Lupine came up with the most unusual test he had ever done : a form of outdoor obstacle course , where they had to wade through deep water ponds filled with sea monsters . Grindylow , then through a series of red - topped holes . and then shuffled through a swamp , no matter the direction of the Hinkypunk swamp , and then climbed into an old chest and fought with a new jumper . 
As Harry climbed out of the chest and grinned , Lupine whispered , 
- Excellent , Harry . maximum point . 
With this success , Harry stood around to watch Hermione and Ron compete : Ron crossed the paths pretty well until he reached Hinkypunk . 
This man succeeded in throwing fire to Ron's direction , causing him to sink deep into the marsh in the mud . 
Hermione is doing everything perfectly , until she arrives at the old chest with a cheek in it . 
After a minute in the chest , Hermione jumped out , crying . 
Lupine was surprised : 
- Hermione ! 
What's up ? 
Hermione gasped , pointing to the chest : 
- GiGiGi ... 
Professor McGonagall ! 
She said she also failed . 
It took a while for Hermione to reassure her . 
Finally , when she regained control , the three , Harry , Ron and Hermione , walked back to the castle . 
Ron still struggled to laugh at Hermione's Chuck , but the sight they saw on the steps of the castle upset all their arguments . 
On it , Cornelius Fudge , sweating in a striped cloak , was staring into the yard . 
He saw Harry and said , 
- Hi , Harry ! 
I guess you just finished it ? 
Are you ready ? 
Harry replied , 
- Yes , I'm going . 
Hermione and Ron were not happy to talk to the Minister of Magic , so he was embarrassed at the back . 
Mr. Fudge looked over at the lake and said , 
- - What a nice day ... 
What a pity ... pity ... 
He took a deep breath and looked down at Harry : 
- Harry , I came here for a mission that was not interesting at all . 
The Committee for the Elimination of Dangerous Animals requires the witness of a madcap driver's journey . 
And because we also need to go to Hogwarts to check on Sirius Black status , we were asked to attend the case . 
Ron stepped forward and said , 
- So that means that the pardon was done then ? 
Mr. Fudge looked at Ron curiously , and said , 
- No , no , that's just the beginning of the day . 
Ron said , 
- Then you probably do not need to witness any execution ! 
Equine may be pardoned ! 
Fudge did not answer Ron from the door of the castle behind him appeared two mages . 
One looks so old that he seems insignificant in the eyes of the children ; The other is tall and muscular , with a shallow black mustache . 
Harry guessed that they were representatives of the Committee for the Elimination of Dangerous Creatures , because the old mage glanced toward Hagrid's hut and said in a weak voice : 
" Oh ... oh my ... I'm so old but I have to do this ... " 
At two o ' clock , huh ? 
Fudge ? 
The man with black mustache searched his fingers for something in his waist . 
Harry looked and saw his big thumb along the edge of his sharp tongue . 
Ron opened his mouth to say something , but Hermione pinched it horizontally and nodded toward the lobby . 
When they went into the Great Hall for lunch , Ron was angry : 
- Why are you bothering me ? 
Do not you see them ? 
They even have hammered grinding ready ! 
This is unfair ! 
Hermione was very upset , but she said , 
- Ron , your dad worked at the Ministry of Magic . 
You can not talk in such a voice with your boss . 
At this trial , until when Hagrid still held his head upright and rightfully argued , they could not execute Buckbeak . 
But Harry could see that Hermione did not really trust her . 
Around them , people are excited to eat and chat , happy to see that the exam will end this afternoon , but Harry , Ron and Hermione are indulged in the grief of old Hagrid and Buckbeak , so . I did not bother . 
Ron's and Harry's final exams are Prophets , and Hermione is a Muggle - type student . 
The three of us went up the marble stairs together . To the first floor , Hermione separated , only Ron and Harry moving up to the seventh floor , where many of the students were sitting on the stairs leading up to Trelawney's study room , trying to go to school . the last minute . 
As Harry and Ron sat down next to Neville , he announced , 
- She will meet each other separately . 
Neville was about to open his Book of Illuminated Tiles on his lap at the page about crystal ball contemplation . 
He asked the two of them with melancholy : 
- Do you ever see anything in the crystal ball ? 
- - No problem ! 
Ron replied in a low voice . 
He looked at the wrist watch . 
Harry knew Ron was counting every minute until Buckbeak's appellate judgment . 
The line outside the classroom is slowly lining up . 
Whenever a child climbed down the silver stairs , the rest of the group asked , 
- What do you ask ? 
Can you answer ? 
But they all refused to disclose anything . 
As Neville climbed down the ladder , he reached for Harry and Ron was sitting , hissing , 
- She told me the crystal ball told her , if I told you , I would have a terrible accident ! 
Ron and Harry had already reached the top of the stairs . 
Ron snorted : 
- Too comfortable ! 
You know , I began to think that Hermione was right about her ( pointing her finger at the trapdoor above her head ) . 
She was a spoiled old man . 
Harry looked at his watch , now it was two o ' clock , it agreed : 
- Ừ . 
Bridging the hastily to the hilt ... 
Parvati climbed down the stairs with a proud face . 
She told Harry and Ron : 
- She said I have all the signs of a Charismatic . 
I see a lot of things ... Oh , good luck ! 
She climbed down the stairs to Lavender . 
From above they came down to the familiar mysterious voice : 
- Ronald Weasley ! 
Ron frowned at Harry and climbed up the silver stairs and out of sight . 
Now only Harry was the last one to enter the contest . 
He sat down on the floor , leaning back against the wall , listening to the sound of a fly humming through the sunlit window , his mind crossing the schoolyard to Hagrid . 
Finally , after twenty minutes , Ron's massive foot appeared on the stairs . 
Harry stood up and asked : 
- - Star ? 
Ron replied : 
- Garbage ! 
I did not see any dry monkey , so I made up . 
But do not know whether she believes ... 
Professor Trelawney called : 
- Harry Potter ! 
Harry whispered to Ron : 
- See you in the living room . 
The room on the top of the tower was hotter than ever , the curtains were pulled down , the fire in the furnace blazed , and the unpleasant odor that made Harry cough as he stumbled across the benches . lurking on the path leading to Professor Trelawney - she was waiting for him in front of a large crystal ball . 
She said quietly : 
- Welcome ! 
Please look at this crystal ball ... 
Now let's go ... then tell me what's in it ... 
Harry leaned close to the globe and gazed , staring at all the concentration he could get , asking the ball to show him something other than the fog , but no what happens 
Professor Trelawney urged him gently : 
- - Star ? 
What do you see ? 
The heat overwhelmed Harry and his nose was gloomy because of the smoke smelling of perfume from the fireplace beside the two teachers . 
Harry thought about what Ron had said , and decided to scream . 
It says : 
- Uh ... a dark shape ... 
sound ... 
Professor whispered Trelawney : 
- What is it ? 
Now think about it ... 
Harry rummaged his mind and caught Buckbeak . 
She said firmly : 
- . 
The professor scrawled on the parchment to open it on her knees , whispering : 
- - right ! 
My son , maybe you ' ll soon see Hagrid's troubles with the Ministry of Magic ! 
Take a closer look ... Is the Code of Appearance appearing again ? ... 
its not ? ... 
Harry states : 
- Yes , still ! 
Professor Trelawney persuaded : 
- Are you sure ? 
Are you sure , baby ? 
Do not you see it writhing on the ground , maybe , and a ballooned high behind it ? 
- Yes , no ! 
Harry began to feel sick . 
Professor Trelawney continues : 
- There is no blood ? 
Did not see Hagrid cry ? 
- - Are not ! 
Harry insisted on saying no , in the desire than ever to get out of this room and escape this heat . 
- - Equal Number of stars ... 
he flies ... 
Professor Trelawney sighed : 
- Well , dear , she thought we paused there ... a little disappointed ... but I suppose I did my best . 
Harry sighed with relief and stood up , carrying his briefcase and turning his back on it , but suddenly a shrill voice was heard behind him : 
- That will happen tonight . 
Harry turned around . 
Professor Trelawney has become stiff in her armchair ; Her eyes widened and her mouth dropped . 
Harry said : 
- - Dear teacher ? 
But Professor Trelawney did not seem to have listened to Harry . 
Her eyes began to circle . 
Harry stood there in panic . 
She looked horrified as if she were in a seizure . 
Harry was so confused , thinking of running down the stairs to ask for help ... but then Professor Trelawney said , also in a loud , loud voice , not like her usual voice : 
- Dark Lord is lying alone lonely , abandoned by his disciples . 
His followers have been in chains for twelve years . Tonight , before midnight , his servants will be free and will seek revenge . 
The Dark Lord will rise again with the support of his followers , which will be greater and more terrible than ever . tonight ... 
Before midnight ... subordinates ... please subdue the Master . 
Professor Trelawney's head fell to his chest . 
She heard a strange sound like a stink . 
Then , suddenly , her head looked up . 
Professor Trelawney said dreamily : 
- Sorry to hear you . 
Heat of the day , you know ... I take a nap ... 
Harry stood there , still staring . 
- What's wrong , baby ? 
- She ... she just told me ... 
The Dark Lord is about to rise again ... His subordinates will return to his henchmen ... 
Professor Trelawney was absolutely amazed : 
- The Dark Lord ? 
Who knows who it is ? 
Baby , that's not a joke ... to wake up ? ... 
- But she just said that ! 
She said Dark Lord ... 
- I think maybe you have already had a little nap , dear . 
I certainly did not dare to predict something so imaginative like that ! 
Harry climbed down the ladder and twisted stairs wondering wonderfully ... 
Did he just hear Professor Trelawney say a real prophecy ? 
Or is it your idea of ​​ an impressive exam finish ? 
Five minutes later , Harry hurried through the security dwarf guarding the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower , and Professor Trelawney's words remained beaked in his head . 
The other students were swiftly crossing it in the opposite direction , laughing , joking , throwing out , eager for the freedom they longed for . 
When Harry was in front of Mrs. Beo's portrait and walked into the common room , the room was almost empty . In one corner , only Ron and Hermione sat . 
Harry gasped for the two of them : 
- Professor Trelawney just told me ... 
But it stopped suddenly when Ron and Hermione looked at each other . 
Said Ron weakly : 
- Buckbeak lost . 
Hagrid sent this . 
Hagrid's letter was not dry at first , but his hands were trembling as he wrote , so much so that his writing was hard to read : 
No amnesty . 
They will execute at sunset . 
You can not do anything . do not come down 
I do not want to see that scene . 
Uncle Hagrid . 
Harry said , 
- We have to act . 
He can not sit there alone waiting for the plan ! 
Ron stared out the window with a look of disgust . 
- Anyway ... sunset ... 
We can not live without you ... especially you , Harry ... 
Harry collapsed his head in his hands , thinking : 
- If we have a cloak jacket ... 
Hermione asked : 
- - Where is it ? 
Harry told her that he had hidden the invisibility cloak in the corridor below the witch's eye . 
It says : 
" If Snape finds himself lurking around again , I may be in trouble . " 
Hermione stood up , saying : 
- - right . 
If Snape sees you ... 
How do you open the hump on the witch's back ? 
Harry said : 
- You just knocked on it and said : Dissendium . 
But ... 
Hermione did not need to wait for Harry to finish his sentence ; She crossed the room across the room , pushed Mrs. Beo's portrait , and disappeared . 
Ron looked at Hermione , saying , 
- Hermione went to get the invisibility cloak ? 
right . 
Fifteen minutes later , Hermione returned to the silver - plated coat carefully hidden inside her robes . 
Ron said , 
- Hermione , I do not know what the hell happened to you ! 
At first Malfoy Bodhisattva , then you leave the class of Professor Trelawney ... 
Hermione seemed to be flattering to the clouds . 
o 0 o 
The three children went down to the Great Hall to eat like everyone else , but then they did not return to Gryffindor Tower . 
Harry hid the invisibility cloak beneath the front of the slacks he was wearing , and folded his arms to cover the coat was raised up . 
They 
Sneak into the empty room outside the lobby , listen to the static , until it is clear the lobby is empty . 
They heard the last few people rush past , then the door sounded strong . 
Hermione poked her head out to look around . 
She whispered : 
- - OK . 
There is nobody outside this ... 
Dress up 
Walking side by side so that no one could see , three tiptoes under the cloak passing through the hallway , then down the stone steps , across the courtyard . 
The sun dives behind the Forbidden Forest . 
They came to the door of Hagrid's hut and knocked . 
A moment later Hagrid opened the door , and when he opened the door , he looked around for the guest who knocked on the door with a pulsating look and trembling body . 
Harry whispered : 
- We are here . 
We are wearing invisibility cloak . 
Uncle us in the house to us to take off his jacket . 
Hagrid grunted : 
- You should not have come here ! 
He said so , but he stepped back , and they stepped into the house . 
Hagrid hurried the door and Harry removed his invisibility cloak . 
Hagrid did not cry , nor did he embrace them . 
He looks like a man not knowing where he is , not knowing what to do . 
This helpless helplessness is more tragic than tears . 
He asked . 
- Drink some tea ? 
His huge hands trembled when he picked up the tea pot . 
Asked Hermione , 
- Where is Buckbeak ? 
Hagrid poured all the milk on the table when filling the vase . 
He said , 
- Uncle ... I take it out to play . 
It was stuck in his pumpkin garden . 
I think he should see the forest and ... breathe fresh air ... before ... 
Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jar fell out of his hand and burst on the floor . 
He sat down , putting his sleeve on his forehead . 
- The other milk in the cabinet . 
Hermione said , 
- for you to do , Hagrid . 
She quickly bent down to clean the bottle . 
Harry glanced at Ron , and Ron looked back helplessly . 
Harry sat down next to him , asking earnestly : 
- Is there no other way , Hagrid ? 
Dumbledore ... 
Said Hagrid . 
- You have tried . 
You do not have the authority to govern that commission . 
You told them Buckbeak was all right , but they were afraid ... They knew Lucius Malfoy was the kind of person he was ... he scared them , he was sure ... the executioner , Macnair , is an old friend of Malfoy ... but he is also fast and neat ... and he will be with him ... 
Hagrid swallowed . 
His eyes fluttered around the hut , as if searching for some hope or consolation . 
- Dumbledore will come down here when that ... that happened . 
I wrote to him this morning , saying he wanted to ... want to be with him . 
Dumbledore was a great man . 
Hermione rummaged through Hagrid's cupboard to find another bottle of milk , leaving a choked and short cough . 
She found the new bottle , stood up straight , trying to squeeze the tears . 
She said : 
" We ' ll be with you , Hagrid . " 
But Hagrid shook his shaggy head : 
- You must return to the castle . 
Uncle told me , I do not want you to see . 
And you are not allowed to come down here anyway ... 
If Mr. Fudge and Dumbledore catch you out of the castle without permission , Harry , you will be in trouble . 
Tears were still streaming down Hermione's face , but she tried to hide Hagrid by mugging tea . 
Suddenly , as she was picking up a bottle of milk , she cried out : 
- Ron ! 
I ... 
I can not believe it ... scrabbers here ! 
Ron gasped at Hermione . 
- What are you saying ? 
Hermione brought the new bottle to the table and knocked it down . 
With a screeching panic and a frenetic effort to climb in , Scrabbers still slid off the table . 
Ron exclaimed , 
- Scarbbers ! 
Scrabbers ! What are you doing here ? 
Ron grabbed the mouse trying to fight and then brought it to the light to look carefully . 
The Scrabbers looked horrible . 
It was a lot worse than ever , the large feather fell off revealing bald patches , and it struggled in Ron's hand as he tried desperately to free himself . 
Ron patted : 
- No head , Scrabbers ! 
There is no cat ! Nothing here harms you ! 
Hagrid stood up suddenly , his two eyes looking out the window . 
His normal rosy face suddenly became gray as an old parchment . 
- They are coming ... 
Harry , Ron and Hermione ran to stand around Hagrid . 
A group of men are walking down the stone steps of the castle in the distance . Dumbledore's forehead , the silver beard of the light reflecting the feeble light of the sun is setting . 
Lon ton next to him is Mr. Cornelius Fudge . Behind them were the Commission Member , Macnair . 
Hagrid's whole body was shaking , and he said to the three children , 
- You must go immediately . 
Do not let them meet you here ... go now ... 
Ron slipped the Scrabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the invisibility cloak . 
Said Hagrid . 
- to guide the children to the back . 
They followed him through the door to the garden . 
Harry had a very strange feeling , and he felt even more illogical when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away , pinned to a tree behind Hagrid's pumpkin garden . 
Buckbeak also seems to know something is going on . 
He kept turning his sharp head from one side to the other , and stomped on the ground nervously . 
Hagrid said softly : 
" It's okay , Buckbeak . 
It's okay ... 
He turned to Harry , Ron and Hermione said : 
- - scat . Go ahead . 
But the three of them did not budge . 
- Hagrid , we can not ... 
- We will tell them what really happened ... 
- They can not kill it ... 
Hagrid became fierce : 
- - go ! Without them and the trouble , the situation is bad enough ! 
Three little children have no choice . 
When Hermione unleashes an invisible cloak over Ron and Harry , they hear voices in the front door of the hut . 
Hagrid looked at where they had just disappeared . 
He said hoarsely . 
- Go ahead . do not have to eavesdrop 
And he strode back into the hut when someone knocked on the front door . 
Slowly , as if in a state of hypnosis , Harry , Ron and Hermione quietly walked around Hagrid's hut . 
When they went round the front of the hut , the front door closed . 
Hermione whispered : 
- Please hurry , I can not take it anymore , can not bear it ... 
They started going up the slope of the lawn , toward the castle . 
At this moment the sun was falling down very quickly , the sky was turning into a light gray , but the west was up red . 
Ron stood dead , Hermione begged : 
- Oh , Ron , please ... 
" That Scrabber ! " 
It does not ... lie still ... 
Ron leaned down , trying to keep Scrabbers in his pocket , but the rat was becoming irritated , chirping like crazy , twisting , turning , trying to tap into Ron's invisible teeth . 
Ron squealed : 
- Scrabbers ! 
I'm here ! idiot , I'm Ron ! 
The door behind them opened , and his voice came out . 
Hermione sobbed : 
- Oh Ron , please go . 
They are going to be executed , I can not stand it ! 
- Oh , come on ! 
Scrabbers , lying still ... 
They come forward ; Harry , like Hermione , tried not to hear the shrill voices behind them . 
But Ron stood again . 
- I can not keep it ... 
Scrabbers , shut up , everyone will hear us ! 
The rat was screaming like a madman , but it was not big enough to overwhelm the hopelessness of Hagrid's garden . 
From there a bunch of vague voices were heard , then silence , and then , without warning , a whistling sound and a thud of the hammer . 
Hermione staggered in place . 
She whispered to Harry : 
- They did it ! 
I can not believe it ... they do it again . 
Chapter 17 
TIPS , LIGHTS AND DOLLARS 
Harry's mind went blank because of the intense emotion . 
The three children stood dumbfounded under the invisibility cloak . 
The last rays of the sun are scattered on the ground with shadows darkened with blood . 
And then , the kids heard behind them a wild howl . 
- Uncle Hagrid ! 
Harry muttered . 
And without a moment considering what he was doing , Harry spun around , but both Ron and Hermione held onto his arm . 
Ron was as white as paper , saying : 
- We can not do anything . 
If they knew we were going to see him , he would just have more trouble . 
Hermione's breath was just short . 
She choked : 
- - Do ... 
star ... 
that ... 
they can ... ? 
How can they do that ? 
Ron patted his teeth and hit : 
" Oh , shut up , Hermione . 
They returned to the castle , walked slowly together to be covered under the invisibility cloak . 
The sunset is now off very quickly . 
When they reached the empty pitch , the darkness was covering all around . 
Ron rubbed one hand against his chest , hissing : 
- Scrabbers ! 
Stay still ! 
The mouse was still struggling . 
Ron stopped abruptly , trying his best to put the mouse in his pocket : 
- What are you suffering from , stupid rat ? 
Are you still OUCH ! 
It bites me ! 
Hermione pleaded : 
- Ron , for a moment ! 
Mr. Fudge will come right now ... 
- It does not bear ... lying still ... 
Apparently Scrabbers were scared . 
He was struggling with all his might to get out of Ron's tight grip . 
- What is it ? 
But just then Harry saw Crookshanks - his body pressed against the ground , his golden eyes flashing sharply in the darkness , and the animal was huddling toward them . 
Harry could not tell whether the cat could see them , or just follow the scrabble . 
Hermione moaned : 
- Crookshanks ! 
No way , go elsewhere , Crookshanks ! scat ! 
But the cat is approaching ... 
- Scrabbers ! DO ! 
Too late . 
The rat slipped out of Ron's clenched fists , fell to the ground and ran wildly . 
With just one leap , Crookshanks followed closely behind the mouse , and before Hermione or Harry could stop him , Ron threw his invisibility cloak away to run in the dark . 
Hermione moaned : 
- Ron , Ron ! 
She and Harry looked at each other , then sprinted to Ron . 
Invisibility cloaks can not run fast ; Two children took off , and the shirt fluttered behind them like a flag . 
They could hear footsteps running in front and Ron screaming Crookshanks : 
- stay away from it ... go away ... 
Scrabbers , come back here . 
A loud thud sounded loudly . 
- You got it ! 
Get out , the cat outbreak ... 
Harry and Hermione almost fell on Ron . 
They win in front of Ron's face . 
Ron was crawling on the ground , but also caught the Scrabbers in the bag . 
Her hands held a shiver in her pocket . 
Hermione gasped : 
- Ron , stop it ... get back invisibility cloak . 
Dumbledore ... the minister ... they are about to come out for a while ... 
But before they were able to cover themselves , not breathing , the crowd heard the murmur of the huge clawed feet . 
Something is heading towards them in the dark : a giant black dog , with gray eyes . 
Harry pulled out his wand , but it was too late . 
The dog launched a great leap and clawed its way into Harry's chest . 
Harry fell backwards under a bunch of curls , felt the dog's warm breath and long teeth to two feet . 
But the power of the jump caused the dog too much momentum , it pushed Harry to roll over . 
Shocked and felt as if all the ribs were broken , Harry tried to stand up ; hear the dog growl as if it is playing around preparing another attack . 
Ron got up . 
When the dog returned to them , Ron pushed Harry aside ; So the dog took Ron's arm outstretched . 
Harry fumbled , grabbed a feather of the beast , but the beast ripped Ron away as easily as he could to pull a rag doll . 
Then , out of nowhere , something hit Harry's face so hard it got crushed to the ground . 
He heard Hermione hissing in pain and falling as well . 
Harry fumbled for the wand , blinking his blood , and whispered , 
- Lumos ! 
The light of the wand helped Harry see the trunk of a large tree . 
So they chased the Scrabbers and ran down the canopy and the branch of the tree was creaking like a thunderstorm ; Flip over , knock backwards so they do not get closer . 
And right under the tree was the dog , he was dragging Ron back to a large hole in the tree roots - Ron was resisting fiercely , but his head and body still slipped out of Harry's eyes . 
- Ron ! 
Harry screamed , trying to follow him , but the heavy branches stumbled into the air in the air , forcing Harry to step back . 
Now Harry and Hermione only see one of Ron's legs poking out . 
Ron had hooked that leg to the roots in an effort to fight the dog so it was not dragged down to the ground . 
Suddenly a sound of gunfire sounded ; Ron's leg was broken , and only a blink then , Ron's feet also disappeared . 
Cried Hermione : 
- Harry ! 
We have to go to the rescue ! 
The baby was bleeding , Willow Roi had her shoulders tilted . 
Harry said : 
- - Did not make it in time ! 
Not enough time , Ron will be swallowed now ... 
- But there is no help we can not do anything ... 
Another branch twisted down two young children , its small branches clutched like fist clutches . 
Harry avoided the other party , gasped and said , 
- If the dog does not make it , then we can go too far . 
He tried to splinter through the fierce branches of the pestilence , but he could not get close to the roots of the tree for a moment without being knocked out by the branches . 
Hermione jumped on the spot , whispering like mad : 
- - Oh ... 
assist ... 
assist ... 
Please ... 
assist ... 
Crookshanks cat came forward . 
It bends like a serpent , sneaks through the branches of the tree , and then puts a foot up on a trunk of the tree . 
Immediately , the whole tree was turned into marble , stopped moving immediately . 
Even a leaf does not budge . 
Hermione whispered : 
- Crookshanks ! 
Now she gripped Harry's arm , clinging to the pain : 
- How did he know ... ? 
Harry states : 
- It is a friend of that dog . 
I saw them go together . Let's go , you've got your wand in your hand . 
It only took a few seconds to reach the roots , but before they reached the hole , the Crookshanks swirled around like a broom scouring its brush , and made it in . 
Harry followed soon . 
It crawls forward , heads in front , slipping down a ramp to the bottom of a very low tunnel . 
Crookshanks was a bit away , his eyes flashing from the flames of Harry's wand . 
A few seconds later , Hermione slipped down beside Harry . 
She whispered in a frightened voice : 
- Where is Ron ? 
Harry crouches after Crookshanks , replying to Hermione : 
- go this way . 
Hermione followed Harry , still short of breath . 
- Where does this tunnel lead ? 
- - I do not know ... 
It was struck in the map of the hijackers , but Fred and George said no one ever was . 
It is missing at the edge of the map , but it seems to lead to Hogsmeade ... 
They tried to go as fast as they could , almost bending their bodies , in front of them they were Crookshanks ' tail when hidden . 
The tunnel went on and on , Harry felt it was as long as the tunnel leading to the Secret Duke . 
Now , there's only Ron in Harry's head , what the dog can do Ron ... 
Harry had a sprint , sighing in short bursts of pain in his chest . 
And then the tunnel began to rise , a short distance from the winding road winding , and Crookshanks lost . 
Instead of the cat in front , Harry saw a faint light flicker through a small gap . 
He and Hermione paused , gasping for breath , then went forward . 
Both raised their wands to see what was over there . 
It was a room , a messy and dusty room . 
The wallpaper was peeled off , all over the floor rubbed rubbish rubbish , all furniture and furniture were broken , as if someone was smashed . 
And all the windows are covered with boards . 
Harry glanced at Hermione , who looked scared , but nodded . 
Harry squeezed through the hole , his eyes wide . 
The room was empty , but the door on the right was open , leading to a dim corridor . 
Again , Hermione grabbed Harry's arm suddenly . Her big eyes were swirling around a window that was clogged with planks . 
She whispered : 
" Harry , I think we're in the Shit . " 
Harry looked around . 
His eyes met a wooden chair nearby . 
Many wooden bars have been broken and one leg completely knocked out . 
Harry slowly said : 
- Ma can not do that ! 
At that moment , there was a crack on top of them . 
Something moves up the stairs . 
Both looked up at the ceiling . 
Hermione's hand clasped Harry's arms so tightly that Harry could not hear his fingers anymore . 
He raised his eyebrows at Hermione , and she nodded and let go . 
Silently , they crawled into the corridor , then climbed onto a nearly ruined staircase . 
Everything was covered with thick dust , except the floor . 
On the floor there is a fairly large clean dusty trail created with something pulled up the stairs . 
Two times to the top of the stairs I'm dark . 
- Nox . 
The two whispered to each other , and the light at their wand tip turned off . 
There is only one door open . 
When they reached the open door , they heard something moving behind the door . 
A deep moan , then a deep groan . 
The two exchanged the final look and the final nod of agreement . 
Holding the wand in his hand , Harry kicked the door open . 
On a magnificent bed , there are four mosquito nets with dusty blinds hanging , Crookshanks lying down , seeing that they are loud . 
Besides , lying on the floor , hugging the broken leg to form a strange angle , is Ron . 
Harry and Hermione crossed the room , to Ron : 
- Ron ... 
Do you ? 
- Where is the dog ? 
Ron gritted his teeth in pain , groaning : 
- Not a dog . 
Harry , that's a trick ... 
- - What ? 
- The dog is him , he is a Animal Witch . 
Ron's eyes glared over Harry's shoulder . 
Harry swung around . 
With a bang , the man in the dark closed the door behind them . 
The smelly , filthy hair on his two elbows . 
If his eyes do not shine in two deep sockets , he may think he is just a dead body . 
The skin looks like wax , stretching on the face , just like a skull . 
And his golden teeth are blurring out into a smile . Y is Sirius Black . 
Black pointed Ron's wand at the children , his voice clattering : 
- - Expelliarmus ! 
Harry and Hermione's wands fluttered out of their hands , flew into the air , and Black was captured . 
Black then stepped closer . 
His eyes stared at Harry . He said : 
- I thought that you have to come here to help your friend . 
His voice sounded like he had no habit of spending hours talking . 
- My father used to do it for me . 
I belong brave , do not run away teacher teacher . 
I'm very thankful ... this will make things much easier ... 
The comments about his father echoed in Harry's ear , as if Black roared in his ear . 
The fierce hatred erupted in its chest , leaving within it no place for fear to hide . 
For the first time in his life , Harry wants to take the wand in his hand , not for self - defense , but to attack ... , to kill . 
Unaware of what he was doing , Harry rushed forward , but suddenly there was a man beside him , and his arms clutched to him , pulling him back . 
- do not , Harry ! 
Hermione whispered in a whisper . 
However , Ron told Black : 
" If you want to kill Harry , you should kill both of you ! " 
Ron's voice was very strong , though trying to stand up made it more pale , and his mind was spinning as he spoke . 
There is something burning in Black's eye . Y said softly to Ron : 
- Lie down . 
You ' ll make the wound worse . 
Ron still clung to Harry in pain to try to sit up straight , he said in a weak voice : 
- Do you hear ? 
You will have to kill all three of us . 
But Black laughed , saying : 
- Tonight there will be only one person killed . 
- - Why so ? 
Harry croaked his scorn , trying to escape the hold of Ron and Hermione : 
- Last time you were not concerned about the number of people killed , huh ? 
He did not even bother with all those Muggles to kill Pettigrew ... 
What is the matter , hell ? 
Azkaban made him so easy ? 
Said Hermione shakily : 
- Harry , shut up . 
Harry roared : 
- I THOUGHT THAT ME ! 
With a great deal of effort , Harry escapes Ron and Hermione's clumsiness , and rushes forward . 
He forgot how thin he was , how small he was , and thirteen , while Black was a tall man . 
It just needs to know that it wants to make Black damage so badly that it does not matter how bad it can be . 
Perhaps because of the fact that Harry was acting too stupid , or something unknown , Black did not raise his wand at that moment . 
One of Harry's hands catches Black's useless wrist , forcing the tip of his wand to deflect , Harry's fists clench fondly at Black's tangle and they both fall back , touching the wall . . 
Cried Ron , screaming loudly ; a dazzling glare as Black's wands shot into the air with a spike of smoke , piercing Harry's face in the hairline . 
Harry felt his arm clench between his fingers struggling like crazy , but he clung to his grip , and the other punched him wherever he could . 
Black's other hand caught Harry's throat . Y hissed : 
- - Are not . 
I have been waiting so long ... 
The fingers tightened , Harry choked , his glasses deflected to one side . 
Then he saw one of Hermione's feet not knowing where it came from . 
Black let out a sigh , let go of Harry . 
Ron also clawed at Black's hand and Harry heard a small click . 
He struggled up from the chaos and saw his wand rolling on the floor . 
She threw herself at the wand , but ... 
- AAA ! 
Crookshanks also had a great deal of torment , the large forearms of the big cat clutching Harry's arm . 
Harry threw it out , but the Crookshanks now rushed to Harry's wand . 
Harry roared : 
- DO NOT BE HAPPY ! 
He aimed a kick at Crookshanks to make the cat sideways , panting . 
Harry grabbed his wand and turned around . 
She screamed to Ron and Hermione : 
- Stay away ! 
The other two did not wait for the second time . 
Hermione , open mouth to breathe , lips bleeding , crawl to the side , snapshot of his wand and Ron . 
Ron crawled to the bed and poured on it , gasping for breath , his white face now blue , both hands clutching his broken leg . 
Black lies mango waves under the foot of the wall . 
His flattened chest fluttering as he watched Harry slowly step closer , Harry's wand pointed right at Black's heart . 
Black whispered : 
- Are you going to kill me , Harry ? 
Harry stood over the Black . 
Its wand still pointed at Black's chest , and it looked down at Black . 
A bruise wound appears around his left eye socket and his nose is bleeding . 
Harry said in a shaky voice , but still held the wand in his hands : 
- He killed my parents . 
Black stared at Harry with deep eyes . He said very quietly : 
- I do not deny it . 
But if you know the whole story ... 
Harry's ear snarled at the resounding resentment , repeating it : 
- The whole story ? 
I just knew he was the one who sold my parents to Voldemort ! 
Black says , in his voice , there is an urge : 
- Listen to me . 
I will regret if you do not listen ... I do not understand ... 
- I understand more than you think . 
Harry said , his voice shaking now more than ever : 
- Have you never heard my mother begging ? 
My mother ... tried to stop Voldemort from killing me ... he did not know ... he sold my parents ... 
The two did not even say a word , there was something orange passing over Harry . It was Crookshanks who jumped on Black's chest and sat there , right in the heart of Black . Y blinked at the cat . Y tried to push Crookshanks out , rumbling with it : 
- Get out ! 
But Crookshanks still clawed at Black's robes , refusing to budge . 
The cat's ugly face flattened toward Harry , his big yellow eyes staring at it . Standing beside Harry , Hermione burst into sobs . 
Harry leaned down and stared at Black and Crookshanks , his hands clutching his wand . 
What if it also killed the cat ? 
Cat on the side with Black ... 
If Crookshanks was trying to protect Black from being infected , it was not Harry's job . 
If Black wanted to save the cat , it would only mean that he would care for the life of the cat more than the lives of his parents . 
Harry raised his wand . 
Now is the time to get justice . 
Now is the time to revenge for her parents . 
He is about to kill Black . 
He must kill Black . This is a chance for revenge . 
The seconds were long , and Harry stood still as if frozen , the wand was ready , and Black gazed at it , and Crookshanks was thrust into Black's chest . 
From the bed , Ron breathed out the breath . 
Hermione was completely silent . 
Suddenly a new noise emerged ... 
Footsteps are echoing through the floor - someone is walking down the street . 
Hermione screamed suddenly : 
- - We are here ! WE ARE HERE - SIRIUS BLACK - MAUCH ! 
Black made a startling move , croaking Crookshanks down to the ground . 
Harry gripped his wand , his hands trembling . 
A voice in his head sounded : 
- Act now ! 
But the footsteps echoed on the stairs , which Harry had not yet acted upon . 
The door to the room opened in a red sparks . 
Harry swung around as Professor Lupine burst into the room , his face no longer a drop of blood , his wand was ready . 
He looked , from Ron lying on the floor , to Hermione who was hugging the door , then Harry stood there with his wand pointing to Black , and then Black was collapsing and shedding blood at Harry's feet . 
Professor Lupine shouted : 
- - Expelliarmus ! 
Grabbing Harry's wand once more from his hand ; Two wands in Hermione's hands too . 
Lupine cleverly took hold of his socks , then stepped into the room , staring at Black , who was still crouching on his chest for protection . 
Harry stood there , suddenly feeling empty . 
It did not do that . 
It does not have enough metronome . 
Black would be handed over to the Azkaban dictator . 
Then Lupine spoke , in a strange voice , a trembling voice of repressed emotions : 
- Sirius , is he ? 
Harry looked up at him immediately . 
He did not understand what Lupine meant ? 
Who is Lupine talking about ? 
He turned to look at Black . 
Black faces almost no emotion . He did not move in seconds . 
Then , very slowly , Black held up a bare hand , and pointed at Ron . 
Stunned , Harry glanced at Ron , who was also astonished by what he did . 
Lupine stared at Black with a strangled look as if to read his mind : 
- But then ... why did not he show up before ? 
Unless ... 
Lupine's eyes widened , as if he had just seen something behind Black , something the other people in the room could not see : 
- - unless he is the one ... unless we change the role ... do not tell me ? 
Black's dark eyes did not leave Lupine's face , so slowly , he nodded . 
Harry cried out loudly : 
- Professor Lupine , what are ... ? 
But it never uttered the question , because what it saw made her voice clog in her throat . 
Lupine lowered his wand . 
Then , going to Black's side , he clenched his fist , pulling him up , causing Crookshanks to fall to the floor , and then hugged Black as if hugging his brother . 
Harry felt as if his gut fluttered . 
Shouted Hermione : 
- I do not know ! 
Lupine let go of Black and turned to her . 
Hermione stood up and pointed to Lupine , her eyes wild , she stammered : 
- Master ... 
master ... 
- Hermione ... 
- Master ... and he ... 
- Hermione , calm down ... 
Cried Hermione : 
- And yet I did not tell anyone ... so I have kept the teacher secret for so long ... 
Lupine shouted : 
- Hermione , please listen to me ! 
Can you explain ... 
Harry felt his whole body shivering , not because of fear , but because of a new wave of indignation . 
She yelled at Lupine , his voice trembling uncontrollably : 
- I trusted you ! 
Yet he has been friends with him for so long ! 
Lupine said : 
- I misunderstood . 
You have not been friends with Sirius for twelve years , but now ... let me explain ... 
- DO NOT ! 
Cried Hermione . 
- Harry , do not believe him , he has helped Black to break into the castle , he also wants you to die ... 
He is a werewolf ! 
A long silence . 
Everyone's eyes were on Lupine , and he was still very calm , though a little pale . 
He said : 
" Hermione , not everything is as standard as mine . " 
I'm just about a third what you say is true . 
He did not help Sirius break into the castle , and he certainly did not want Harry dead . 
A strange shudder glimpsed through his face : 
- But he did not deny that he was a werewolf . 
Ron tried again courageously to sit up , but fell back with a groan of pain . 
Lupine approached him , anxious , but Ron thumped : 
- Get away from me , the werewolf ! 
Lupine stood silent . 
Then , with a clear effort , he turned to Hermione and said , 
- How long have you known that ? 
Whispered Hermione : 
- - It's along time . 
From the moment I wrote the essay that Professor Snape asked ... 
Lupine said calmly : 
- Snape would be very pleased . 
He made that suggestion in hopes of recognizing my symptoms . 
Do you check the moon cycle to see if I'm always sick at full moon ? 
Or did you notice that Kung Fu became the moon when he saw me ? 
Said Hermione quietly : 
- - Both . 
Lupine laughed : 
- You are the smartest witch in the age you've met , Hermione . 
Hermione whispered : 
- I do not deserve that praise . 
If I was more intelligent than a little , then I told everyone who I was . 
Lupine said : 
- But everyone knows it already . 
At least the teacher council knows . 
Ron breathed panting : 
" Did Dumbledore know he was a werewolf , who also took him to school ? " 
How crazy ? 
Lupine said : 
- Some teachers think so . 
He is also very difficult to convince some teachers that I trust ... 
Harry screamed : 
- AND THERE WAS DRUNK ! YOU ALWAYS ALWAYS HELP ! 
She pointed at Black . He reached for the bed and lay on it , his face trembling hands . 
Crookshanks jumps up and lies next to Black , lifting his leg to his thigh , hissing . 
Ron pounded his broken leg away from Black and the cat . 
Lupine said : 
- I have not been helping Sirius for a long time . 
If you give him a chance , he will explain . 
See this ... 
He separates the wand from the three children and throws the tree back to the owner . 
Harry snapped his wand , stunned . 
Lupine wiped his wand at his waist . 
- that ! 
Now you are armed , and we are not . 
So do you listen ? 
Harry did not know what to think . 
Is this a lie ? 
He glanced at an angry look at Black and said , 
" If you did not help him , how would you know him here ? " 
Lupine said , 
- Thanks to the map ! 
Map of the hackers . 
Teacher is sitting in his office to see the map ... 
Harry asked suspiciously : 
- Do you know how to use it ? 
Lupine waved his hand impatiently : 
- Of course you know how to use it . He contributed to writing it . 
He is a dumb dreamer - that is the nickname his friends gave him when he was still in school . 
- wrote him ? 
" It is important , in the afternoon , that you are scrutinizing the map , because you have the idea that you are , Ron and Hermione can try to sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before the Equinox . Code executed . 
And he was right , right ? 
Lupine began to walk around , looking at the children , the patch of dust in his footsteps . 
- Harry , maybe you put on your old coat ... 
- How do you know about your father's coat ? 
Lupine again waved his hands again : 
- Countless times I saw James disappear under the shirt ... 
The problem is that even if you wear an invisibility cloak , you will still be on the map of the hijackers ! 
He watched the children go across the school grounds and into Hagrid's hut . 
Twenty minutes later , the children left Hagrid's house , went back to the castle . 
But you have an escort . 
Harry exclaimed : 
- - What ? 
No , no more accompanying anyone ! 
Lupine still walks , no matter how interrupted she is , he continues : 
- Master can not believe in his eyes . 
He thought the map was technically malfunctioning . 
How could he come with you ? 
Harry said : 
- No one comes with us ! 
- And then he saw another dot , moving very quickly towards the children , named Sirius Black ... 
He saw him clash with the children , then he dragged two of the children into the cave under Willow Roi ... 
Ron's main anger : 
- One person only ! 
Lupine said : 
- - Are not . 
Ron , two people . 
He stopped walking , looked at Ron . 
He calmly said : 
- Would you agree to show me the mouse a bit ? 
Shouted Ron : 
- - What ? 
Scrabbers mice have nothing to do with this ? 
Lupine said : 
- Talk to everything ! 
Please let me see it a bit . 
Ron hesitated , then reached into his robes . 
Scrabbers appear , struggling desperately . 
Ron had to hold onto the rat's tail to keep from running away . 
Crookshanks stood up on Black's lap , giving a small hiss . 
Lupine approached Ron more . 
It seemed as if he kept breathing as he stared at the Scrabbers . 
Ron grasped the Scrabbers and took it closer to him , seeming frightened . 
Ron asked again : 
- - Star ? 
What's wrong with my mouse ? 
Sirius Black suddenly said , 
- It's not a mouse . 
- What do you want to say ? 
Of course it's a mouse ... 
Lupine calmly said : 
- No , it's not a mouse . 
It is a witch . 
Black added : 
- A peturizer , a disguised witch named Peter Pettigrew . 
Chapter 18 
LUNCH , FISH , COTTON , AND DUCK 
It took a few seconds , the nonsense of the words that soaked into the ears of the children . 
Then Ron uttered what he was thinking : 
- Both are mental ! 
Said Hermione weakly : 
- - Funny ! 
Harry said : 
- Peter Pettigrew is dead ! 
Twelve years ago he killed him . 
Harry points to Black , his face twitching violently . Y growled with yellow teeth blazing out : 
- I was going to do that . 
But Pettigrew was a bit taller than me . 
However , this time it is different ! 
And Crookshanks was knocked to the floor by the Black Scrabbers , and Ron screamed in pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg . 
Lupine shouted : 
- Sirius , DON ! 
He rushes forward and once again pulls Black out of Ron . 
- PLEASE ! 
You can not do that . 
Kids need to understand ... 
We have to explain ... 
Black found the way out of Lupine's hands , grumbling : 
- We can explain later ! 
One of Black's hands was still in the air as if trying to capture Scrabbers . 
The rat squealed with fear , heard the echoes like a pig , and screamed Ron's neck to find a way out . 
Lupine tried to hold Black , and said in a sudden breath : 
- The - young - have - right - to - know - everything - stuff ! 
Ron has kept it as a pet for a long time ! 
And there are parts of the story that I myself have not understood yet ! 
And Harry - you owe Harry the truth , Sirius . 
Black stopped struggling , though his keen eyes were still staring at the Scrabbers , the wretched creature clutching Ron's grip and bleeding hands . 
Black says , his eyes still do not leave Scrabbers : 
- - Okay . 
Just tell them whatever you like to say . 
But hurry up , Remus . 
I want to carry out the murder that made me imprisoned ... 
Ron looked around for the support of Harry and Hermione , trembling , 
- You are crazy . 
I see this is enough . 
I'm going . 
He tried to lift himself up to the broken leg , but Lupine held up his wand and pointed the wand at the Scrabbers . 
He said calmly : 
- You will have to hear the story , Ron . 
Just grip Peter when he listens . 
Shouted Ron . 
- IT IS NOT PETER , IT IS SCRABBERS ! 
Ron tried to stuff the mouse in his pockets in front of his chest , but the Scrabbers tried to resist . 
Ron staggered and lost his balance , Harry had to catch it and push it back down on the bed . 
Then Harry turned to Lupine , not looking 
Black . 
- Many witnesses have seen Pettigrew die . 
A road full of people ... 
Black cut off the words , eyes still watching the Scrabbers boxed in Ron's hands : 
- People do not see what they think they see . 
Lupine nodded . 
- Everyone thought Sirius killed Pettigrew . 
I believe so ... until I looked at the map this evening . 
Because the map of the thief is not cheating ... 
Peter is still alive . 
And Ron was holding it , Harry . 
Harry looked at Ron , their eyes met and they both agreed , silently : both Lupine and Black were gone mad . 
Their story is ridiculous . 
How could Scrabbers be Pettigrew ? 
The Azkaban Prison probably finally made Black crazy , but why did Lupine follow him ? 
Suddenly Hermione spoke , in a trembling voice , and tried to keep herself calm , as if she were trying to make Lupine speak out for the chopsticks : 
- But Professor Lupine ... 
Scrabbers can not be Pettigrew ... that's not true , you know that's not possible ... 
- Why can not it be true ? 
Lupine asked in a calm voice , as if these two teachers were discussing the lecture in the classroom , and Hermione had just raised a problem with the Grindylows experiment . 
" Because ... because one must know , if Pettigrew was an Animal Witch . " 
We practiced Animal Transformation in class with Professor McGonagall . 
And I looked up when I did the homework ... 
The Ministry of Magic compiles records of witches and wizards that can transform animals . 
There is a record of what turns them into beasts and their own traits and traits . 
I looked up to see Prof . McGonagall in the civil registration section , when I saw that there were only seven witches in this century , and no Pettigrew in that list . 
Harry had no time to be so secretly amazed at Hermione's effort that she poured in her work . 
But Lupine began to laugh : 
- Hermione ! 
Come right again ! 
But the Ministry never learned that there had been three unregistered Animal Witches still running around Hogwarts . 
Black is still watching the Scrabbers ' desperate movements , grumbling : 
" Remus , if you're going to tell them the whole story , then tell me . " 
I have been waiting for twelve years , I will not be able to wait any longer . 
Lupine said : 
- okay , Sirius ... 
But you also need to help me . 
I just know how it started ... 
Lupine stopped abruptly . 
There was a loud crash behind him . 
The bedroom door opened itself . 
Five people in the room glared at the door . 
Then Lupine strode towards the door and looked down at the top of the stairs . 
- - Nobody else ... 
Said Ron : 
- This place is haunted . 
Lupine looked at the door in confusion . 
He said : 
- There are no ghosts . 
This tent is not haunted ... 
The howls and howls the villagers used to hear were from me . 
Lupine threw his lock of gray hair so that they would not cover his eyes , thinking for a moment , and said , 
- that is the beginning of the whole story ... starting from where I became a werewolf . 
If I did not have a werewolf , this would not happen ... and if I did not risk it ... 
He looks a little calm and a bit tired . 
Ron tried to say something , but Hermione was " hushed " it shut down . 
She was watching Lupine very seriously . 
- When I was bitten by a werewolf , I was still a baby . 
My parents tried all sorts of remedies , but at that time there was no treatment at all . 
The medicine that Snape prepared for me was a recent invention . 
You should also understand that it does not make me dangerous . 
As long as I take medication about a week before the full moon , I can keep clear and calm in the process of transformation ... 
I could just curl up in my office , in harmless wolves , waiting for the moon to deflated . 
However , before the time of the vaccine was invented , once a month I turned into a monster full of beast . 
It was almost certain I could not get into Hogwarts . 
Parents of other children do not seem to want to let their children come in contact with me . 
But then Dumbledore became Principal , and he was very sympathetic . 
He said that if we had some preventive measures , there was no reason why I could not go to school . 
Lupine sighed . 
Then he looked straight at Harry : 
- Months ago , you told me that Willow Roi was planted the right year when you went to Hogwarts . 
The fact is that the tree was planted because he went to Hogwarts . 
This house ... 
Lupine looked at the room mournfully . 
- ... the tunnel leads here ... the building is for me to use . 
Once a month , I have to sneak out of the castle , to this place , to transform the wolf . 
The tree was planted right at the entrance to the tunnel to prevent anyone from meeting me when I was being dangerous . 
Harry could not understand where this story would lead , but it was always listening intently . 
Besides the voice of Lupine's story at the moment in the room only mice chuckled in shock . 
- My transformation at that time was ... horrible . 
Transforming into a very painful werewolf . 
I was separated from humans to not bite them , instead , I had to scratch myself and bite myself . 
The people of Hogsmeade heard the noise and the screams , and they thought they heard the evil spirits of evil spirits . 
Dumbledore also encouraged the story to spread rumors ... 
Up to now , when the house has become quiet for many years , the villagers still dare not come near it ... 
But apart from being transformed into a werewolf , those days were happier than any other time in my life . 
Because for the first time in my life there are friends , three great friends . 
Sirius Black ... 
Peter Pettigrew ... and of course the third one is James Potter , my dad , Harry . 
Then my three friends could not help but notice that I disappeared once a month . 
I made up the whole thing . 
I told them my mother was sick , that I had to go home to visit her ... 
I was frightened by the thought that my friends would shun me when I knew who I was . 
But , of course , they are like me , Hermione , they also discover the truth ... 
And they do not alienate me at all . 
On the contrary , they do something to help me , making my transformation not only more tolerable but also the happiest moment in my life : they also transformed into animals . 
Harry was amazed : 
- Three children ? 
Lupine said : 
- Yes , that's right . 
They spend most of their time in the three years trying to figure out how to transform . 
My father and Sirius are the brightest students in the school . 
And they are lucky too . 
Because animal formations can turn out to be horribly horrible - that's one of the reasons the Ministry of Magic must strictly control the transposition trials . 
Peter needs help from Sirius and James . 
Finally , on the fifth academic year , my friends succeeded . 
Each of them can turn into an animal as you like . 
Asked Hermione , doubtful : 
- But how does that help you ? 
Lupine said : 
- My friends can not be with me in my life , they are friends with me under the beast . 
A werewolf is dangerous to humans . 
My friends sneaked out of the castle once a month , hiding under the invisibility cloak of James . 
They transformed ... 
Peter is the youngest person , can be jostled through the branches of Willow Roi rampant beatings to reach the trunk that twists the knot " points point " tree . 
Then they crawled down the tunnel and came here with me . 
Thanks to their influence , I became less dangerous . 
My body still wolf , but there are friends next door should my mind less savagely . 
Black still stared at the Scrabbers with a scary look on his face . 
He grumbled : 
- Just go to Remus . 
- I'm going to talk about it , Sirius . 
Oh ... so exciting possibilities opened up when we all could transform . 
Soon , we not only hid in the Hut , wandering around the school grounds and in the village at night . 
Sirius and James transformed into big animals so they could control my wolf man . 
I dare say that none of the Hogwarts students ever discovered anything more about the school and Hogsmeade than we did . 
And from that , we can go into the map of the pirates , and sign it with our nickname . 
Sirius is the Stuffed Legs . 
Peter is the worm's tail . 
James is Guan Deer . 
- What kind of animal ? 
Harry had just begun to ask was interrupted by Hermione . 
- That is still very dangerous ! Wander around in the night with a werewolf ! 
What happens if you get out of control and miss someone ? 
Lupine said , 
- A thought keeps on haunting me . 
Many people are nearly bitten , and then we just make fun of it . 
We are young , wild heartless thought ... is absorbed in the wisdom of his . 
" Of course , sometimes I feel sorry for Dumbledore's credit . " 
You admitted me to Hogwarts when no other principal was willing to do so . 
And she did not know what I had violated the rules that she set out for my own safety and that of others . 
I did not know that I had opened the way for three friends to transform into animals illegally . 
But every time we come to the table for adventure next month , I try to forget my guilt . 
And I still do not change ... 
Lupine's face was solid , and in his voice as self - loathing : 
" For the whole of this year , I have always struggled with myself , wondering if I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was a Animal Witch . 
But I did not do that . 
Why ? 
Because I'm too cowardly . 
To do so would mean confessing that I had taken the trust of my older brother while he was still in school , admitting that I had asked others to follow me . 
Dumbledore's faith meant everything to me . 
You let me go to school at Hogwarts when I was little , and then he gave me a job , when I was shunned throughout my adult life , not earning a living wage just because of the disease I had . . 
And so I convinced myself that Sirius Black broke into school by using the Dark Arts he had learned at Voldemort , but being an Animal Witch had nothing to do with it . . 
So , in a way , what did Snape say about me ? 
Black took his eyes off the Scrabbers for the first time in a few minutes , staring at him , looking up at Lupine , asking in a harsh tone : 
- Mr. Snape ? 
Mr. Snape , what's up with this ? 
Lupine grimly replied : 
- Snape here , Sirius . 
He teaches at this school . 
Lupine looked at Harry , Ron and Hermione and said , 
- Professor Snape was in our school at the same time . 
The photo fiercely challenged me to appoint a black anti - art teacher . 
The photo told Dumbledore throughout the year that I was not credible . 
Photo of reason ... 
You know , Sirius used to play Snape , a monster that almost killed him , but that cheat is also my contribution to one hand ... 
Black mumbled a mocking tone . Y : 
- For the life . 
Who yelled , stalking to find out what they are planning to conspire ... the hope for us expulsion ... 
Lupine continued to say to Harry , Ron and Hermione : 
- Severus is very interested in where I go each month . 
We study the same year , you know that too , and we ... 
uh ... not very well liked 
James especially offensive . 
I think just because of James ' talent at Quidditch Stadium ... 
Anyway , one afternoon Snape saw Miss Pomfrey leading me across the schoolyard towards Willow Roi to transform me . 
Sirius thought it would be interesting if the picture told Snape that the photo was just a long stick on the trunk on the tree as the photo could follow me . 
Well , of course , Snape try ... 
If it was too far away from the house then the picture would meet a full werewolf ... but my dad , who had heard about Sirius , hurriedly followed Snape , pulled the picture back . , although it would be risky to do so ... 
Anyway Snape also saw me at the end of the tunnel . 
Dumbledore banned the photo from revealing it to anyone , but from that moment on , the picture became known to me as well . 
Harry slowly spoke up : 
" So that's why Snape did not like you ? " 
Master Snape thinks he's involved in that hoax ? 
- - right ! 
A cold voice scorned from the wall behind Lupine . 
Professor Snape took off his invisibility cloak , his wand pointing directly at Lupine . 
Chapter 19 
your daughter from Voldemort 
Cried Hermione . 
Black stood up . 
Harry jumped up as if shocked . 
Snape snapped his stealth cloak aside , carefully keeping the wand's head pointed straight at Lupine's chest : 
- I found this under the Willow Roi . 
That useful item , Potter . 
I thank you ... 
Snape's voice was a little gasp , but his expression was filled with the joy of suppressed triumph . 
He said , glinting eyes : 
- Perhaps you are wondering how do I know you are here ? 
I just came to your office , Lupine . 
I did not drink the medicine tonight , so I brought a cup full of him . 
And fortunately I did ... I mean , it's good for me . 
Lying on your desk is a map . 
Just glance at that I know everything I need to know . 
I saw him running down the corridor and then disappeared . 
- Severus ... 
Lupine opened his mouth , Snape's throat stopped : 
I said again to the principal that he continued to help his old Black friend break into the castle , and this is proof , Lupine . 
I can not even imagine what you used this shabby place as a hideout ... 
Lupine urges : 
- Severus , you're wrong . 
I have not heard everything ... I can explain ... 
Sirius does not come here to kill Harry ... 
Snape's eyes flashed hysterically : 
- Added two Azkaban innocent people tonight . 
I would love to see how Dumbledore handled this . 
But he was harmless , he knew that Lupine ... a werewolf was tamed . 
Lupine whispered : 
- - You are so stupic . 
Was it a bit of a bad time to study so well that he was able to put an innocent innocent Azkaban ? 
HAPPY ! 
Ripples like snakes suddenly fell from Professor Snape's wand and then bent around Lupine's mouth , elbows and ankles , causing him to lose his balance , falling to the floor , Can not budge anything . 
With an angry roar , Black rushes toward Snape , but Snape points his wand directly between Black's eyes . 
He whispered : 
- Give us an excuse . 
Just move me to have an excuse , and I swear I will hand . 
Black stood dead . 
The two faces are confused , it is hard to say which face expresses more hatred than any face . 
Harry stood there , numb , not sure what to do or should believe . 
He glanced at Hermione and Ron . 
Ron was as confused as he was , and still struggled to keep the Scabbers in danger of dying trying to escape . 
However , Hermione was reluctant to take a step toward Snape and said in a harsh voice : 
- Professor Snape , listen ... 
Listen ... what they're about to say is not bad , right ... right ? 
Prof . Snape : 
- Miss Granger , you are facing the risk of being expelled from this school . 
She and Potter and Weasley crossed the line , leaving the party with a murderer and a werewolf . 
Can you try once in a lifetime to shut up ? 
- But if ... what if there is a mistake ? 
- IM , YOUNG PEOPLE ! 
Snape shouted , his expression suddenly mad . 
- DO NOT SAY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ! 
A few sparks from the end of the chopsticks still pointed toward Black . 
Said Hermione . 
Snape breathed in Black's face : 
- The revenge is very sweet . 
I have longed for so much that I will be the one who will catch you ... 
Black : 
- He was playing again , Severus . 
Black nodded at Ron : 
- When the kid brought the rat back to the castle ... I would still be quiet ... 
- to the castle ? 
Snape said softly : 
- I do not need to go that far . 
As soon as we get out of the Willow Roi we call the dementors of Azkaban . 
They will be happy to see you again , Sirius Black ... so happy that you will kiss me , I dare say so ... 
Black face cut off blood . He said : 
- You ... you must hear me say . 
Mouse ... 
Look at the mouse ... 
But in Snape's eyes there was a fury of light that Harry had never seen before . 
Snape looked like he had no reason . 
He snapped his fingers , the ropes of the rope that bound Lupine to his hands . 
He said : 
- let's go , all the flies ! 
I will drag the werewolf . 
Maybe the Azkaban dementors will kiss him too . 
Unaware of what he was doing , Harry crossed the room with three long steps , standing in front of the door . 
Snape's teacher : 
- Get out of the way , Potter , you got enough trouble ! 
If we are not here to save our lives ... 
Harry said : 
- Professor Lupine has the opportunity to kill hundreds of children during this school year . 
You have been alone with me many times when you were taught self defense against the Azkaban dementors . 
If Lupine and Black were together , why did not he kill her then ? 
Snape snapped . 
- Do not tell me to learn the way of thinking of a werewolf ! 
Get away , Potter ! 
Harry screamed : 
- THANK YOU ! ONLY FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT FOR A SCHOOL , WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN ... 
Snape looked more crazy than ever , he hissed : 
- - SHUT UP ! DO NOT TELL ME THROUGH THE RING ! It's just like that , Daddy , Potter . 
I just saved my life , should have to kneel thanksgiving I have to . 
If he killed the game then it is worth living ! 
You will die like the father of the game , so proud that you can not believe that I can mistake Black ... 
Now avoid the way for me , or I will make the game avoid . BREAKTHROUGH , POTTER ! 
Harry decided in half a second . 
Before Snape could take another step toward it , Harry raised his wand : 
- - Expelliarmus ! 
Harry screamed ... but that was not the cry of it alone . 
A loud blast shook the door on the hinges , Snape was lifted off the floor , splashed into the wall , then slipped down to touch the floor , a fresh blood gushed out under his hair . 
Snape fell unconscious . 
Harry looked around . 
Both Ron and Hermione tried to disarm Snape's weapon just as Harry tried to do it . 
Snape's wand sped up a curve and landed on the cot next to Crookshanks . 
Black looked at Harry , 
- You should not have done that . 
You should let the guy let you ... 
Harry avoided Black's eyes . 
Even now , it is unlikely that it did the right thing . 
Hermione looked at Snape's frozen body with terrifying eyes , mournful sobs : 
- We attacked a teacher ... I attacked a teacher ... 
Oh , we're going to get into trouble ... 
Lupine was trying to get out of the rope that was tied around him . 
Black hurriedly bent down to untie him . 
Lupine straightened up , rubbing his wrist with the wire tied deep . 
He said : 
- Thank you , Harry . 
Harry backs up : 
- I have not said that you believe me ! 
Black says : 
- Then it was time for us to show him some evidence . 
Baby , give Peter this . Take it now . 
Ron grasped the Scrabbers close to his chest . 
It says weakly : 
- - Stop it ! 
Did you say that he escaped Azkaban to escape just to reach for the Scrabbers ? I meant to say ... 
Ron looked at Harry and Hermione for support : 
" Well , let's assume Pettigrew can turn into a rat ... but there are millions of mice ... " 
How could he know if he was locked in the Azkaban dungeon ? 
Lupine turned to Black , grinning slightly , saying : 
- Sirius , you understand , that's a reasonable question . 
How do you know him ? 
Black stuck a hand like a dog in his robes and pulled out a crumpled newspaper . Y straightened out and showed it to everyone : 
- That picture of Ron and his family was published in the Prophet's Summer last summer , and on Ron's shoulder sat Scrabbers . 
Asked Lupine , 
- How did you get this ? 
Black says : 
- Thanks to Fudge . 
When he came to inspect the Azkaban dungeon last year , he gave me the newspaper . 
And I saw Peter , on the first page ... on this little guy ... I recognized him right away ... 
How many times have I seen him transform that rat ? 
And the photo caption says he's going back to Hogwarts ... where Harry is studying ... 
Lupine stared at Scrabbers , then at the newspaper , then at Scrabbers . 
Teacher whispered : 
- - Oh my God ! 
Swipe it first ... 
Asked Ron stubbornly : 
- What about it ? 
Black says : 
- He lost a finger . 
Lupine exhaled : 
- Sure , too simple ... too smart ... 
He cut a finger on his own ? 
Black says : 
- Just before his transformation . 
As I cornered him , he screamed out to the streets to hear that I had betrayed Lily and James . 
Then , before I could stop him , he blasted the path with his wand hidden behind him , killing everyone within seven meters around him ... and down the drain with the other mice . . 
Lupine said : 
- Have you ever heard , Ron ? 
Pettigrew's most intact body was found just one finger . 
- But , Scrabbers probably lost a foot claw because it was fighting with other mice or something . 
It has been in my family for a long time , really ... 
Lupine said : 
- yes , those twelve years . 
Have you ever wondered why it lived so long ? 
Said Ron : 
- We ... we take good care of him ! 
He said : 
- But this time it does not look good good general ? 
I guess he started losing weight when he heard Sirius Black was outside the law ... 
Ron nodded at Crookshanks , still lying on his bed : 
- Only at mad cats makes it so scary ! 
But that's not true , Harry suddenly thought ... 
Scrabbers are sick before they even meet Crookshanks . 
It began to languish from Ron back in Egypt ... , from Black escape prison ... 
Black reached out his bony hand and patted the head like a baby's hair 
Crookshanks , husky said : 
- This cat is not crazy . 
It's the smartest cat of all time I've ever seen . 
He realized Peter was the type to pretend instantly . 
And when he met me , he knew I was not a dog . 
It takes me a while to trust me . 
Finally I found a way to inform him that I was searching for something , and from there he relayed to me ... 
Cried Hermione : 
" What do you mean by that ? " 
- It tried to get Peter to hand me , but unfortunately did not ... so he steals the password to the Gryffindor Tower for me ... as far as I understand it has stolen the password paper to on the bedside table of a child ... 
Harry's brain seemed to sink under the weight of what he had just heard . 
It's ridiculous ... but ... 
" But Peter was guessing what was going on , so ran away ... this cat , I call it Crookshanks , right ? 
He said that Peter had left the blood on the sheets ... 
I guess Peter had bitten himself ... 
Well , once again fabricated fake death for yourself ... 
These words shook some thoughts in Harry's mind . 
He asked angrily : 
- But why is it supposed to die ? 
Because he knew he was going to kill him like he killed my parents ? 
Lupine said : 
- no , Harry ... 
- And now he comes to finish his life ! 
Black throws a scowl to Scrabbers , saying : 
- Yes , I have to kill it . 
Harry yelled : 
" Then I might have to let Snape get you to go ! " 
Lupine said hastily : 
- Harry , do not you understand ? 
For a long time we thought Sirius betrayed his parents , and Peter showed his face ... but the story turned out the opposite , do you understand ? 
It was Peter who betrayed his parents ... and Sirius was hunting Peter ... 
Harry screamed : 
- - Incorrect ! HE IS A SECRETARY OF MY THREE PEOPLE ! HE SAID BEFORE YOU LEAVE THESE , THAT YOU HAVE HEARED THREE HEADS ! 
Harry points to Black , shaking his head slowly ; Then his deep sunlight shone brightly . He said : 
" Harry ... I might as well have killed them . " 
Because I had advised Lily and James to use Peter as a secretary instead of me ... 
I know I'm wrong ... 
On the night they were killed , I was about to check Peter to make sure he was safe , but when I got to his hideout he was gone . 
But there was no sign of a fight . 
I feel not fine . 
I am scare . 
I immediately went straight to my parents ' house . 
And when I saw the house was destroyed , the bodies of three children ... 
I realized that Peter would have done it . 
And understand what I must do ... 
Black's voice broke , he turned away . 
Lupine said : 
- - Such is enough . 
In Lupine's voice there was a chilliness that Harry had never heard before : 
- There is only one surefire way to prove what really happened . 
Ron , give that mouse . 
Asked Ron anxiously . 
- If you give it to the teacher , what will you do ? 
Lupine said : 
- Forcing it to reveal the truth . 
If it was really a mouse , it would not matter . 
Ron hesitated , until a moment later he brought the Scrabbers out , Lupine grabbed the mouse . 
He began to whistle , chirping constantly , twisting his head , turning back and forth , his tiny black eyes protruding over his head . 
Lupine asked : 
- Ready , Sirius ? 
Black had picked up Snape's wand on the bed . He approached Lupine , approached the rat who was struggling , and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to burn . 
Black quietly said : 
- Together , huh ? 
Lupine said : 
- I think so . 
Lupine grasped the Scrabbers in one hand , while the other held the wand . 
- I count to three to go hand out . 
One two Three ! 
A bright blue light flashed from both ends of the wand ; At that moment , the Scrabbers were frozen in the air , and his black body writhed wildly . 
Ron screamed ... and the mouse dropped to the floor . 
Another light flashes and then ... 
It's like watching a fast - moving picture of a growing tree : first , a head jutting out of the floor , legs and limbs sprouting out , then a man standing up where the Scrabbers had fallen Down , he twisted his wrist twisted hands . 
The Crookshanks snarled and sniffed the nostrils on the bed , the feathers on his back standing upright . 
That little man , taller than Harry and Hermione , had a faint , faded hair , with a bald patch on top of his skull . 
He has the shape of a huddle who is suddenly fatal sudden weight loss in a short time . 
His skin was filthy , almost like the Scrabbers ' skin , and some of the remains of the mouse still fell around his spiky nose and small eyes . 
He looked around at everyone , his breath short and dry . 
Harry saw his eyes darting toward the door . 
Lupine said happily , as if the rat's outburst of mice was a common occurrence around him : 
- Ah , hello Peter . 
Long time no see him . 
Eyes were still staring at the door , Pettigrew said , even the sound of his voice sounded like a rat : 
- - Brother ... 
S ... 
Sirius ... 
Brother R ... 
Remus ... You old ... 
You my ... 
Black's wand held up , but Lupine held onto Black's wrist , his eyes on Black's warning , and turned toward Pettigrew , Lupine's voice calmly calm : 
" Peter , we have had a little conversation , about what happened on Lily and James's death . 
Maybe he missed a few good points when he was busy chirping around on the bed ... 
Harry could see the sweat in his pale , pale face . 
He gasped : 
- Remus , you do not believe him , are you ? 
He tried to kill me , Mr. Remus ... 
Lupine said coldly , 
- We also heard that . 
Mr. Pettigrew , I want to clarify a few minor issues with you , if you are too ... 
Pettogrew squeaked abruptly , pointing at Black , and Harry noticed that he was using his middle finger , for the index finger was dead . 
- He came here to try to kill me again ! 
He killed Lily and James and now he wants to kill me ... Remus , please help me ... 
Black's face looks like a long head ever since he glared at Pettigrew from deep , bottomless eyes . 
Lupine said : 
- No one tried to kill him , until the matter came out . 
Pettigrew squealed . 
- Where are you going ? 
Once again Pettigrew looked pensive , his eyes pounding at the bent windows , then at the door : 
- I know he will hunt for me ! 
I know he came back for me . 
I have been waiting for this for twelve years . 
Lupine's eyebrows scowl , he asked : 
- You know Sirius will destroy Azkaban ? 
When no one has ever done that before ? 
Pettigrew shrieked , 
- He has the ability that people like us can only dream of . 
How did he get out of Azkaban ? 
I'm sure Everyone knows that somebody taught him some tricks ! 
Black started laughing , the terrible mournful laughter filled the room . He said : 
- Voldemort teaches us tricks ? 
Pettigrew cowered as if Black had just hit a whip hit him . 
Black said , 
- - Star ? 
Afraid to hear your old boss name ? 
I do not blame you , Peter . 
His fists and limbs are not happy with you , right ? 
Pettigrew breathed more than ever . 
His face was all shiny now . 
He murmured : 
- I do not understand ... what do you want to say , Sirius ... 
Black says : 
" Twelve years ago you did not hide from me , you escaped from Voldemort's clique . " In Azkaban , I heard it all , Peter ... 
They are dead , but you have to answer them . 
I heard them screaming in the sleep . 
It sounded like they thought they were cheating on them . 
Voldemort reached the Potter home because of the information you provided ... and Voldemort was so badly beaten . 
Not all of Voldemort's clans were put to death in Azkaban , right ? 
There are still piles around here , pretending that they are enlightened , corrected the rules ... 
But if they hear the news you're alive , Peter ... 
Pettigrew said again , his voice barely visible : 
- do not know ... what are you talking about ... 
He wiped his face and looked up at Lupine : 
- You do not have this news , this crazy thing , not you Remus ... 
Lupine said fairly : 
" I must confess , Peter , that I misunderstood the reason why an innocent person wanted to live a rat for twelve years . 
Pettigrew squealed : 
- Innocent , but frightened ! 
If Voldemort's clique hunted me , it was because I had ensnared Azkaban , one of the most powerful of them - the spy Sirius Black ! 
Black face distorted . Y , suddenly heard as the sound of a dog with the stature of a bear : 
- How dare you slander ? 
Tao , is that spy for Voldemort ? 
Have I ever sung with anyone who is stronger or more powerful than me ? 
But you . 
Peter ... I will never understand why I did not realize you were a spy right from the start . 
You always love to fight with big friends who can protect you , right ? 
At that time these people were us ... me , Remus ... and James ... 
Pettigrew wiped his sweaty face , almost gasping for breath : 
- I ... a spy ... you must be insane ... no way ... do not know why you can say such a thing ... 
Black shrieked so venomously that Pettigrew took a step back : 
- Lily and James have chosen you as the secret keepers just because I offer so . 
I thought it was a perfect plan ... east east click ... 
Voldemort will definitely chase me ... so he does not expect Lily and James to keep secrets in a weak man like you ... 
It would be great in your miserable life , the best moment is when you get a card with Voldemort that you can hand over the Potter family to him . 
Pettigrew murmured madly ; Harry listened to sounds like " exaggerated " , 
" It's crazy , " but it can not help noticing Pettigrew's pale face , and the way his eyes keep pushing toward windows and doors . 
Hermione said timidly : 
- Professor Lupine , son ... I'd like to say , okay ? 
Professor Lupine politely said : 
- Of course , Hermione . 
- ... 
Scrabbers ... I mean , the man ... he had been sleeping in a bedroom with Harry for three years . 
If he is the one who knows who he is , then why did not he ever find a way to harm Harry ? 
Pettigrew squealed , shrugging a hand at Hermione , 
- that ! 
Thank you ! 
Do you see , Remus ? 
I never harmed a hair on Harry's head ! 
Why should I do that ? 
Black says : 
- I ' ll tell you why . 
Because you can not do anything for anybody unless you can see that is good for you . 
Voldemort had to die for 12 years , rumors that he was dead . 
You have nothing to do with a murder in front of Dumbledore's nose just to serve the remnants of a witch who has lost his power , right ? 
You just want to come back to him when you know he's sure he's a great singer in a wanderer , right ? 
Why do you have to go into a family of witches to hide ? To hear the news , Peter ? In case your old boss regains enough power , then you will be safe to surrender . 
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed his mouth several times . 
It seems he has lost the ability to speak . 
Hermione said timidly , 
- Mr. Black ... Mr. Sirius ... 
Black jumped up when he was called and kept staring at Hermione as if to be polite as he had long forgotten . 
- If you do not mind , I ask , how do you ... that escape the Azkaban prison if you do not use Dark Magic ? 
Pettigrew nodded to Hermione , 
- that's right ! 
Thank you ! that's what i ... 
But Lupine made him shut his mouth with a look . 
Black turned to Hermione slightly frowning , but not bothered by the question , which seemed to weigh the answer . 
Then Black said slowly : 
- I do not know how I did it . 
I think the reason I'm not crazy is because I know I'm innocent . It was not a fun thought , so the Azkaban dementors could not suck it out of me ... That thought helped me stay awake and know who I was ... and help me stay strong . mine . 
So when ... too much endurance ... I made myself a dog ... in the cell . 
The dementors Azkaban can not see ... you know ... 
Black swallowed , saying : 
- The Azkaban dementors only tracked the human direction with the ability to judge human emotions . 
When I was a dog , they judged my emotions very poorly ... less human , less complicated ... but , of course , they thought I was 
Demented as everyone else is imprisoned in them , so they do not mind anymore . 
But I was weak , very weak , and there was no hope of chasing them away from me when I did not have a wand . 
Then I saw Pettigrew in that picture ... 
I realized that he was at Hogwarts with Harry ... 
If there was a signal to his ears that the Dark side was reinforcing ... then he was in a very favorable position to act . 
Pettigrew was shaking his head , his mouth unspoken , his eyes wide with Black glinting all the time as if hypnotized . 
- ... ready to strike at the very moment he is sure to have an ally ... to hand over the last of the Potter to them . 
If he surrendered to Harry , who would dare say he was a traitor to Voldemort ? 
He will be accepted on the rank of honor ... 
So , I have to do something . 
I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive . 
Harry recalled what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley : 
- The guards said he kept talking in his sleep ... always the same words ... " He's at Hogwarts . " 
- As if someone had lit a fire in my head that the Azkaban dementors could not put it out ... it was not a happy feeling ... it was a phobia ... but It gives me strength , it makes my mind clear . 
So one night , when they opened the door to bring food , I sneaked past them like a dog ... 
They are very confused because they are much more difficult when judging sentient beings ... 
In a doggy , I was very sick , so sick , so sick that I could squat through the prison ... 
I swim back to the mainland like a dog ... 
I went back upstairs and sneaked into the Hogwarts yard like a dog ... 
Since then I have lived in the Forbidden Forest ... except one time I went to see the Quidditch match , of course ... I fly as good as my old father , Harry ... 
Black looked at Harry's eyes , he did not turn his face away . 
Black said , 
- - Trust me . 
Trust me . 
I never betray Lily and James . 
I would rather die than betray my life . 
And finally , Harry believed him . 
The throat choked back , Harry nodded . 
- do not ! 
Pettigrew fell as if Harry's nod was a death sentence for him . 
He lay on his knees , prostrate to the ground , his hands folded in front as he prayed : 
- Sirius ... I'm here ... I'm Peter ... my friend here ... I can not ... 
Black kicked one , Pettigrew panicked back : 
" You have not touched me yet , it was dirty enough . " 
Pettigrew turned back to Lupine , writhing his petition in front of him , his voice chanting loudly : 
- Remus ! 
You do not have this news ... 
Sirius has never told him about the couple's plans to change ? 
Lupine said : 
- He said otherwise I thought I was a spy . 
Said Lupine . 
Fluttering over Pettigrew's head in a dry voice : 
- I think that's why you did not tell me , Sirius ? 
Black says : 
" Forgive me , Remus . 
Lupine threw up his sleeves and said , 
- No , you old man legs stuffed . 
And you , you forgive me for doubting you are a spy ? 
The ghost of a fleeting smile on Black's haggard face : 
- - Of course . 
Black also began rolling up his sleeves . 
- Do we kill him ? 
Lupine decisively : 
- - Yes , I think so . 
Pettigrew gasped . 
Then he fumbled to Ron : 
" Ron ... we used to be good friends ... I'm your gentle pet . " 
You do not let them kill me , Ron , you ... you take me to you ! 
But Ron gazed at Pettigrew with horror . 
It says : 
- So I used to let you sleep on my bed ! 
Pettigrew crawled toward Ron : 
- Nice boy ... you kindhearted man ... do not let them kill me ... I'm your mouse ... I'm a gentle pet ... 
Black said sarcastically . 
" If you make a rat as kind as a human , then there's nothing worth boasting about , Peter . " 
Ron was pale with pain , trying to get his leg broken out of Pettigrew's reach . 
He turned on his knees and dragged himself to Hermione and grabbed her dress : 
- Nice girl ... smart girl ... 
she ... 
Do not let them ... you save me ... 
Hermione pulled her lap out of Pettigrew's tight - lipped hands , backed up to the wall , looking frightened . 
Pettigrew was still kneeling on the ground , trembling unsteadily . 
He turned his head slowly toward Harry : 
- Harry ... 
Harry ... you look like your father .... 
I like him very much ... 
Black roared : 
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE HARRY ? HOW DO YOU LOOK AT IT ? HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT JAMES BEFORE IT ? 
Pettigrew knelt to Harry , his hands reaching out , whispering : 
- Harry ... 
Harry ... James would never want to let him die ... James would sympathize , Harry ... the picture would pity him ... 
Both Black and Lupine strode forward , grabbed Pettigrew's shoulder , threw him back to the floor . 
He sat there , shrieked in terror , eyed Black and Lupine . 
Black also shakes his body . 
He said : 
- You sold Lily and James to Voldemort . 
Do you deny it ? 
Pettigrew cried . 
The scene looked horrible . 
Pettigrew looked like a bald child who was lying cringing on the floor . 
- Sirius Sirius ... how can you do that ? 
Dark Lord ... I do not know ... he has weapons he can not imagine ... he was threatened by him ... 
Sirius ... I did not have the courage to be like you or Remus or James ... I do not want that to happen ... It is the one that everyone knows someone has raped me .. . 
Black roared : 
- - LIE ! THERE HAS INFORMATION FOR VOLDEMORT HAVE BEEN BEFORE LILY AND JAMES HAVE BEEN KICKED ! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HAPPEN ! 
Pettigrew said , 
- He ... he controlled all places ... 
Refusing him what is not ? 
With a terrible anger on his face , Black said , 
- What is the fight with the evil witch of the world ? the innocent network , Peter à ! 
Pettigrew moaned : 
" You do not understand , Sirius ! 
He will kill me ! 
Black roared again : 
- YOU SHOULD DEATH ! DEFINITELY DEFINITELY FRIENDLY , AS WELL AS READY TO DO THIS ! 
Black and Lupine stood together , shoulder to shoulder , raised wand . 
Lupine quietly said : 
" You should understand that if Voldemort did not kill you , we would have done it . 
Goodbye Peter . 
Hermione raised both her hands to her face and turned to the wall . 
Harry screamed : 
- DO NOT ! 
Harry ran to him , standing alone in front of Pettigrew , facing two wands . 
It says shortness of breath : 
- Do not kill him ! 
Do not kill ! 
Both Black and Lupine almost staggered . 
Black growled : 
- Harry , this scoundrel is the reason for the orphan . 
This despicable dirt just wants to let her die , not a little touched . 
I heard that . 
The itch on his skin is more important than the life of his family . 
Said Harry in a heavy breath : 
- I know . 
We will take him to the castle . 
We will hand him over to the Azkaban dictators ... just please do not kill him ... 
Pettigrew gasped , throwing both arms around his knees . Harry : 
- Harry ! 
I thank you ... it is not worth ... thank you ... 
Harry brushed off Pettigrew's hand in disgust : 
- Out . 
I do this not because of you . 
I do this because I think he will not want his best friends to become murderers ... just for him . 
No one moved or uttered any words except Pettigrew . 
His breath was only raspy as he gripped his chest . 
Black and Lupine looked at each other . 
Then , both of them lowered their wands . 
Black says : 
" You're the only one who has the right to decide , Harry . 
But think ... think of what he did ... 
Harry repeated : 
- He could be imprisoned in Azkaban . 
If anyone deserves that place then that person is him ... 
Pettigrew was still whining behind Harry . 
Lupine said : 
- Well , stand aside , Harry . 
Harry hesitated . 
Lupine said : 
- You will bind him . 
I swear it's just that . 
Harry stepped out . 
This time , the ropes sputtered from Lupine's wand , blinking Pettigrew , who was bound to his limbs and mouth , writhing on the floor . 
Black's wand still pointed at Pettigrew . 
Black growled : 
- But if you make a transformation , Peter , we ' ll kill you . 
Do you agree , Harry ? 
Harry looked down at the poor figure on the floor and nodded , allowing Pettigrew to see . 
Lupine said , voice suddenly became reality : 
- - OK . 
Ron , you can not tie broken bones to a good baby like Pomfrey , so you think it's best to splice your legs until we can get your baby back to the ventricular . 
He hurried to Ron's side , bent down , tossed his wand on his leg and whispered : 
- Ferula ! 
Ron's legs appear to be wrapped around his ribs . 
Lupine stood up . 
Ron put all the weight of his body with one leg still healthy , his face no longer grimace . 
It says : 
- Thank you , I feel better . 
Hermione looked at Snape's snowy body on the floor , asking , 
- What about Snape ? 
Lupine bent down to inspect Snape's throat and said , 
- There is nothing serious about him . 
You're not overdone a little bit of enthusiasm . 
Still a bit cold . 
Well ... perhaps we should bail out before returning to the safe castle . 
We carry him in the same condition ... 
Master muttered : 
- Mobilicorpus ! 
As if there was an invisible rope on the neck , wrists and knees of Mr. Snape , standing up , his head still bent uneasily , like a ridiculous figurehead . 
He was standing a few feet above the ground , his legs dangling . 
Lupine picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it securely into his pocket . 
Black pointed to the Pettigrew said : 
- And two of us should be tied with this name , to be sure . 
Lupine said : 
- I do . 
- You too . 
Ron hopped , speaking in anger . 
Black magically took out the eight handcuffs in the air . 
Soon Pettigrew stood up , his left hand locked in Lupine's hand , and his right hand locked with Ron's left hand . 
Ron's face is very criminal . 
It seems to regard Scrabbers ' fraudulent identity as a personal insult . 
Crookshanks lightly leapt out of the bed and smoothly diverted the way out of the room , his ruffled tail ruffled like a chewing bottle . 
Chapter 20 
MARRIAGE OF THE DRAFT 
Harry has never been to a strange group of people . 
Crookshanks led the way down the stairs , Lupine , Pettigrew and Ron followed , looking like athletes competing in a six - legged race . 
Next , Professor Snape , drifting in the horror of his hair , his toe touches the stairs as the crowd descends . 
He gets his own wand , now in the hands of Black , lifting . 
Harry and Hermione went last . 
Getting back to the tunnel was a bit hard , Lupine , Pettinggrew and Ron had to swing past . 
Lupine still controls Pettigrew with his wand . 
Harry could see them squatting vigorously along the tunnel in a row . 
Crookshanks is still leading the way , Harry steps behind Sirius Black , he still controls Snape's body drifting in the air , the head bent on the continuous low ceiling . 
Harry had the impression that Sirius was not trying to do anything to save Snape from collision . 
As they began to move slowly along the tunnel , Sirius suddenly said to Harry , 
- Do you know what Pettinggrew means ? 
Harry replied , 
- meaning freedom . 
- Right ... 
But you are also ... I do not know if anyone has ever told you ... my godfather . 
Harry said : 
- Yes , I know that . 
Sirius said hardly : 
- Ờ ... my father's three children entrust him to be his guardian , if something happens to them ... 
Harry waited . 
Did Sirius intend to say what he thought he was saying ? 
Sirius said : 
- Of course you will understand if you want to stay with your aunt . 
But ... er ... think , once your honor is restored ... if you want .... 
want to have another family ... 
A kind of explosion just happened deep inside Harry . 
He exclaimed : 
- What ... live with me ? 
Out of the Dursleys ? 
At first he accidentally dropped a rock on a rock that swept over the ceiling of the tunnel . 
Sirius said , 
- Of course , I do not think you want to . 
Please understand , I think you are ... 
- You do not go crazy ... ? 
Harry's voice resembles that of Sirius : 
" Of course you want to get out of the Dursleys . 
Do you have a house ? 
As long as I'm home to you 
Sirius immediately turned to face Harry's eyes . Snape's head snapped at the ceiling , but Sirius did not seem to bother about it . 
He said : 
- You want to ? 
You really want to ? 
Harry said : 
- I want to lose ! 
Sirius ' haggard face blossomed with a genuine smile that Harry saw for the first time . 
That smile made Sirius ' face completely different and the difference was amazing , as if a young man of ten was smiling brightly under a starving mask . 
At that moment , Harry realized he was the right man to smile at his parents ' wedding . 
They did not say anything until they reached the end of the tunnel . 
Crookshanks jumped out of the tunnel mouth first ; It must have pressed the knob on Léo Roi's trunk , because Lupine , Pettigrew and Ron climbed up to the ground without hearing the brunt of the branches . 
Sirius took Snape through the mouth of the cave , then stood aside to let Harry and Hermione go ahead . 
Eventually everyone was out of the tunnel . 
The school grounds were very dark , the only light was the light from the windows of the castle . 
People walk without saying a word . 
Pettinggrew was still wheezing and whimpering . Harry's mind is ong . 
He was about to leave the Dursleys ... 
It will be about living with Sirius Black , his best friend ... 
It feels ecstatic ... 
Well , what happens when it tells the Dursleys it will come to live with the fugitives they saw on television . 
In the front , Lupine is warning Pettigrew : 
- Just a jarring move , Peter ! 
His wand was still horizontal , pointing directly at Pettigrew's chest . 
They quietly 
Leaning through the courtyard , the light from the castle gradually became brighter , louder . 
Snape's teacher was still bizarrely trotting in front of Sirius , his chin now hanging on his chest . 
But suddenly ... 
A cloud of flew away , the dim shadow of people suddenly appeared on the ground . 
Group of people bathing in the moonlight ... 
Mr. Snape bumped into Lupine , Pettigrew and Ron . 
Ron stopped abruptly , Sirius stood dead . 
He raised his arm to stop Harry and Hermione . 
Harry could see Lupine's silhouette . 
He was stiff . 
Then shaking hands and feet trembling . 
Shouted Hermione loudly : 
- Oh my parents ... you have not taken medicine yet ! 
He is dangerous ! 
Sirius whispered : 
- Run ! Run fast ! 
Run now ! 
But Harry could not run . 
Ron was chained to Pettinggrew and Lupine . 
It jumped forward , but Sirius shot at his chest and threw it back . 
- Leave it to you . RUN ! 
A scary growl growls . Lupine's head is long . 
His body is the same . 
His shoulders curled round . 
The growth of the hair grows over the face of the limbs , and the toes of the fingers curl into sharp , sharp claws . 
Crookshanks hair stood up , and it stepped back . 
As the werewolf turned his head , his jaw dropped , Sirius was standing beside Harry . 
He has transformed into a giant dog of the size of the bear to jump forward . 
When the werewolf tugged at his feet to get out of the cuffs , the dog clutched his neck and dragged him away , away from Ron and Pettigrew . 
Both animals clenched together , jaw lock function , claw claw claw ... 
Harry stood dead staring at the strange scene , too attentive watching the match between the dog and the werewolf so much that he ignored anything else . 
Hermione's scream alerted Harry ... 
Pettigrew came forward , grabbed Lupine's wand and dropped it . 
Ron fell to the ground for a moment with his bandaged leg . 
There was a flash of lightning , a flash of lightning ... and Ron lay motionless on the ground . 
Another blast ... this time the Crookshanks flew into the air and dropped the bag down , lying in a pile of ... 
Harry pointed his wand at Pettigrew , screaming : 
- Expelliarmus ! 
Lupine's wand flew up to the sky , drawing his eyes . 
Harry ran to shout : 
- stand still ! 
But it was too late , Pettigrew had transformed , Harry could barely see the rat's tail running past the cuffs on Ron's arm spreading out the mango waves , and Harry heard the rats scurry in the grass . 
A howling and a grumbling noise . 
Harry turned to see the werewolf had escaped the dog , began to run quickly into the forest Forbidden . 
Harry screamed : 
- Sirius , he's hiding , Pettigrew has been hiding ! 
Sirius was bleeding , his long wounds scraping across his muzzle and back , but Harry's screams , he crawled up , and immediately , his footsteps rushed past the schoolyard and sank into silence . . 
Harry and Hermione went to Ron , Hermione whispered : 
- What did Ron do ? 
Ron's eyes were closed , his mouth open . 
Everyone heard Ron's breathing so he was sure it was alive , but it did not seem to recognize the two of them . 
Harry desperately looked around : 
- I do not know , either ! 
Both Sirius and Lupine were gone ... They had no one except Snape , still unconscious and floating in the sky . 
Harry threw his hair out of his forehead , trying to think straight into the matter . 
- We should take them to the castle and report this to someone else . go ... 
But at that moment , they heard a yelp , a painful moan from a dog , back in the night . 
Harry glared at the darkness , murmuring : 
- Sirius ... 
She hesitated for a moment . 
At this point it can not do anything for Ron , while Sirius is in trouble ... 
Harry started running , and Hermione ran behind him . 
The echo seems to come from the lake side . 
The two legs on the neck that run in that direction . 
And Harry , at the beginning of his run , felt cold , not realizing what that price meant . 
The creaking sound suddenly stopped . 
As they ran to the shores , they understood why Sirius had turned into a human . 
He was curled up to avoid the blow , his arms raised over his head . 
Moaning 
- Do you want to ... ? 
And then , Harry saw them . 
The Azkaban dreadlocks , at least as many as hundreds , gathered in a black cloud at the lake and were running toward them . 
Harry twirled , a frosty cold glimpse into his internal organs , the mist beginning to blur its vision . 
As more and more Azkhaban dementors emerged from the darkness on both sides , they were squeezing the siege . 
Harry raised his wand , shouting : 
- Hermione , think of something fun ! 
He blinked continuously , trying to look more clearly . 
He shook his head to shake off the weak cry that was beginning to rumble in his head . 
- I'm going to live with my godfather ... 
I'm going out of the Dursleys ... 
Harry forced himself to think of Sirius , and thought only of Sirius , and began to cry : 
- Expecto patronum ! 
Expecto patronum ! 
Sirius shivered , rolling back and lying motionless on the ground , pale as dead . 
- he's okay 
I will live with him . 
Expecto patronum ! 
Hermione , help me ! 
Expecto patronum ! 
Hermione whispered : 
- Expecto ... 
Expecto ... 
Expecto ... 
But she can not do the exorcism . 
The Azkaban dementors are approaching , only about three meters away from them . 
They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione , one at a time . 
Harry screamed , trying to croak in his ear : 
- EXPECTO PATRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM ! 
A thin , silver - colored smoke came out of Harry's wand and hovered like a fog in front of him . 
At the same time , Harry felt Hermione come down beside him . 
Now it is alone ... completely alone ... 
- Expecto ... 
Expecto patronum ! 
Harry felt his knees come down to touch the cold grass . 
Fog as cloud cover obscured his eyes . 
With a huge effort , Harry struggled to remember that Sirius was innocent ... innocent ... " My nephew will be fine ... I will be with you ... " 
Harry groaned loudly : 
- Expecto patronum ! 
With the dim light of the guardian deity , Harry saw an Azkaban dictator step aside , stopping right next to him . 
That daredevil can not walk through the layer of silver that surrounds Harry that he just created . 
A mournful hand stuck out from beneath the coat . 
That hand made a move as the guardian deception aside . 
Harry whispered : 
- do not ! 
do not ... he is innocent ... 
Expecto ... 
Expecto patronum ! 
He could see the Azkhaban dementors glare at him , hearing the sighs as the east wind blew around . 
The darling closest to Harry seemed to be evaluating Harry . 
Then he held both rotten hands , pulling his hooded head down ... 
Where it was supposed to be , there were only thin , scarred gray skin that sealed the two empty follicles empty . 
But on that face there was a mouth ... a gaping hole in the air that caused the sound to sound like a squeak of the dying man . 
There was a terrifying panic that invaded Harry's entire body so much that he could not speak or move . 
The god of the fate of it shimmering and dead ... 
The white mist made Harry blind to see nothing . 
It must fight ... 
Expecto patronum ! ... 
He did not see anything ... and he heard the familiar screams from far away ... 
Expecto patronum ! ... 
He fumbled for Sirius in the fog , then found his arm ... they did not seem to catch him ... 
But a stiff sticky hand tightened around Harry's neck , forcing him to raise his head . 
He can feel the breath of the dementor . 
He is going to pay Harry first ... 
Harry smelled his rotten breath ... 
Harry's cry echoing in his head ... 
His cry would be the last thing Harry could hear ... 
And then , through the mist that was engulfing it , Harry felt like a silver ray , brighter and brighter . 
He felt it fall down on the grass ... 
Face down , face down , Harry is so weak that he can not budge , nausea and trembling , but he tries to open his eyes . 
The dazzling light is fading over the grass around it ... 
The cry of his cheeks stopped . 
The cold bones are gone ... 
Something had chased away the Azkaban dementors ... that was still circling around , Hermione and Sirius ... 
The Azkaban dementors are swaying in the air and the beeping of the blasphemers is blurry . 
They are leaving ... the air is warming up ... 
With all the rest left in his body , Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal in the middle of the glowing light as it flew over the lake . 
Eyes blurred with perspiration , Harry tried to look at what it was ... 
The animal is radiant like a bird . 
Try to keep yourself from fainting , Harry watched the unripe animal and stopped the hook when it reached the other side of the lake . 
For a moment , Harry saw , in the beaming light of the animal , that a man was picking the animal back ... the man raised his hand and patted the animal ... that person looked strangely familiar . But that person can not be ... 
Harry does not understand anymore . 
It also can not think of anything else . 
He felt the last of his strength leaving her , and his head struck the ground , unconscious . 
Chapter 21 
HERMIONE SECRETS 
- The horror ... the horror ... the mystery is that no one died ... never heard of such a thing ... may at that time there he was , Mr. Snape .... 
- Thank you Minister . 
- I dare say he will be Merlin , second degree . 
If I manage it , then 
First off , but play ! . 
- Minister , I really thank you very much . 
- The wounds he was suffering ... probably caused by Black ? . 
- To be honest , it was the work of Potter , Weasley and Granger , Minister .... 
- Maybe not yet ! . 
- Black has fallen for them , I see it immediately . 
Just judging by the attitude of the kids I know right there is a Shuffle . 
The kids seemed to believe he was innocent . This is not their fault . 
But on the other hand , their interference could , almost all the time , make Black escape . 
They obviously think they can catch Black alone . 
In the past they have been out of many cases . 
I'm afraid they are so high ... and of course Potter is always allowed by the President .... 
- Ah , this , Mr. Snape ... 
Harry Potter , you know ... we're all a little more biased when it comes to him . 
- But , how much special treatment do you have for it ? 
Personally , I try to treat it with everyone else . 
And any student must be expelled ... minimum punishment ... if he leads his friends into such danger . 
The Minister , please consider : against all school rules - after all the precautions posed for its safety - breaking the limits , at night , the hut with a werewolf and a murderer ... 
And I have reason to believe that it also visited the village of Hogsmeade illegally . 
- Uh ... to see , Master Snape , to see ... 
Children are definitely stupid .... 
Harry lay quietly listening with his eyes closed . 
He felt very shocked . 
The words it was listening seemed to float very slowly through his ears to his brain , so it was difficult to understand . 
Its legs feel heavy as lead . 
His eyes are too heavy , not open up ... 
It just wants to be here , on this smooth bed , forever ... 
- But what amazed me was the action of the Azkaban dictators ... 
Did not you know what made them retreat , Master Snape ? . 
- No , Minister . 
By the time I arrived , they were taking their place at the entrances . 
- Extremely weird ! 
But Black , Harry and that girl .... 
- They were all unconscious when I arrived . 
Of course , I tied my hands and feet and locked Black's mouth , allowing a stretcher , and bringing them back to the castle . . 
A quiet space . Harry's mind seemed to react a little faster , and when it came out a little bit of a burning sensation in his stomach ... 
Harry opened his eyes . 
Things are still a bit fuzzy . 
Someone has removed his glasses . 
It is in the dark room . At the end of the room , Harry could see Mrs. Pomfrey standing with her back to him , crouching down on a bed . 
Harry tried to look at him . 
Under Mrs. Pomfrey's protective arm revealed redhead Ron's hair . 
Harry was on the pillow . 
On the bed on the right it was Hermione lying down . 
The moon was shining on her bed . Hermione's eyes widened . 
She looked petrified . 
And when he realized that Harry had woken up , Hermione put a finger to her lips and pointed toward the sickness door . 
The door opened , and through that loophole , the voice of Mr. Fudge and Mr. Snape from the hallway came in . 
Mrs. Pomfrey was now hurrying across the ward in the dark , to Harry's bed . 
She turned her head . 
Her hand holds an extremely large chocolatier , the largest chocolatier Harry has ever seen in her life . 
It looks like a small rock . 
Mrs. Pomfrey said quickly : 
- Well , you're awake ! . 
She placed the chocolate on the bedside table of Harry and started to pound it out with a small hammer . 
Harry and Hermione asked , 
- How are you , Ron ? . 
Mrs Pomfrey asserted explicitly : 
- It will live . 
For two games ... two games must stay here until I am satisfied that the game ... 
Potter , what are you doing ? . 
Harry was sitting up , wearing his glasses and taking his wand . 
It says : 
- I need to see the Principal . 
Mrs. Pomfrey said softly , 
- Potter , where are you ? 
Black was captured . 
He was locked upstairs . 
The Azkaban dictators are about to punish him for a second .... 
- WHAT ? . 
Harry leapt out of bed , and Hermione did the same . 
But the screams made the people in the hallway hear . 
A second later , Mr. Fudge and Snape entered the room . 
Mr. Fudge looked puzzled . 
- Harry , what's wrong ? You should lie down on the bed .... 
He turned to Mrs. Pomfrey , anxiously asking : 
- Did he eat some chocolate ? . 
- said Harry : 
- Sir , please listen to me , Sirius is innocent ! 
Pettigrew faked his own death ! 
We see him in the dark ! 
You can not let the Azkhaban dictator do it with Sirius ! 
He is .... 
But Mr. Fudge shook his head with a small smile on his lips : 
- Harry , Harry , I was confused , I just had a scary experience , now I'm lying down , we have control over everything .... 
Harry screamed : 
- WHAT NOT CONTROL ? HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEOPLE ! . 
Hermione said : 
- Minister , please listen to us . 
She ran up to Harry and gazed at Fudge's face , pleading : 
- I also see Pettigrew . 
He was Ron's mouse . 
He is a pet appetizer . 
I mean Pettinggrew , and .... 
Snape said , 
- Minister , do you see ? 
Both of them are charms ... 
Black was so high that it was useless . 
Harry screamed : 
- DO NOT SLEEP ! . 
Mrs. Pomfrey angrily said : 
- Mr. Minister ! 
Professor ! 
I ask the two of you come out for ! 
Potter is my patient , and must not make it sad ! . 
Harry said angrily , 
- I'm not sad ! 
I'm trying to explain to them what happened . 
If everyone listened to me .... 
But Mrs. Pomfrey suddenly put a chocolate chip into Harry's mouth . 
He choked , and Mrs. Pomfrey passed the opportunity to tie it down on the bed . 
Finished , she turned to two men : 
- Now , Minister please , these children need to be healed . 
Please go out for .... 
The door opened again . 
It's Dumbledore . 
Harry struggles to whack the chocolate out of his mouth , and then gets up again : 
- Professor Dumbledore , Sirius Black .... 
Mrs. Pomfrey was mad : 
- Oh my God ! Is this a vagal disease ? Mr. President , I definitely have to .... 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- I'm sorry , Mrs. Poppy . 
But I need to say a few words to Potter and Miss Granger . 
I just finished talking with Sirius Black .... 
Mr. Snape interjected : 
- I suppose he told you the myth that he had pumped into the minds of the kids ? 
The story of the rat and Pettigrew alive . 
Dumbledore carefully examined Snape's master through his half - moon glasses and said , 
- Indeed , Black has told that story . 
Snape snarled . 
- So my evidence is not worth counting ? 
Pettigrew was not present in the Shack , but I did not see any traces of him in the school grounds . 
Hermione said earnestly : 
- Teacher , it is because he fainted . 
You did not arrive at the right time to hear .... 
- Miss Granger , MUSCLES ! . 
Mr. Fudge said , 
" Look , Snape , this girl is confused , we have to let her ... " 
Dumbledore said briefly : 
- I want to talk privately to Harry and Hermione . 
Mr. Fudge , Mr. Snape , and Mrs. Pomfrey ... please let us stay alone .... 
Mrs. Pomfrey stammered : 
- Headmaster ! 
Children need to be treated . 
They need a break . . 
Dumbledore said : 
- This can not wait , I have to repeat that . 
Pomfrey stuck his tongue out and strode toward her office behind the sick room , slamming the door behind her . 
Mr. Fudge looked at the big gold watch hanging dangling from his waistcoat and said , 
- This time the Azkhaban dementors should have come . 
I will go out to meet them . 
Dumbledore . See you on the floor . 
He walked through the door and held the door open for Snape to come along . 
But Snape did not want to budge . 
His eyes stared at Dumbledore's face , whispering to him : 
- You certainly can not believe a word in Black's story ? . 
Dumbledore repeated : 
- I want to talk to Harry and Hermione only ! . 
Snape took a step forward in front of Dumbledore . 
He said urgently : 
- Sirius Black revealed the ability to kill humanity when he was sixteen . 
Principal , would not you have forgotten that ? 
Did you forget that he once tried to kill me ? . 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- My memory is still as lucid , Severus brother ! . 
Mr. Snape turned and went straight to the door that Mr. Fudge still kept open . 
When the door closed behind them , Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione . 
They both spoke out at the same time : 
" Professor , Uncle Black said that ... 
We have seen Pettigrew .... 
- ... he ran away when Professor Lupine turned into a werewolf .... 
- ... he was a mouse .... 
" ... Pettinggrew's frontal claws , I mean , fingers , were cut off .... 
- ... 
Pettinggrew attacked Ron , not Sirius . 
But Dumbledore raised his hand to stop the flood . 
He said softly : 
- Now it's your turn to listen , and I ask you not to interrupt me , because 
Not much time left . 
There is no evidence to confirm Black's story except that of the children ... and the words of the thirteen - year - olds will not convince anyone . 
A road full of witnesses swears they see Sirius assassinate Pettigrew . 
He also testified before the Ministry of Magic that Sirius had been the secretary of the Potter family . 
Harry can not help himself : 
- Professor Lupine can tell you .... 
- Professor Lupine is now in the deep forest , can not tell anyone anything . By the time Professor Lupine was back in person , it was too late , Sirius would be miserable , rather than die . 
Perhaps you should add that most of us do not trust the werewolf , Lupine's testimony will be insignificant ... the details of Lupine and Sirius are old friends . . 
- But .... 
- Listen to your teacher , Harry ! 
It's too late , do you understand me ? 
You must see Snape's report more convincing than your story . 
Cried Hermione desperately : 
- Snape hates Sirius ! 
Just because foolish jokes that Sirius played the little boy .... 
- Sirius did not act as a bright light as an innocent person . 
With the attack of Mrs. Beo to bring the knife into the Gryffindor Tower , without Pettinggrew , no matter how alive or dead , we can not really change Sirius Black's judgment . 
- But you believe us ! . 
- Yes , I believe . 
But he did not have the right to force others to see the truth , or to overwhelm the Minister of Magic . . 
Harry looked up at Dumbledore's grave face and saw the ground shattering at his feet . 
He was used to thinking that Dumbledore could solve all the problems . 
He was expecting Dumbledore's empty hands to shine , having some unexpected solution . 
But no ... the last hope of the children has dissipated . 
Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked at Harry and Hermione . 
He slowly said : 
- What we need is more time . 
- But .... 
Hermione opened her mouth and her eyes widened . 
- A ! . 
Dumbledore said very slowly and very clearly : 
- Now , pay attention . 
Sirius was locked up in the office of Professor Flitwick on the seventh floor . 
Thirteenth window from the west tower right . 
If all goes well , tonight you can save not just one innocent life . 
But both of you must remember this : You must not be seen ! 
Granger , you know the law ... you know what could be wrong ... 
The - child - right - not - be - see - see ! . 
Harry had no idea what was going on . 
Dumbledore turned his heels and looked back at the door . 
- You are about to lock the children again . 
Now ... . 
Dumbledore watched the clock . 
- Five minutes and half to midnight . 
Granger , in just three turns . 
Wish you good luck . 
When the door closed behind Dumbledore , Harry repeated : 
- Lucky ? 
Three rounds ? 
What are you talking about ? What do we do ? . 
But Hermione was clutching at her lover's collar , trying to pull out a long , beautiful , long golden necklace from within . 
She urgently said : 
- Harry , come here , hurry up ! . 
Harry walked towards her , completely ignorant . 
Hermione turns the gold wire . 
Harry saw the necklace wearing a mysterious hourglass . 
- here ... . 
Hermione whipped around the necklace of gold around Harry's neck . 
She almost breathless : 
- Ready ? . 
I do not understand anything at all : 
- What are we doing ? . 
Hermione rotated the clock of the sand in exactly three turns . 
The hospital room suddenly disappeared . 
Harry felt it was flying backwards , very fast . 
A tangle of colors and shapes intertwined and slipped through his eyes ; its a buzzing sound 
He tried to scream but could not hear his voice . 
And then Harry felt his feet touching the hard ground , everything was clear . 
It was standing next to Hermione in the empty lobby . 
A golden stream of golden sunlight was streaming through the paved stone floor leading to the open door . 
The necklace dangles at Harry's neck , and he looks around him and asks : 
- Hermione , what ... ? . 
Hermione pulled it across the lobby , to the door of a bedroom to the broom . 
She opened the door , thrusting Harry inside , between buckets of pots and wipes , and then followed , then closed the door . 
- Hermione , what ... what ... what is this ... ? . 
Hermione lifted the gold chain from Harry's neck , whispering it in the dark : 
- We went back in time , back three hours .... 
Harry poked his leg , pinching a strong . Too bad , so it's impossible to dream of a bizarre dream . 
- But ... . 
- Suit ! 
Listen ! 
Someone is coming ! 
I think ... I think we are . 
Hermione pressed her ear against the door of the room . 
The sound of footsteps crossing the lobby ... right , I think we're headed down to Hagrid's house . 
Harry whispered : 
- Did you tell us that we were in this room , out there ? . 
Hermione pressed her ear against the door of the room . 
- Yeah , I'm sure we were ... it sounded like the footsteps of three people ... and we were walking slowly because we were invisible cloak .... 
She stopped talking suddenly , listening intently . 
- We just step down the steps .... 
Hermione sat down with a floppy , desperate anxiety , and Harry just wanted to answer some questions : 
- Where did the sword come from , the hourglass ? . 
Cried Hermione : 
- That's what I call the Turn of Time , by Professor Mc Gonagall gave me on the first day that we back in school . 
I have been using it for a whole year to attend all classes . 
Professor McGregag made a vow not to tell anyone . 
She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so they could accept her to keep the Time . 
She had to tell them that she was an exemplary student , and I never used it for anything other than studying . 
I turned back in time to be able to go back to the past for a few hours , that's how I learned the lessons at the same time , you know ? 
But ... Harry , I do not understand what Dumbledore wants us to do . 
Why do you tell us to come back for three hours ? How can this help Sirius ? . 
Harry stared at Hermione's dark face . 
It says leisurely : 
- Yeah , something happened around this time that you wanted us to change . 
What happened ? 
Three hours ago , we went down to Hagrid's house . 
Hermione said : 
- Now , three hours ago , we were going down to Hagrid's house . 
We just heard our feet out the door .... 
Harry frowned , it felt like he was twisting his mind to concentrate . 
- Dumbledore said ... just say that we can save not just one innocent life .... 
Harry came out : 
- Hermione , we will save Buckbeak ! . 
" But how could he save Sirius ? " . 
" Master Dumbledore said ... you just told us where the window was ... the window of Flitwick's office ! " That's where they locked Sirius ! 
We had to ride the Bang - Code flying on that window to save Sirius . 
Then Sirius could run away with Buckbeak ... both of them would run away together ! . 
Based on what Harry saw on Hermione's face , she was scared of death : 
- If we try to do that without being seen , then it is a miracle ! . 
- Oh , we have to find a way to do it ! . 
Harry finished speaking , stood up , pressed his ear to the door . 
- We did not hear anybody out there ... let's go .... 
Harry pushed open the door of the room . 
Lobby is empty . 
Extremely quiet and very fast , the two children rushed out of the room and slipped down the stone steps . 
In the afternoon , the trees in the Forbidden Forest once again flashed yellow . 
Hermione looked back at the castle , shouting : 
- If anyone saw through the window .... 
Said Harry firmly : 
- We ran . 
Go straight to the Forbidden Forest , okay ? 
We ' ll hide behind a tree or something and watch out .... 
Said Hermione weakly : 
- but we have to go around the glass enclosure ! 
We need to keep careful , avoid going through the front door of Hagrid's house , otherwise they will see us . 
We should now go to Hagrid's house . 
At the thought of what Hermione had said , Harry had started a sprint , and Hermione ran behind him . 
They crossed the vegetable garden to the glass enclosure , stopped a little behind the building and then continued to run as fast as possible , passing the Willow Roi , toward the forest to find shelter . 
When she was safe in the shade of trees , Harry looked back ; Just a few seconds later Hermione caught up with her , gasping for breath . 
She said no : 
- Alright . 
We need to go up to Uncle Hagrid . 
Please do not let Harry be seen .... 
Two children quietly walked through the woods , always pairing the forest . 
Then , as soon as he saw the front door of Hagrid's house , they heard a knock at the door . 
They ran behind the trunk of a huge oak , hid there and each of them poked his head out to one side of the tree and peered . 
Hagrid appeared at the door of the house , trembling and white , looking around to see who knocked on the door . 
And Harry heard his own voice : 
- We're here . 
We are wearing invisibility cloak . 
Uncle us in the house to take his jacket off . 
Hagrid grunted : 
- You should not have come here ! 
He stood back and closed the door quickly . 
Harry fervently said : 
- this is the most weird thing we ever did . 
Hermione whispered : 
- Let's go a little further . 
We need to get close to Buckbeak . 
They crept through the woods until they saw the restless parasol being tied up in the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin garden . 
Harry whispered : 
- Do it now ? 
Hermione said : 
- Can not ! 
If we were to steal Buckbeak now , some of the Commissioners would think Hagrid would drop it ! 
We had to wait until they saw clearly it was tied out ... 
Harry said : 
- So we only have about sixty seconds to act . 
This starts to seem impossible . 
At that moment , there was a porcelain inside of Hagrid's hut , Hermione whispered : 
- that's Hagrid's uncle to break the milk bottle . 
A little more to find out Scabbers ... 
Just like Hermione , just a few minutes later , they heard her surprise , the inside of the house . 
Harry suddenly said : 
- Hermione , if we ... we run into it and grab Pettinggrew ... then you see ? 
- Where is ! 
Cried Hermione in a panicky voice : 
- Do not you understand ? 
We are breaking one of the most serious witch laws ! 
No one is allowed to change the time , no one else ! 
You heard Dumbledore say that ... if we were seen ... 
- We were only Hagrid and we see ! 
Hermione said : 
- Harry , do you think if you see yourself now at Hagrid's house then what would you think ? 
Harry stammered : 
- I think ... 
Oh ... I think I'm crazy ... or I think there's a dark magic going on ... 
- Exactly ! 
You do not know , you can attack yourself ! 
Do you understand ? 
Professor Mc Gonagall told me what terrible things would happen when wizards were ambiguous about time ... 
The pile of people who have come to kill their past and future just by mistake . 
Harry said : 
- Okay ! That's just an opinion so , I just think so ... 
But Hermione shook her elbow , pointing at the castle . 
Harry moved his head a few inches to see the scene far from the main door of the castle . 
Dumbledore , Mr. Fudge , the old board member , the same captain Macnair was walking down the steps . 
Hermione said breathlessly : 
- We're going to have to go out ! 
And so , a little behind , the door behind Hagrid's house opened , and Harry saw it , Ron and Hermione went out with Hagrid . 
Surely this is the strangest feeling in Harry's life : standing behind a tree and observing itself in a pumpkin garden ! 
- It's okay , Beaky . 
It's okay ... 
Hagrid turned to Harry , Ron and Hermione said : 
- go away , go away . 
But the three of them did not budge . 
- Uncle Hagrid , we can not ... 
- We ' ll tell them what really happened ... 
- They can not kill it ... 
- go ! 
Without them and the trouble , the situation is bad enough ! 
Harry saw Hermione in the pumpkin garden , shedding his invisible cloak over him and Ron . 
- go away , do not have to listen to it ... 
There was a knock on the front door of Hagrid's house . 
Group behavior has come . 
Hagrid turned and went back to his hut , leaving the back door open . 
Harry looked down at the grass around Hagrid's house , and heard three feet back . 
Ron , Hermione and Hermione were gone ... but Harry and Hermione hid behind the trees now and could hear the story going on inside the hut just across the gap . 
Macnair's cold voice resounded : 
- Where is the beast ? 
Hagrid's voice hoarse : 
- In the garden . 
Harry rested his head behind the tree as Macnair's face appeared in Hagrid's window , glaring at Buckbeak . 
Then they heard Mr. Fudge : 
- We ... 
Ah ... you should read to him the official execution notice , Mr. Hagrid . 
I will read soon . 
And then both he and Macnair need to sign . 
Brother Macnair , you must also listen , that is the procedure ... 
Macnair's face disappeared from the window . 
At this moment is the time to act , or will miss the opportunity . 
Harry whispered to Hermione : 
- Wait here hear ! 
I will go to work it ! 
As Fudge's voice echoed , Harry jumped out of the tree , jumped over Hagrid's pumpkins and approached Buckbeak . 
The Committee for the Elimination of Dangerous Animals decides that the Buckbeak Code , hereinafter referred to as the convicted person , will be executed on June 6 at dusk . 
Trying not to blink , Harry turned again and gazed at Buckbeak's ferocious orange eyes , and bowed . 
Buckbeak slid his knees down and then straightened up . 
Harry begins to unbuckle Buckbeak's rope with the fence . 
... beheaded , assigned to the employee , the sentence appointed by the Commission is Walden Macnair ... 
Harry whispered : 
- Let's go , Buckbeak . Hurry up , we ' ll help you . Go smoothly ... smoothly ... 
... 
in the witness of the undersigned . 
Mr. Hagrid , you sign here ... 
Harry pulls out his rope as hard as he can , but Buckbeak also slams his front legs deep into the ground . 
The voice of the old member of the commission came from Hagrid's hut : 
- Well , let's get this down . 
Mr. Hagrid , maybe he stayed in the house better ? 
- Are not ! 
I ... I want to be by my side ... I do not want to leave it alone ... 
Footsteps echoed from the hut , Harry hissed . 
- Buckbeak , leave ! 
Harry yanked the rope around Buckbeak's neck . 
The Maze began to walk , clapping his wings in disgust . 
Both Harry and the Seahawks were about three meters from the Forbidden Forest , in the clear view of Hagrid's back door . 
Dumbledore's voice snapped : 
" Take a moment , Mr. Macnair . 
You need to sign it too ! 
Footsteps stopped . 
Harry struggled to pull the rope , Buckbeak snapped his beak and stepped a little faster . 
Hermione's white face stuck out behind a tree . 
She cried : 
- Hurry up , Harry ! 
Harry still hear Dumbledore talking inside the hut . 
She tugged at the rope again , and Buckbeak suddenly ran . 
Both humans and animals finally reach the forest . 
Hermione leaped out of the hiding place behind the tree trunk , crying : 
- Hurry up ! 
Hurry up ! 
She also took the rope , adding to her weight to make Buckbeak go faster . 
Harry looked over his shoulder . 
Now they are out of sight , no longer see Hagrid's garden . 
Harry whispered to Hermione : 
- Stop ! 
Beware they hear our footsteps ... 
The door behind Hagrid's house opened with a jam . 
Harry , Hermione and Buckbeak both stood quietly , even as the Seahawks seemed to be listening attentively . 
All quietly ... 
Then the old man's voice said : 
- Where is it ? 
Where is that beast ? 
The name of the executioner is very angry : 
- It's tied up here ! 
I just saw it ! 
New here ! 
Dumbledore's voice sounds happy : 
- Strange is strange ! 
Hagrid cried out : 
- Beaky ! 
There was something soaring in the air , and the sound of the tongue slammed down . 
The name of the captain seemed to be mad , throwing the hammer into the fence . 
Then a long howl , and this time they could hear the voice of old Hagrid and sobbing : 
- Gone ! Gone ! 
Pray for its small beak ! 
It's gone ! 
Make sure you pull out your rope for freedom ! 
Oh , Beaky , you're smart ! 
Buckbeak began to strain the rope , seeking to return to Hagrid . 
Harry and Hermione hugged the rope and clicked on the ground to hold it . 
The name of the grumble : 
- Someone unplugged it ! 
We must hunt down in the school yard , in the forest ... 
Dumbledore said , his voice sounding nice : 
" Macnair , if the Bang Bang was stolen , would you think the thief would take it on foot ? 
You should search the sky , if you can do it ... 
Hagrid , I'm craving a cup of tea , or a glass of wine as possible . 
Hagrid's voice was weak but full of happiness : 
- D ... of course , Professor ! 
Please invite the house , invite ... 
Harry and Hermione listen very carefully . 
They heard the footsteps , the croaking curses of the executioner , the creaking doors and all the silence . 
Harry looked around , whispering : 
- Now what ? 
Hermione looked shaky : 
- We will have to hide here . 
We have to wait until they reach the castle . 
Then we had to wait until we could safely ride the Buckbeak to the window of Sirius ' locker room . 
Two more hours he is not there anymore ... 
Oh , this is going to be hard for me ... 
She looked anxiously over her shoulder , looking deep into the forest . 
At this time the sun is setting . 
Harry pondered : 
- We're going to have to go . 
Remember not to take your eyes off the Willow Roi , otherwise we will not know how things have gone . 
Hermione tightened the rope tied to Buckbeak's neck : 
- It is OK . 
But , Harry , remember , we can not let anyone see us ... 
They walked around the edge of the forest , in the darkness that was covering them all , until they found a grove from which they could both hug and see Willow Roi . 
Harry suddenly shouted : 
" Behold , Ron ! 
A fuzzy shadow was running like mad across the grass and the scream of that shadow echoed in the stillness : 
- stay away from it ... go elsewhere ... 
Scabbers , come back here ... 
And then they saw two more shades suddenly appear . 
Harry sees himself and Hermione is chasing Ron . 
Ron then dashed to the ground : 
- You got it ! 
Get out , the cat outbreak ... 
Harry exclaimed : 
- Sirius . 
From the roots of the Willow Roi spawn a litter figure of a giant dog . 
They saw the dog hit Harry and Ron ... 
Harry watched the dog with Ron chut up the tree roots : 
- Looks from here is even more ghastly , right ? 
Oh , look ... I've just been knocked down by the Willow Roi for some ... you too ... this thing is so weird ... 
Willow Roi is hissing and clawing at a few branches . 
They can see that they diverged from one side to the other , avoiding the attack and trying to get near the tree . 
Then Willow Roi suddenly stood still . 
Hermione said : 
- Crookshanks click on the acupressure point of the tree . 
Harry whispered : 
- And so we go in ... 
We're all over . 
As soon as they had just disappeared into the niche under the tree , Willow Roi started screeching leaves . 
Seconds later , they heard footsteps approaching very close . 
Dumbledore , Mr. Fudge and the old commissioner were heading toward the castle . 
Hermione said : 
- Just after we just crawled down the tunnel ! 
The price that Dumbledore goes with us ... 
Said Harry , 
" And Fudge , the same captain of Macnair , was with us ! " 
I dare to bet anything that Mr. Fudge will order Mr. Macnair kill Sirius on the spot for that ... 
They watched as the four men climbed the steps to enter the castle and disappeared . 
The scene in front of the castle is quiet for a few minutes . 
Next ... 
- Lupine comes ! 
Harry said , as they saw another shadow running down the steps and hurrying to the Willow Roi . 
Harry looked up at the sky . 
Clouds completely covered the moon . 
The two boys saw Lupine picking up a broken branch in the yard to poke the knot on the willow tree . 
The tree stops whipping . 
And Lupine sneaked into the hole under the tree and disappeared . 
Harry said : 
- If you get a cloak jacket . 
It's right there ! 
Then he turned to Hermione and said , 
" If I'm running out now , Snape's going to have no way of getting it , and ... " 
- Harry , we do not let anyone see ! 
Harry frowned at Hermione : 
- How can you tolerate it ? 
Standing here and watching everything happen ? 
Then Harry hesitated : 
- I ' ll go get the invisibility cloak . 
- no , Harry ! 
Hermione clutched the knuckle on the dress worn by Harry , also at the right time . 
At that moment , they heard a voice singing . 
It was Hagrid who was just going to the castle , lifting his voice , his body slightly wobbling as he walked . 
In his waving hand was a bottle of wine . 
Hermione said : 
- See ? 
See what will happen ? 
We must not be seen ! no , Buckbeak ! 
The Mausoleum was struggling madly to find a way to return to Hagrid . 
Harry clutched the rope , trying to hold onto Buckbeak . 
They see Hagrid drunk , leaning on the castle . 
He was gone , Buckbeak stopped struggling to get out . 
He lowered his head sadly . 
Just two minutes later , the door to the castle opened again , and Snape snapped out , running toward Willow Roi . 
Harry's hand tightened as they saw Snape standing there beside the willow tree , looking around . 
He picked up the invisibility cloak . 
Harry murmured in his mouth : 
- let go of his dirty hands ! 
- Suit ! 
Snape's teacher uses the tree that Lupine used to press the lighter - point button , then disappears when he covers his invisibility cloak . 
Hermione quietly said : 
- So it happened ! 
We all came down here ... and now we only have water waiting until we go back up ... 
She secured the head of a rope that secured Buckbeak's neck to a safety pole around the nearby tree , then sat down on dry ground , wrapping her arms around her knees . 
- Harry , there are some things I can not understand ... 
Why did the Azkaban dictators not catch Sirius ? 
I remember they came , and I fainted ... 
They are so big ... 
Harry also sat down . 
She told Hermione what he had seen when the closest Azkhaban dictator put his mouth near Harry's mouth . Something of great silver draped across the lake and forced the Azkhaban dementors to withdraw . retreat . 
Hermione's mouth gaped as Harry finished telling the story : 
- But what is that ? 
Harry said : 
- There is only one possibility , to make the Azkaban dementors leave , that is a guardian god . 
A strong guardian god . 
- But who called the guardian god up ? 
Harry did not say anything . 
He was remembering the man he saw across the lake . 
He thinks he knows who that person is ... 
But how can that be ? 
Asked Hermione impatiently : 
- What does he look like ? Is that one of our professors ? 
Harry said : 
- No , he is not one of our teachers . 
- But there must be a really powerful magic to get rid of the Azkaban dementors go ... 
If the guardian god shines so bright , can not he always light up ? 
Can not you see ? 
Harry slowly said : 
- Yes , I saw him . 
But ... maybe I imagined ... at that time my mind was not very clear ... I fainted right after that ... 
- You think that person can be ? 
Harry swallowed his tongue , knowing that this would sound strange : 
- I think ... 
I thought it was my father . 
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw her mouth grow louder now . 
Little girl 
Harry looked at him with a look of both pity and anxiety . 
Hermione softened her voice to Harry : 
- Harry , your father ... 
Oh ... dead ! 
Harry said , 
- I know that . 
- You guessed you saw the ghost of the three of us ? 
- I do not know ... 
No , my dad looked so alive ... 
- But then ... 
- Maybe I have seen the illusion ... 
But ... by what I saw ... maybe it was my father ... 
I have pictures of you ... 
Hermione looked at Harry as if nervous Harry could be insane . 
Harry said bluntly : 
- I know that sounds crazy . 
She turned to look at Buckbeak , who was using a tombstone , obviously for worms . 
But Harry did not actually look at the Seahawks . 
He was thinking about his father , and about his three best friends ... 
Silly dreaming , worm tailed , Stuffed feet and Strings 
Did all four of them come together tonight ? The wormhole reappears when everyone believes that he is dead . 
Can not his father can do the same thing ? 
Had he been standing on the other side of the lake watching everything happen ? 
The picture was too far away so it was hard to see clearly ... but it felt distinctly in the moment before it passed out ... 
The leaves on Harry and Hermione's head were rustling in the wind . 
The moon floated into the clouds and floated away . 
Hermione sat facing Willow Roi , waiting . 
And finally , after an hour long ... 
Hermione whispered : 
- We're out ! 
She and Harry stood up . 
Buckbeak also raised his head . 
They saw Lupine , Ron , and Pettigrew clumsily peek out of the hole under the tree . 
Then came Hermione ... and then Snape's unconsciousness popped up , tenting in a very weird way . 
Next is Harry and Sirius . 
Now they are heading towards the castle . 
Harry's heart began to pound . 
He glanced up at the sky . 
Clouds are about to fly to reveal the moon ... 
Hermione moaned at Harry , as if she knew what Harry was thinking : 
- Harry , you have to stay in place . 
We are not allowed to see others . 
We can not do anything ... 
Harry said coldly : 
- Meaning I let Pettinggrew escape once again ? 
Hermione resists : 
- How did you find a rat in the dark ? 
We can not do anything . 
We turn back time is to save you 
Sirius is not doing anything else ! 
- OK ! 
The moon is coming out of the cloud . 
Two young children saw the tiny blurry silhouette in the school grounds suddenly stopped . 
Then they see the movement ... 
Hermione whispered : 
- Lupine , you are transforming ... 
Harry suddenly said : 
- Hermione , we have to move away now ! 
- No , I told you ... 
- Not to interfere ! 
But Lupine is about to run into the forest , running straight to us ! 
Hermione gasped . 
She hurriedly unplugged Buckbeak's belt , moaning : 
- Hurry up ! 
Hurry up ! 
Where are we going now ? 
Where are we hiding now ? 
The Azkhaban dementors are coming in a blink of an eye . 
Harry said : 
" Come back to Hagrid's house ! " 
Now there is no one in there ... go ahead ... 
They plugged their head on , the Buckbeak staggered behind them . 
And they can hear the chase from the back is the howling of the werewolf ... 
Hagrid's hut appeared in front of him . 
Harry ran to the door , twisting it open , Hermione and Buckbeak swept past him , crawling inside . 
Harry rushed behind and immediately closed the door . 
Fang barked at the garlic . 
- Suit , Fang ... we are here ! 
Hermione said as she hurried to the dog , scratching her ears to calm him . 
She said to Harry : 
- Someday , then ! 
- Ừ ... 
Harry was looking out the window . 
From here it is difficult to see what is happening out there . 
Buckbeak was so happy to find himself back at Hagrid's warmth . 
It lay down in front of the fireplace , the wings folded in accord with ease and seemed to be preparing for a good night's sleep . 
Harry slowly said : 
- You know , I think we should go out again . Here we can not see what's going on ... we can not know when the time is ... 
Harry looked up . 
She looked incredulous . 
Harry immediately said : 
- I will not find the way . 
But if we do not see what's going on , how do we know when it's time to save Sirius ? 
- Yeah ... yeah , well ... I ' ll wait here with Buckbeak ... but Harry , be careful ... there's a werewolf out there ... and the dementors Azkhaban again ... 
Harry walked out again and walked along the hut . 
He can hear the dog yelping 
in the distance . 
So that means the Azkhaban dementors are squeezing around Sirius ... 
He and Hermione will run to you for a moment ... 
Harry stared at the lake , his heart as if he were drumming in his chest . 
Certainly someone has called up the guardian god who is coming out now . 
For a moment Harry hesitated in front of Hagrid's house . " You can not be seen . " 
But it does not want to be seen . 
It wants to see it ... 
He must know ... 
And the Azkaban dementors . 
They spill out from the dark , from all directions , surf around the lake ... 
They were moving away from where Harry was standing , toward the other side of the lake . 
Harry is no longer close to them . 
Harry started running . 
There was no other thought in Harry's mind , except his father's image ... if that was his father ... if that person was really his father ... 
It must know ... it must find out ... 
The lake was closer and closer , but there was no sign of anyone else . On the other side of the street , Harry could only see the light of a silver streak , which was the weak guardian god he had called himself . 
At the edge of the water there was a bush , Harry plunged into the bushes in it , earnestly looking through the leaves . On the opposite side of the lake , silver light suddenly fades . 
A terrible thrill hit Harry ... 
Inside this moment ... 
He stared around , muttering : 
- Daddy , where are you three ? 
Three show off ! 
But no one appears . 
Harry raised his head to look at the encirclement of the Azkhaban dementors across the lake . 
One of the Azkhaban dementors pulled his face down . This is where the life saver Harry appeared ... but this time did not see him to help ... 
And suddenly , Harry awoke ... he suddenly understood . 
It did not actually see the three of them , but rather saw it . 
Harry threw himself out of the bushes and pulled out his wand . 
It screams : 
" EXPECTO PATRONUM ! " 
And from its wand , it was not a cloudless cloud , but a sparkling silver shine that shone brightly . 
Harry narrowed his eyes , trying to see what it was . 
It looks like a horse . 
The creature quietly galloped away from Harry , crossing the dark lake . 
Harry saw the creature bending his head down , attacking the Azkhaban dictator ... and then circling around the black shapes lying on the ground , and the Azkhaban dementors collapsed , scattering , and retreated into the shadows . evening ... 
Finally they disappeared . 
The god of the trot goes back , across the lake , toward Harry . that's not a horse . It's not a codeine . It's a deer , shining like the moon in the sky ... and back to Harry ... 
The deer stopped by the lake . 
Its nails do not leave marks on the soft ground , and it stares at Harry with his big , sparkling silver eyes , his head gagged with horns . 
And Harry realized ... 
" Deer antler ! " 
Harry whispered . 
But as his trembling fingers reached out toward the animal , the animal disappeared . 
Harry stood there , still reaching out . 
Then Harry felt his heart pounding as he heard the hooves clanging behind him . 
Harry turned around and saw Hermione running towards him , pulling Buckbeak behind him . 
Said Hermione , 
- What did you do ? 
You said you just went out to watch it ! 
Harry said : 
- I'm just saving our lives ... 
Hide behind this bush 
I will explain ... 
Hermione listened to what had just happened to her gaping mouth again . 
- Did anyone see you ? 
- Yes , you did not hear ? 
I see me but I think I'm my dad ! 
It is ok ! 
- Harry , I can not believe it . 
You call up a guardian god enough power to expel the Azkhaban dementors ... it's a very , very powerful magic . 
Harry said : 
- I know this time I can do it , because I've done it before ... 
Do you think so ? 
- I do not know ... 
Harry , look at Snape ! 
Both peered through the bushes looking toward the lake . 
Seeing Snape wake up . 
He was giving in to the tapes and was picking up Harry's frozen bodies , Hermione and Sirius laying on the tape . 
A fourth cauldron , probably Ron's carrying , was floating beside him . 
Then , with his wand in his hand , Snape controlled all the gangs moving toward the castle . 
Hermione looked at her wristwatch , saying tensely : 
- Good , almost time . 
We forty - five minutes , until Dumbledore locked the door of the sick room . 
We must save Sirius and return to the sick room before someone realizes our absence ... 
They waited , watching the clouds flowing under the lake , while the bushes next to them rustled in the wind . 
Buckbeak was already bored , and he was looking for worms to eat . 
Harry looked at the clock . 
She looked up at the castle , began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower : 
- Do you think Sirius is up there ? 
Hermione whispered : 
- Look ! 
Who's that ? 
Someone is coming out of the castle ! 
Harry stared through the darkness . 
The man rushed across the school grounds , heading for one of the entrance gates . Wearing his waist was something shiny . 
Harry said : 
- Macnair ! 
The name of the executioner ! 
He called the dementors of Azkaban ! 
It's about time , Hermione ... 
Hermione put her hand on Buckbeak's back and Harry helped her up . 
Then Harry set his foot on one of the low branches of the bush to climb up the back of the baby 
Code and sit in front of Hermione . 
He pulled the end of the rope that had buckled Buckbeak's neck and tied it around the other side of Buckbeak's necklace , making something like a reed . 
Then he whispered to Hermione : 
- Ready ? 
So you should be better off ... 
Harry pushed his heels against Buckbeak's hips . 
The Mausoleum soared into dark space . 
Harry clamped his knees tightly to the sides of Bang - hs's son , feeling the wind rising up beneath them . 
Hermione hugged Harry's hips tight , and she could hear Hermione murmuring : 
- Oh ... 
no ... i do not like this at all ... 
Oh , I do not really like flying this little bit ! 
Harry pushed Buckbeak forward . 
They were silently gliding up the high floors of the castle . 
Harry pulled up the rope on the left , and Buckbeak swung around . 
Harry tried to count the window frames glance . 
- Gosh ! 
Harry dragged the " reins " backwards . 
Buckbeak slowed down and then they stopped , as if stopping if they did not even notice the fact that they had to rise up a few feet when the Bang Ma flapped their wings to keep their balance in the air . 
- He's here ! 
Harry shouted as they emerged outside a window and saw Sirius . 
Harry leaned forward , waiting for Buckbeak's wings to descend , and he slammed into the window . 
Sirius looked up . 
Harry saw his mouth gap open . 
He jumped out of the sitting chair , rushed to the window and tried to open it , but the window was locked . 
Hermione shouted to Sirius , 
- Come back ! 
She withdrew the wand , her left hand clutching Harry's back , the mantra : 
" Alohomora ! " 
The window opened . 
Sirius looked at Buckbeak , weak voice : 
- How do you ... ? 
Harry gripped Buckbeak's silky neck to keep it quiet and said , 
- Uncle climb up quickly ... 
We do not have much time ... 
You have to get out of here right now ... 
The Azkhaban dementors are coming . 
Macnair went out and called them . 
Sirius put his hand on the window frame , lifting his head and shoulders to crawl out . 
Luckily Sirius was sick . 
In just a few seconds , he managed to put a foot on Buckbeak's back , then put both of them on the back of the Equator , sitting firmly behind Hermione . 
Harry snatches the rope : 
- okay , fly up , Buckbeak ! 
Fly to the top of the tower ... 
Fly up ! 
Ma Bang Ma fluttered its mighty wings and lifted the three soaring up to the top of the West Tower . 
Buckbeak landed on the wall with a hole in the wind that caused the clamor . 
Harry and Hermione immediately slipped off the equator . 
Said Harry in a panting breath : 
- Sirius , you should go now , hurry up ! 
It's just that they will go to Flitwick's office , and they ' ll find out you're gone ! 
Buckbeak stomped his feet to the floor , shaking his head . 
Sirius asked urgently : 
- What about that boy ? 
Ron ? 
- It will recover quickly ... 
It's still not awake , but Mrs Pomfrey says she can make it better . 
Go ahead ... go away ... 
But Sirius still stared at Harry's face : 
- How did the temple respond ? 
Both Harry and Hermione shouted : 
- PLEASE ! 
Sirius turned the Buckbeak back toward the vast sky . 
He said the last sentence : 
- We ' ll meet Again ... 
You're right ... it's my dad's son , Harry ! 
Climb the heel of Buckbeak . 
Harry and Hermione leaped back as the great wings of Bangmai patted again ... then the Airship soared into space ... 
Harry stared at the ball of Seamus and his rider fell , gradually narrowing ... 
A cloud of clouds drifting across the moon ... they flew away . 
Chapter 22 
THE BOX 
- Harry . 
Hermione pulled Harry's sleeve , staring at her wristwatch : 
- We still have ten minutes to go back to the ventricular not seen by anyone ... must come down before Dumbledore locked the door of the hospital .... 
Harry stopped staring at the sky , saying : 
- Yeah ... let's go .... 
They sneaked through the back corridor and down an extremely narrow rock staircase . 
When they reached the foot of the stairs , suddenly heard a sound , immediately they stick close to the wall and listen ear . 
It looks like Snape and Fudge are coming . 
They are walking very fast along the corridor at the foot of the stairs . 
Master Snape : 
" ... just wish Dumbledore not make more trouble . 
Will the kiss of the Azkhaban dictator be done immediately ? . 
As soon as Macnair returned to the Azkaban dementors . 
The whole case of prisoners escaped Black Black is losing face . 
I can not tell you all that I was waiting for them to be informed of the Prophecy newspaper that we finally got the prisoner . 
I dare say they will ask for an interview with him , Mr. Snape ... and once the little boy is awake , I hope he tells the Prophet he saved the boy . how ... . 
Harry gritted his teeth . 
It caught Snape's pretentious smile as he and Fudge walked past the two of them who were hiding . 
Their feet faded , Harry and Hermione waited a little more to be sure they had already gone , then started running in the opposite direction . 
Run down another stair , then another staircase , running along the corridor ... suddenly they hear giggle in front . 
Harry grasped Hermione's wrist , whispering : 
- The demon Peeves , avoid here ! . 
Two boys in an empty room on the left , just in time . 
Peeves seemed to be lounging along the corridor with exhilarated cheer , in the spirit of ready to stir and laugh at the output . 
Hermione pressed her ear to the door . 
She whispered : 
- Oh ... he's so bad ! 
I bet he is happy because the Azkhaban dementors are coming to Sirius's soul .... 
She checked the hours , exclaimed : 
- Only three minutes left , Harry .... 
They had to wait until Peeves ' gloomy voice died away , and then sneaked out of the room and backed off . 
Harry gasped and said , 
- Hermione ... what will happen ... if we can not go back to the room ... before Dumbledore locked the door ? . 
Hermione moaned : 
- I do not want to think of that ! . 
She looked at the clock again . 
- One more minute ! . 
They rushed to the end of the corridor with the entrance to the ventricles , Hermione listened attentively and said : 
- okay ... I heard Dumbledore's voice . come on , Harry ! . 
The two children crept along the corridor . 
The door to the room opened , they saw Dumbledore's back , and heard the master saying : 
- You are about to lock the door to lock the children in this . 
In five minutes , until midnight , Granger , in just three turns , had to finish . 
Wish you good luck . . 
Dumbledore stepped out of the room , closing the door . 
Horrified , Harry and Hermione rushed forward . 
Dumbledore looked up and a bright smile broadened beneath his long mustache . 
Small question : 
- Star ? . 
Harry said , short of breath : 
- We're done ! , Uncle Sirius escaped , rode off Buckbeak ! . 
Dumbledore smiled at the two young children : 
- Good , I think .... 
Dumbledore paused , listening intently to any sound in the sickness : 
- Finished , I think the two children have just finished . 
You're okay 
No ... you will lock the door to lock the children again .... 
Harry and Hermione went through the room . 
The room was empty , except Ron was still lying on the bed at the back of the room . 
When the door lock rang behind Harry and Hermione , they crawled into bed . 
Hermione put the time in her shirt . 
Just a moment later , Mrs. Pomfrey stepped out of her office : 
- I hear the principal is gone then ? 
Can I now take care of my patients ? . 
Pomfrey was in a state of unhappiness . 
Harry and Hermione thought it best that they obediently pick up the chocolate bars they ate . 
Mrs. Pomfrey stood next to them , to make sure they had eaten all the chocolate . 
But Harry could not swallow it . 
He and Hermione were anxiously waiting , listening , their nerves stretching like strings . 
And then , when they pick up Pomfrey's fourth chocolate , they hear an angry roar echoing from somewhere , somewhere like it's coming from above . 
Mrs. Pomfrey panicked . 
- What else ? . 
Now they can hear that angry voice grow louder and louder . 
Mrs. Pomfrey glared out the door . 
- Strongly speaking ! 
They woke up everyone up ! 
What do they think they are doing ? . 
Harry tried to hear the voices of the people , closer and closer . 
" He must have been territorial , Mr. Snape . 
We should have him back in his room . 
If this came out .... 
Snape snarled , now his voice was heard outside the door : 
- HE DO NOT LIFE , YOU CAN NOT MAKE ANYTHING OR MOMENT IN THIS LAND ! STORY - THIS - HAPPY - HAPPY - HAVE - HAPPY - HAPPY - UP - HARRY POTTER ! . 
- Mr. Snape , speak up a little bit ... 
Harry is locked in the room .... 
LEFT ! 
The door to the room opened . 
Both Snape , Fudge and Dumbledore strode into the room . 
Dumbledore's only appearance is his delicate look . It seems that the stuff seems to be just another whimper . 
Mr. Fudge was angry . 
But Snape is no longer a teacher . 
He shouted : 
- OPEN , POTTER ! WHAT DO YOU DO ? . 
Mrs. Pomfrey shrieked . 
- Professor Snape ! 
You have to control yourself ! . 
- Mr. Snape , look here . 
Justify the reason : the door is locked , we just saw that .... 
- HELP DOCTOR , I KNOW ! . 
Snape snapped , pointing at Harry and Hermione . 
His face twisted crooked distorted , water splashed lum . 
Mr. Fudge shouted : 
- Calm down ! 
You're talking about the irritating jargon ! . 
Snape snapped through his teeth : 
- DO NOT KNOW POTTER ! IT HAS LOVED IT , I KNOW IT HAS MADE IT ! . 
Dumbledore said gently : 
- Okay , Snape , teacher ! 
Think what you just said . 
The door was locked when I left the ward ten minutes ago . 
Mrs. Pomfrey , do you see these kids getting out of bed ? . 
- Of course not ! . 
Mrs. Pomfrey was horrified : 
- I have been with them since he left this place . . 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- that's Snape , you see . 
Unless you think Harry and Hermione can be in two places at the same time , I suppose we have no reason to bother them anymore . . 
Snape's teacher stood there , frowning at the edge , peering at Fudge to Dumbledore . 
Mr. Fudge was completely amazed at Snape's attitude , and Dumbledore flashed his glittering eyes behind the half moon glasses . 
Snape Snape turned around , his lap sloping round , the heroic tiger stepped out of the room . 
Mr. Fudge looked at Snape , 
- He does not seem to be balanced . 
Dumbledore , if I were a man , I would keep an eye on him . . 
Dumbledore said gently : 
- Oh , he was not balanced . 
He was just a serious disappointment ! . 
Mr. Fudge breathed one : 
- He was not the only one who was disappointed ! 
The prophetess will spoil the gibbons ! 
Sirius has netted the law , but then slipped through our fingers again ! 
Now they just need to blow up the story of the escape of Bang Bang up to the galaxy to laugh back to me ! 
Well , I have to go here , to report to the Ministry of Magic .... 
Dumbledore asked : 
- And the dementors of Azkaban ? 
Now let them pull out of my Hogwarts school ? . 
Mr. Fudge tapped his fingers through the hair on his head : 
- Yeah ... yes , they will have to go . 
It is unbelievable that they are planning to kiss on an innocent child ... completely beyond control . 
No , I will send them back to the Azkhaban jail tonight ! 
Perhaps we have to consider sending the dragons to the gate of Hogwarts .... 
Dumbledore said with a flashing smile to Harry and Hermione : 
- Hagrid will enjoy it ! . 
When Mr. Fudge came out of the room , Mrs. Pom rushed to the door and locked it again . 
Then she angrily murmured to herself , just go to his office . 
From the end of the room , a soft moan sounded . 
Ron was awake . 
Harry and Hermione could see Ron sitting up , rubbing his eyes , looking around . 
Moaning : 
- What happened ? 
Harry ? 
Why are we here ? 
Where's Sirius ? Where is Lupine ? What's happening ? . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other , and then Harry took a few chocolates , and told Hermione , 
- Bo explain it ! . 
oOo 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione left the hospital the following afternoon , they found the entire castle was empty . 
The heat was peeling and the exam ended which meant that everyone had gone to visit Hogsmeade Village . 
However , both Ron and Hermione did not feel like going , so the two of them with Harry roamed on the school grounds , continuing to talk about the extraordinary events that occurred the night before , and wondered now . Sirius and Lupine are nowhere . 
Harry sat on the edge of the lake , watching the giant squirrels lunge the tentacles in water lazyly . 
She did not pay attention to the story being told when she looked across the lake . 
Only last night , from there , the deer galloped toward Harry . 
A shadow fell on the children's seats . They looked up and saw Hagrid's eyes as he wiped his sweaty face with one of his big handkerchiefs . 
He grinned at the three young children and sat down next to them : 
- Uncle knew I should not be happy after what happened last night . What do you think of the Black case to escape , and other things ... but you guessed .... 
The three little children pretended curiosity : 
- What is it ? . 
- Beaky ! 
It escaped ! 
It was free ! 
You celebrated all night ! . 
- That is awesome ! . 
Said Hermione , looking up at Ron to see Ron seemingly laughing . 
Hagrid looked at the school grounds , murmuring : 
- Yeah ... I'm sure he tied it tight ... 
This morning I was still worried ... I think it might have hit Professor Lupine in the yard , but Lupine said yesterday he did not eat anything .... 
Harry asked quickly : 
- What do you say ? . 
Hagrid's smile slightly withered a little : 
- Men , did not you hear anything ? . 
Hagrid lowered his voice , though there was no other man around him : 
- Yeah ... this morning Snape told the Slytherins ... now everybody must know ... 
Professor Lupine is a werewolf , do you understand ? 
And he was out in the yard this morning . 
Of course he is arranging luggage now . 
Harry exclaimed , 
- Are you arranging your luggage ? 
Why so ? . 
Hagrid was surprised that Harry had to ask : 
- to leave but why ? 
The first thing he had to do this morning was to take a break from teaching . 
He said he could not risk letting it happen again .... 
Harry hurried to his feet . 
He told Ron and Hermione : 
- I have to go to see you . 
- But if you ask for vacation .... 
- ... we can not do anything .... 
- I do not need to know . 
I still want to see you . 
I will return to meet you two here . 
oOo 
Lupine's office door to open . 
He packed most of his belongings . 
The empty Grindylow tank was empty next to the worn - out suitcase and the lid was nearly full . 
Lupine was bending over something on his desk and only raised his head as Harry knocked on the door . 
Lupine smiled 
- You have seen me . 
He pointed at the parchment spread over the table that he had been examining . It is a map of the hijackers . 
Harry said : 
- I just met Hagrid , he said he had stopped teaching . 
Is not that right ? . 
Lupine opened the desk drawer and took out the contents . 
- I'm so right ! . 
Harry said : 
- Why ? 
The Ministry of Magic has accused him to help Sirius fugitives , right ? . 
Lupine walked to the door , closing it behind Harry : 
- No , Professor Dumbledore tried to convince Mr. Fudge that he just tried to save your life . 
And it was a drop of water for Snape . 
He thought it was Merlin who lost his medal . 
This morning when breakfast , he ... 
er ... accidentally revealed that he is a werewolf . 
Harry said : 
- Do not leave because of that ! . 
Lupine smiled miserably : 
- Tomorrow at this time , the owls from the parents will fly to ... 
People do not want a wolf to teach their children , Harry . 
And right after yesterday night , he realized they were right . 
You may very well bite your children ... 
Can not let that happen again . 
Harry said : 
- You are the best Professor of Anti - Artistic Arts we have ever studied ! 
Please do not go ! . 
Lupine shook his head , saying nothing . 
He continued to empty the drawers . 
Suddenly , while Harry was trying to think of a reason to persuade Lupine to stay , he said , 
- Based on what the principal told me this morning , I saved many lives last night . 
Harry , if you have something to be proud of , that's the pride of what you've learned . 
Tell me about your guardian spirit . . 
Harry looked blankly : 
- How do you know that ? . 
- What else could the Azkhaban dementors push back ? . 
Harry told Lupine what had happened . 
When it was finished , Lupine smiled again . 
He said : 
- yes , when the animal is transformed , my father always turns into a deer . 
I guess that's right ... so that's why my friends called his deer gauze . 
Lupine threw his last book in his suitcase , closed the drawer and looked back at Harry . 
He gave Harry the invisibility cloak and said , 
- Here ... you brought this one from the Tent at night yesterday . 
And .... 
He hesitated , but then also gave Harry the map of the hackers . 
- You are no longer my teacher , so you do not feel guilty about returning this map . 
It is not useful for me . 
And you dare say that you , along with Ron and Hermione will have room to spend it . 
Harry holds the map , grinning ; 
- I used to tell you that silly dream , worm tailed , Stuffed legs and Struggle to lure children out of school ... teacher said they think so is fun .... 
Lupine bent down and closed his suitcase . 
- And we did . 
He was not afraid to say how desperate James would be if the son of the photo never found the secret passage out of the castle . 
With a knock on the door , Harry hastily stuffed the map of the pirate and the invisibility cloak in his pocket . 
The one who came was Professor Dumbledore . 
He did not seem surprised to see Harry there . 
He said : 
My car is waiting outside the gate , Remus . 
- Thank you President . 
Lupine took an old worn suitcase and needed an empty Grindylow basin . 
He smiled : 
- Well ... goodbye , Harry ! Being taught is a great happiness to you . 
I'm sure there will be times when we meet again . 
Mr. President , you do not have to take me out to the gate , I can take care of myself . 
Harry felt that Lupine wanted to leave soon , as soon as possible . 
Dumbledore said calmly : 
- Then bye , Remus ! . 
Lupine moved the Grindylow to the other hand so he could shake Dumbledore's hand . 
Then , nodding his last nod to Harry , with a miserable smile , Lupine left the office . 
Harry plopped down on the empty chair of his teacher , staring down at the floor . 
He heard the door shut and raised his head . 
Dumbledore is still there . 
Speaking softly : 
- How sad , Harry ? 
You should be proud of what happened last night ! . 
- Can not change anything , teacher ? 
Pettigrew still escapes ! . 
Dumbledore quietly said : 
- Do not change anything ? 
Harry , that changed all in this world . 
You helped the truth to be exposed . 
I saved an innocent person from a terrible destiny . 
Terrible . 
Something had just risen up in Harry's memory . 
Greater and more terrible than ever . 
The prophecy of Professor Trelawney ! 
- Dumbledore , yesterday , when we were testing the Prophet , Professor Trelawney suddenly became ... strange . 
Dumbledore asked : 
- Really ? 
Oh ... do you mean it's weird than usual ? . 
" Yes ... " Her voice suddenly deepened and her eyes widened and she said ... She said Voldemort's men were about to come out and return to his subordinate before midnight . 
She also told her servants to help him restore his power . . 
Harry looked up at Dumbledore 
- And then suddenly she returned to normal , and she told her she could not recall anything she had said . 
Are you ... have predicted right , right ? . 
Dumbledore was a little moved . 
He said with a pensive look : 
" Do you know , Harry ? " 
I think it is . 
Who can think of that ! 
This makes the total number of her predictions accurate to two . 
You have to raise her salary .... 
Harry stared at Dumbledore . 
How can you justify it ? 
- But ... I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupine from killing Pettinggrew ! 
So if Voldemort restored power then that was your fault . . 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
- Not where , back to what time did not teach me something ? 
The consequences of our actions are always so complex , so varied , that predicting the future is actually a very difficult task . 
Professor Trelawney - merit to her - she is a living proof palpable . 
I made a noble gesture to spare Pettigrew's life . 
- But if he helps Voldemort recover power .... 
- Pettigrew owes his life . 
I sent Voldemort a life saving helper with me , When a witch saves another sorcerer , between them will establish some kind of meaningfulness ... and he will make a big mistake if he thinks Voldemort wants his underlings owed Harry Potter ! . 
Harry said : 
- I do not want to have anything to do with Pettinggrew ! 
He had to bump into my cheeks ! . 
- this mystery to the depths , the agnostic of magic , Harry . 
But believe me ... it will be some time that I will be happy that you saved the life of Pettigrew ! . 
Harry could not imagine when he would come that moment . 
Dumbledore seemed to know what Harry was thinking . 
He said affectionately : 
- You know my father very well , even when your father was in Hogwarts school and later . 
Harry , I know for sure that three children will save Pettigrew . 
Harry looked up at Dumbledore . 
Surely Dumbledore did not smile ... he could tell you ... 
- Last night ... I thought it was your father calling his guardian god . I mean when you see the other side of the lake ... I thought you saw me .... 
Dumbledore said softly : 
- that is easy to confuse . 
I thought I was bored of this , but I was just like James in a strange way . 
Except for my eyes ... I have your mother's eyes . 
Harry shook his head , muttering : 
- You are stupid to think it's your father . I mean , I know your father was dead .... 
" Do you think the dead we love really leave us ? " 
Do you think we can never remember them more clearly than ever before when we were in the worst trouble ? 
My dad is still alive in me , Harry , and when you need your daddy , he's clearly in front of you . 
No , how can I call that special guardian god ? Last night , Gau deer back to back . . 
Harry took a moment to understand what Dumbledore said . 
Smiling continued : 
- Last night Sirius had told him about how they had transformed the fake . 
A feat ... at least the feat is hidden when the teacher . 
And then he recaptured the most abnormal form of the Guardian of the Guardian , when the gods kicked Malfoy out of the Quidditch match with the Ravenclaw squad . 
Well , I saw your father last night , Harry ... 
I found your father inside of you . 
And Dumbledore left the office , leaving Harry with his confused thoughts . 
oOo 
No one at Hogwarts knew the truth about what had happened the night Sirius , Buckbeak and Pettigrew had disappeared except Harry , Ron , Hermione and Professor Dumbledore . 
As the semester was nearing its end , Harry heard a number of different assumptions about what really happened , with no real assumption . 
Malfoy was very upset about Buckbeak . 
It was unconvincing that Hagrid had smuggled the Bangma into a safe place , and it was even more insane because it was as good as it was and all three of them were blocked by a senpai . 
At the time , Percy Weasley had much to debate about Sirius's escape . 
He told the only person to hear him say , it was Penelope - his girlfriend : 
- If you go to the Ministry of Magic , you will have a lot of recommendations on the implementation of the Law of Magic . 
Although the weather was perfect , although the atmosphere was very cheerful , although Harry knew they had made a feat in helping Sirius escape , he had never experienced it . The end of the school year is in a worse mood than this . 
Certainly Harry was not the only one to regret when Lupine gave up . 
Both Harry's Dark Arts Defense class was mourning the resignation of his teacher . 
Seamus Finnigan grumbled : 
- Do not know next year they will send someone to teach us ? . 
Dean Thomas offers a great hope : 
- Maybe a vampire . 
Not every Lupine story went that Harry was so heavy . 
It can not help thinking much to the prophecy of Professor Trelawney . 
He wondered where Pettinggrew was now , did he know that he had found Voldemort's cave ? 
But what makes Harry's morale worst is the prospect of returning to the Dursleys . At some point in half an hour , or more than half an hour's splendor of his life , he thought he would return to live with Sirius , godfather and best friend of his father . The most beautiful thing in the world , after the super nice thing is that her parents came alive with it . 
And although there was no news of Sirius , it was a good news , because it meant he successfully defected , but Harry could not help but feel miserable when he thought of the family roof . It should have been , but now it turns out to be unthinkable . 
Exam results are announced on the last day of the school year . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione passed all subjects . 
Harry was amazed to find himself through the poison . 
He suspected that Dumbledore had intervened so that Snape could not deliberately drop it . 
Snape's attitude towards Harry in the last week was scary . 
Anyway now Harry thinks Snape hates it all , it can not think that Snape's hatred of him can be increased , but Snape hates it a lot more . 
Every time Snape saw Harry's face was a facial muscular near the mouth of his thin back again uncomfortably . 
Then his fingers twitched as if they were itching to place Harry's throat tightening . 
Percy was named . N . E . W . Ts . Short for the Nastily Exhauting Wizarding Test , Fred and George have the odds of finding an OW . L ( Ordinary Wizarding Level ) shortcut . 
At the same time , Gryffindor won the home league title three consecutive years , thanks to outstanding play in the Quidditch Cup . 
And so , when the closing ceremonies of the school year took place in the halls of glowing purple and yellow , the Gryffindor table was the loudest among the crowd celebrating the end of the school year . 
Even Harry found a way to eat and laugh with the rest of the family to forget about returning to the Dursley family the next day . 
oOo 
When Hogwarts departs the station the next morning , Hermione tells Harry and Ron something surprising : 
- This morning I went to Professor Mc Gonagall , just before breakfast . 
I decided to leave Muggle study . . 
Said Ron : 
- But you passed with the results of three hundred and twenty percent . . 
Hermione sighed : 
- I know . 
But I can not stand another year like this again . 
Time Spinning makes me go crazy . 
I sent it back to Professor Mc Gonagall . 
Without Muggle studies and Prophecy , the schedule is back to normal . 
Ron still said in a loud voice : 
- I still can not believe you have hidden this story . 
We think this is your friend ! . 
Cried Hermione . 
- I promised not to tell anyone ! . 
She looked around for Harry . 
He was looking at Hogwarts from behind a mountain . 
It was not until two months later that Harry saw his dear school again . 
Hermione said sadly : 
- Oh , cheer up , Harry . 
Harry said quickly : 
- I'm fine . 
Just thinking of the holidays .... 
Said Ron : 
- Oh , I'm thinking about summer days too . 
Harry , you have to come and stay at your house . 
I will discuss with my parents , then I will call you . 
Now I know how to use the phone .... 
Hermione said : 
- Ron , that's a phone call . 
Really see you next year should learn Muggle class . 
Ron did not care about her : 
- This summer is the Quidditch World Cup season ! 
How are you , Harry ? 
Go to your house , we will go together . 
My father is still the work for children . . 
This offer stimulates Harry a lot of excitement : 
- Oh , I dare to bet that the family will be happy to let go ... especially after Miss Marge .... 
Feeling a lot happier , Harry played explosives with Ron and Hermione , and when the witch pushed the cart of drinks out of sight , Harry bought them all for a great lunch , except for those with chocolates . ... 
But by noon , what made Harry really happy was happening ... 
Hermione looked over Harry's shoulder , suddenly said : 
- Harry , what is there out of the window where you sit ? . 
Harry turned his head to look out . 
Something very small , gray , flickering when hidden outside the glass . 
Harry stood up to look more closely and realized it was a tiny owl carrying a letter too large for it . It was a little too small , so much so that it kept pushing the cat in mid - air , struggling with the air flowing from the fast - moving Hogwarts . 
Harry hurriedly pulled down the window , reaching out to catch the owl . 
Harry holds the owl in his hand and feels like a ruffled Snitch . 
He carefully took the bird into the train car . 
The owl dropped the letter into Harry's seat and began hovering round the train of children , obviously very happy to have completed the work satisfactorily . 
The owl hedwig copied the beak with a kind of disparaging arrogance . 
Crookshanks sat up straight , lifting his big yellow eyes to the owl . 
Ron realizes this immediately snatches the owl out of danger around the cat . 
Harry picked up the letter . 
Letter to Harry . 
He tore the envelope , opened it , and screamed . 
- Letter from Sirius ! . 
Ron and Hermione nervously shouted : 
- What , read up for us to hear this ! . 
Dear Harry . 
I hope you receive this letter before coming back to your aunt's house , I do not know if they are used to owl mailboxes . 
Buckbeak and uncle are in the hideout . 
I will not tell you where , in case this letter falls on someone else's hand . 
He was slightly suspicious of the level of trustworthiness of the owl , but this owl was the best he could find , and he was eagerly assigned to work . 
I believe that the Azkhaban dementors are still searching for them , but they will not have the hope of finding you here . 
He was planning to expose some of the Muggles to see him , sooner or later , away from Hogwarts , so that the castle guard was removed . 
There is one thing that you can not tell me at a brief meeting between my nephew . 
It was the person who sent the lightning bolt . 
Cried Hermione triumphantly : 
- See ! 
I told him that his broom ! . 
Said Ron : 
- Yes , that's the only thing he does not like to bite the broom , is not he ? . 
The tiny owl was snuggling up Ron's hand . 
He gulped Ron's fingers in a way that could have been beloved , making Ron groan softly . . 
Crookshanks ordered a mail order . 
Note the recipient of the child , but told them to pay the gold from the Gringotts treasury of seven hundred and eleven , his account . 
Consider it as the godfather's thirteenth birthday gift . 
I also want to apologize for the horror that you think you caused me , on that night last year , when you left your aunt's house . 
I just wanted to see you one before you started the journey to the North , but he thought maybe his outlook had scared him . 
Attach this to your child , which he thinks will make his new school year at Hogwarts more enjoyable . 
If I ever need you , keep writing , my owl will find you . 
I will write to you soon . 
Sirius . 
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope : there was another piece of parchment inside . 
He reads very fast and suddenly feels warm and satisfied as if he had just drunk a bottle of avocado . 
I , Sirius , godfather of Harry Potter , signed below allows Harry to visit Hogsmeade village on weekends . 
Harry rejoiced : 
- To Dumbledore , this is so good ! . 
He looked behind Sirius ' letter : 
- Wait , there's another pen nè .... 
I think your friend , Ron , might like to keep this owl , because of his fault that Ron is no longer a mouse . 
Ron's eyes opened . 
The little owl still exclaimed excitement . 
Ron said hesitantly : 
- Hold it ? . 
He looked closely at the owl for a moment , then , before the amazement of Harry and Hermione , Ron handed the owl out to Crookshanks for sniffing . 
Ron asked the cat : 
- What do you see ? 
Surely it is ? . 
Cat grimace 
Ron said happily : 
- That's OK . 
This owl is mine ! . 
Harry reads it again as Sirius sends it all the way back to King's Cross Station . 
The letter was still clutched in his hand , and when it , Ron and Hermione walked through the railing of the nine - thirds train station , Harry saw Uncle Vernon immediately . 
He stood far away from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley , watching them incredulously , and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry to greet him , his worst suspicion was confirmed . 
- I ' ll call you about the World Cup ! . 
Ron called Harry as he bid her goodbye and Hermione , then Harry pushed the car carrying the chest and the Hedwig cage toward Uncle Vernon . 
Uncle pick it up by his usual style : 
- Something ? . 
Leaning , glaring at the letter grasped in Harry's hand : 
- If you give another one for the sign , you will receive one more .... 
Harry happily said : 
- Not from where , this is the letter of your godfather . 
Uncle Vernon stammered : 
- Father ... godfather ? 
What do you have godfather ? . 
Harry said brightly : 
- Yes , yes ! 
He is my best friend and mother . 
He was accused of murder , but he escaped the witch and now is training . 
Still , he wants to keep in touch with his children ... want to know your news ... see if you are happy .... 
In Uncle Vernon's horrified look , Harry grinned and started walking toward the exit of the station . 
Hedwig croaked in front of Harry , for the prospect of a brighter summer than last year .
