Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 
Chapter 1 The Riddle House 
The small Hangleton village still calls it the Riddle House , although it has been years since the Riddle family lived there . 
The house was on a hilltop overlooking some of the village , some windows were cluttered with planks , roofing tiles pierced the hole , and free - flowing spring rolls spread over the front of the house . 
Once upon a time , the house was a beautiful mansion , a mile away . It was also the largest , most luxurious house , but now the Riddle House is just a place of ruins , damp , no owner , no visitors . 
The small village of Hangleton agreed that the old house was " scary " . 
Half a century ago , a strange and horrible thing happened there , something that the elders in the village are still discussing when the problem is gone . 
The story has been told many times over , and has been embroidered in so many places that no one is sure what the truth is . 
However , every version of the story starts with a place : five years ago , the Riddle House is flourishing , well - groomed , magnificent ; At the dawn of a beautiful day , a maid came into the living room , and discovered that all three of the Riddles were dead . 
The maid just ran down the hill to the village , waking up all the people she could wake up to : 
" That's where my eyes are ! 
As cold as ice ! 
Still dressed solemnly ! 
" 
The police were called in , and the small village of Hangleton boiled up to full of impudent excitement and excitement trying to hide it . 
Nor did anyone pretend to be saddened by what the Riddle family did , because the Riddle was unpopular . 
The Riddle are wealthy , snobby , impolite ; and their grown son - Tom - if it is different then only in the worse . All the villagers are concerned about the murderer's identity , as it is clear that three healthy adults can not suddenly die overnight for some common cause . 
Dead Man's Wine Shop suddenly sells expensive clothes that night ; Nearly all the villages pulled together to talk about the murderers . 
Those who were hard - pressed to leave their cozy seats by the fireplace of their homes were finally rewarded as the Riddle's cook came abruptly to join them and proclaimed to the silent bar that a man named Frank Bryce has just been arrested . 
Many people exclaim : 
" Frank ? 
No way ! " 
Frank Bryce is the gardener of the Riddle House . 
He lived alone in the rickety mansion in the garden of the Riddle House . 
Frank came back from the battlefield with a limp and a dislike of the crowd , hated noises . 
And he has worked for the Riddle family since . 
Everyone gathered to buy something cold for her kitchen to hear more details . 
After the fourth glass of wine , the cook told the villagers who were eager to listen : 
" I always find that guy crazy . 
Serious is lack of friendliness . 
I know for sure that if I could get one of those chips I would have invited you a hundred times already . 
No way to integrate , boy is not that ! " A woman in the bar said , 
" Well , by the way , he's been through a cruel war , Frank . 
He preferred a quiet life . 
There is no reason to ... " 
The cook said : 
" Then who else has the key behind the door ? 
As far as I remember , there was a key in the hut of a gardener ! 
Yesterday night no one broke the door in the house ! 
No windows were smashed ! 
Frank's only good job is to crept up to the Riddle House when we were all sleeping ... " 
The villagers exchanged eyes with dark eyes . 
A man behind the bar grumble : 
" You always think that guy has a dirty look , that's the way it is . " 
The owner said : 
" In my opinion , it was the war that turned him into a weirdo . 
" 
A lively girl in the corner of the room said , 
" Tell me , remember me Dot , I do not want to have trouble with that Frank . " 
Dot warmly agrees : 
" Hot temperament . 
I remember when he was a kid .... " 
Next morning , there was hardly anyone in the small Hangleton village who did not believe that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddle . 
But in the Big Hangleton town , in the dark and filthy police station , Frank stubbornly repeated that innocent man , the only man he had seen near the Riddle House on the day This house was killed by a stranger ten years old , with black hair and pale skin . 
In the village no one had ever seen such a boy , and the policeman was just the guy who made up that boy . 
Then , just as things became serious for Frank Bryce , the Riddler's autopsy report arrived and changed everything . 
Police have never read a more weird report . 
A team of doctors examined the corpse and concluded that none of the three Riddle died due to poisoning . 
Just as you do not die from being stabbed , shot , choked , chewed , or ( as you can see ) beaten or hurt . 
In fact , the Riddles were perfectly healthy - not to mention the fact that they were dead . 
Doctors have noted ( as determined to find out what's wrong with all the bodies ) that on the faces of every Riddler's dead have a look of horror .... 
But some angry policemen said that when people heard that three people were afraid to die in the episode ? 
Because there was no evidence that the Riddle was assassinated , the police released Frank . 
The Riddle family were buried in the small Hangleton cemetery , and their tombs became a curious object for a long time . 
But what surprised everyone was that Frank , even though covered by a cloud of suspicion , returned to his cottage in the garden of the Riddle House . 
In the Dead Poet , Dot said , 
" I saw that guy killed them , and I do not know what to say . 
And if he does not know a little bit , then he should not leave the country , because he must also understand that we do not know what he does not do . " 
But Frank did not want to leave . 
He stayed in the garden for another family to move to the Riddle House , and then to another family ... because no family lived in that house for a long time . 
Maybe part of Frank that new owners have said they have a nasty feeling about the house . 
And that house , since no one in it , began to decline , not to improve again . 
On these days , a wealthy man came to buy a house , not to stay or to use it for any other purpose . 
In the rumored village he kept the house " tax deduction , " although no one could explain it clearly . 
However , the landlord continued to hire Frank gardening . 
Frank was almost seventy - seven years old , very distracted , his limbs more than ever before , but he was still walking around the garden when the weather was good , even though the grass had begun to sprout . You have to try hard to beat them down . 
Grass is not the only thing that Frank has to fight against . 
The boys in the village still have the habit of throwing stones in the Riddle House . 
They rode their bicycles and ran through the grasslands Frank had been struggling to care for . 
Once or twice , they broke into the house to risk their lives . 
Knowing Frank was so devoted to the house and garden that the care of the house was almost a haunt for the young man , they were so pleased to see the limp boy cross the garden , screaming at the kids . 
As for Frank , he believed the boys tortured him because they , like their parents and grandparents , thought he was a murderer . 
So one night in August , Frank woke up and saw something very abnormal above the old house , and he thought that the boys had gone boldly one step further in the torture of the old man . 
It was the very leg that had awakened Frank . 
As old as age , the leg makes him more painful than ever . 
He woke up and limped down the stairs , into the kitchen , dangling a hot water bottle to cover the pain on his knees . standing by the sink , filling with warm water , he looked up at the Riddle House and saw the light flashing in the window upstairs . 
Frank knew what was going on . 
It was certain that the floods had broken into the house again , and based on the shimmer of light , they must have lit a fire . 
Frank did not have a telephone , but in any case he had not trusted the police since he had been arrested for questioning the deaths of the three Riddle . 
He placed the kettle on the table , hurried to his feet , and stumbled on the stairs quickly enough , and soon after , he returned to the kitchen , dressed in his clothes , he took the old rusty key . on the hook near the door , take the stick upright , and start walking in the night . 
The door of the Riddle House showed no signs of being ripped off , so were the windows . 
Frank tucked his arms around the back of the house , until he closed the closet . 
He took out the key , inserted the lock and opened the door quietly . 
He lived in a cave - like kitchen . 
For years , Frank had never stepped in . 
Even so , and although in the kitchen it was dark , he remembered where the door opened to where the corridor was , and he fumbled toward it , his nose inhaling with a musty odor , his ear dripping with any sound . Human voice and footsteps sounded above his head . 
When it came out to the corridor , it was slightly bright by the moonlight shining through the large window bars with two bars on the side of the main door , he began climbing the stairs , thank heaven for dust cover on top the stairs by the stone , because thanks to it the footsteps and the stick of the old sticks not so loudly . 
At the top of the stairs , Frank turned right , and realized where the intruders were gathering : at the end of the corridor there was a door to open , through the gap was a flickering flame Grab the golden light strip on the black floor . 
Old man Frank moved closer , clutching the stick . 
As far as the entrance was concerned , he could see a card inside the door . 
What he saw at that time was the fireplace that had been raised in the grate . 
I was so surprised . 
He stopped walking and listened attentively , because there was a man speaking in the room listening to a shy voice : 
Sir , the bottle is still a bit , if you still feel hungry . 
The second voice said : 
let's go again 
This voice is also a male voice , but there is a high - pitched dazzling glint , and cold as a chill wind suddenly blows through . 
There was something in that voice that left some of the scarred hair on Frank's scalp standing up . 
Worm , move us closer to the fireplace . 
Old Frank's right ear toward the door , his right ear heard temporarily . 
The sound of a bottle was placed on a hard surface , and then the creaking sound of a heavy chair was dragged on the floor . 
Frank glimpsed a small man with his back to the door , jumping the chair to the location next to the fireplace . 
The man was wearing a long black cloak , with a wolf on his head . 
Then he came out of Frank's view . 
The cold voice said , 
Where is Nagini ? 
The first voice heard anxiety anxiety : 
Sir , I do not know . 
I thought it was going to visit the house 
The second voice said : 
Worm tail , you have to milk it before we go to sleep . 
We need to nourish the night . 
The journey makes us tired . 
Frank bent both ends of his eyebrows firmly , with the other ear still sounding closer to the door , paying close attention . 
Quiet for a moment , then the man called the tail of the Screaming again : 
Sir , allow me to ask how long we will stay here ? 
The cold voice replies : 
A week . 
It may take longer . 
This place is quite comfortable , and the plan was not yet implemented . 
Acting before the Quidditch World Cup is over is stupid . 
Frank fingered his fingers to his ears . 
Probably because there was a nostril that somehow had heard , so he heard a strange word , meaningless : Quidditch . tail worm said : 
Sir , Quidditch World Cup season ? 
( Frank smiled his fingers more forcefully . ) 
Please forgive me , but I do not understand why we have to wait until the end of the World Cup Quidditch season ? 
Because , idiots , at this time witches around the world are pouring into this country , and all the squads in the Ministry of Magic are on guard , guarding every manifestation of any abnormal activity , checking to check back the identity . 
They will be haunted by security issues , so that the Muggles do not know anything . 
So we have to wait . 
Frank stopped trying to catch his ear . 
He heard the Ministry of Magic , the witch , and Muggle . 
Obviously , every word has a secret meaning , and Frank can only think of two types of people who use cryptography when talking to each other , spies and criminals . 
Frank grinned again , listening more carefully . 
tail worm small talk : 
Is he still determined ? 
In a cold voice there is now more threat : 
I'm still struggling , the worm's tail ! 
After this sentence there is a quiet moment . 
And then the worm's tail said , the cluttering clumsiness came as if he forced himself to say it before losing his courage : 
Is it possible to do that without Harry Potter ? 
Once again quiet , longer , then the second voice whispered in the breath : 
Free to Harry Potter ? 
I understand 
The tail of the worm grows up like a munched mouse : 
Sir , I say this is not because I'm worried about the boy ! 
That little boy is nothing to me , nothing ! 
It's just that if we use a witch other than any other witch , it will be paid much faster ! 
If you allow me to leave you for awhile , you know I can best camouflage myself . I can come back here in two days with a suitable person . 
Cold voice said softly : I can use another witch , that's right 
The voice of the worm's tail now sounds relieved : 
Sir , so wise . Touching Harry Potter will be very difficult , it is well protected 
And so you should volunteer to find us a life force ? 
I wonder if the work of refreshing me has made me bored , right ? 
The proposal to cancel your plan turns out to be just your attempt to abandon me , right ? 
Sir , I have no intention of leaving you , not at all 
liar ! 
The second shrieked . 
I always go clogs in the belly , tail Wren ! 
You are regretting that you have come back to me ! 
Do you hate me ? 
I see you cringe when you look at me , feel your shudder when you touch me 
Are not ! 
My devotion to your grace 
Your devotion to us is nothing but cowardice . 
If you have any other place to live , you will not find me . 
We need to nourish a few hours , no mi , how do we survive ? 
Who will milk Nagini ? 
But sir you look much healthier 
Lie ! 
The second voice whispered : 
I must be healthy , and leave me alone in a few days , I will exhaust the strength that I have gathered under my poor care today . 
Shut up ! 
The tail worm just stammered a few discrete words do not mean anything hastily shut up immediately . 
For a few seconds , Frank could hear nothing but the burning fire in the fireplace . 
Then the second man said , with a whisper that almost whistled : 
I have a reason to use a boy , as I explained to you , and I will not use anyone else . 
I have waited for thirteen years . 
Wait a few more months no problem . 
As for the fence surrounding the boy , we believe our plan will be effective . 
All we need now is just a little of my courage , tail Trunks ... 
You must find that courage , unless you want to get the full wrath of the Dark Lord Voldemort at the extreme level ... 
Worm's tail now becomes horrible : 
Your grace , let me say ! 
During our journey , I recaptured the plan in my head . Sir , the disappearance of Bertha Jorkin will soon be discovered , and if we continue , if I assassinate 
The second whispered : 
If 
What if ? 
If you follow the plan , the tail of Trun , the Ministry will never need to know who died . 
You will do it quietly , no little noise ; I only wish that I could do it myself , but in the situation where we are now the tail of Worm , here , just eliminate another obstacle is that the way we go to Harry Potter will be clear . 
I do not force you to act alone . At the appropriate time , my faithful servant will return to me 
The worm said wryly : 
I am your faithful servant . 
Worm tail , I need someone with a mind , someone with loyalty never move , but you risk instead , not meet both requirements . 
The tail of the worm said , now in his voice is a bit sour expression : 
I found you . 
I was the one who found you . 
I brought Bertha Jorkin to him . 
The second voice sounded pleasant : 
That's right . 
An unexpected intelligence that I do not think you can have . However , if you tell the truth , then you kidnap the baby , you do not know how useful she is ? 
I also think she can be helpful , sir 
liar ! 
The second voice exclaimed with greater evil pleasure than ever : 
But I do not deny that her information is valuable . 
Without it , we can not figure out this plan . 
So you will be rewarded , Worm tail . 
I will allow you to do a major job for me , a job that many of our disciples are willing to volunteer . 
Really , sir ? 
What work ? 
The voice of the worm's tail was full of fear . 
Well , Wormtail , do not you want me to spoil your surprise ? 
Your role is in the final stages , but with you , you will have the honor of being helpful , like Bertha Jorkin . 
The voice of the worm's tail suddenly became throbbing , as if his mouth suddenly drifted away : 
Will He kill me again ? 
The cold voice began to chirp : 
tails Worm , tail Worm , why should I kill you ? 
I killed Bertha because I needed to do so . 
After we interrogated her , she became utterly useless . 
Besides , if she returned to the Ministry with the news she had met on a summer vacation , she was asked to turn the silly trees again . 
The witches who were supposedly dead should not have bumped into the Ministry of Magical sorcerers at the roadside bars , you know ? 
Worm muttered something so small that Frank could not hear it , but that made the second man in the room laugh - a laugh that was completely tragic , as cold as the voice of y : 
Can we change her memory ? 
But the Melee Chou is likely to be broken by a high magician like you , as demonstrated by the fact that we interrogated her . Worm , if you do not use the information that we have exploited in her then it really hurt the memories of her . 
At the corridor , Frank suddenly noticed that his hand clenched the stick of his wet and slippery sweaty stick . 
Then the cold - spoken man killed a woman . 
He's talking about it without any remorse or regret - but it also looks good . 
He is dangerous - a madman . 
And he plans to kill more people . 
The Harry Potter boy , no matter who the boy is , is in danger 
Frank knew what he should do . 
Now , that's the time - if there is a good time to do so , it is now - go to the police . 
The old man would sneak out of the Riddle house and head straight to the public telephone station in the village , but the cold voice was heard , and Frank stood as if he were standing there , trying his hardest to hear . 
Add another name to kill my loyal servant at the Hogwarts tails School Worm , Harry Potter is very good as well as the same . 
That's what I decided . 
There will be no more arguments . 
But im thinking we hear Nagini's voice 
And the voice of the second man changed . 
He began to make sounds that Frank had never heard before . 
He whistled like a whistle and sputtered without breathing . 
Frank thought he was having a seizure . 
And then Frank heard behind him something moving in the dark corridor . 
He turned around and felt himself paralyzed by fear . 
Something was crawling toward him on the dark corridor , and as he slipped closer to the light of the furnace fire , he realized that it was a giant snake , the least of which three feet six . 
Terrified , dead , Frank glared at the wavy body of the serpent , sweeping a wide stripe through the thick dust on the floor , getting closer and closer to him . What should he do ? 
The only escape route is to run into the room where the two men are plotting murder , but if he stood up in place , then surely the snake would kill him . 
But before he decided what to do , the snake crawled up to his place , and unbelievably , the snake crawled , mysteriously strange . 
The snake crawled under the whistle of the cold - voiced man inside the door , and seconds later , the snake's diamond - shaped polygon disappeared behind the door . open 
Now , sweat swirled on Frank's forehead , and his hand was stiff . 
Inside the room , the cold voice continued to hiss and Frank flashed a strange idea , a thought that could not possibly be . The man could speak to Snake . 
Frank did not understand what was going on . What he wanted more than anything now was to return to his bed with a hot water bottle to apply his painful feet . 
The problem is the old man 
standing there shaking , trying to master myself , the cold voice that speaks the snake suddenly switch to English : 
The worm's tail , Nagini has some interesting news . 
The tail of Wormwood asks : Really , sir ? 
The cold voice replied : 
SQUARE , PLANTS . 
According to Nagini , there is a Muggle man standing right outside the door , listening to every word we say . 
Old Frank does not have the chance to hide anymore . 
Footsteps sounded , and then the door of the room burst open . 
A small man , balding , gray hair , pointed and small eyes , succulent eyes , standing in front of Frank , on his face confused fear . 
Invite him in this view , the tail of Trun . 
Your courtesy ? 
The cold voice resounded from the old armchair in front of the fireplace , but Frank could not see who was speaking . 
The snake , on the other hand , was curled up on a filthy mottled carpet that looked as if it were a parody of a pet dog . 
Wand gestures to Frank to enter the room . 
Although he was still trembling , Frank gripped the stick , limping across the door . 
The fireplace flame is the only light source in the room - throwing long shadows against the wall . 
Frank stared at the back of the couch ; The man who sat in that chair seemed smaller than his wormhunter , because Frank could not see his head , only a cold voice was heard . 
Hear all of this , Muggle ? 
What do you call me ? 
Frank said in a tone of voice , because he was endless in the room anyway , and now it was time to act , no matter what he did . 
I suddenly feel more courageous ; You always felt that way during the war . 
The voice of the man sitting in the armchair was cool : 
I call you a Muggle , meaning you are not a magus . 
Frank's tone grew more solid : 
I do not know what he said the wizard was about to say . 
I just understand that what I've heard tonight makes enough for the police to care . 
He killed and he is trying to kill more people ! 
And I must tell you this too 
His voice suddenly rose as he added : 
My wife knows I'm here , and if I do not come back 
The cold voice casually interrupted him : 
Mi does not have a wife . 
No one knows you here . 
You do not tell anyone to come here . 
Muggle , do not lie to the Dark Lord Voldemort , because you know He always knows 
Old Frank Rough : 
Is that right ? 
Lord ? 
Well , I do not take the polite way of doing things , sir . 
But why did not he turn to face me as a human ? 
But I'm not a human , Muggle . 
The cold voice sounded but it was hard to hear in the fire of fire : 
I am more than a human . 
But why not ? 
I will face the tail of Wormwood , come here turn the seat back to me . 
The servant moaned . 
Listen to me , Worm's tail ? 
With his countenance , the servant acted as if he would rather do anything than get close to his master and the mats under the burner where the serpent was . 
The little man stepped forward and turned the chair . 
The snake is full of ugly triangles and whistles gently as the chair legs extrude its rug . 
Then the chair was swiveled to face Frank . 
He saw what was sitting on the chair . 
The stick fell from his hand and fell to the floor . 
He opened his mouth , uttering a scream . 
He screamed so loud that he could not hear the spell , and the object sitting in the chair muttered as he raised his wand . 
A light of blue shone , a crash , and Frank collapsed on the floor . 
He died before his body touched the floor . 
Two hundred miles away , a kid named Harry Potter woke up . 
Chapter 2 Scar 
Harry was lying on his back , breathing hard as if he had just finished running . 
It has awakened from a vivid dream , with hands clasped face . 
The old scar on Harry's forehead , a scaly , lightning flash , was burning under his fingers , as if someone had just pressed a hot zinc . 
He sat up , a hand still on the scar , the other protruding with his glasses on the small table by the bed . 
He wore glasses and the bedroom appeared more clearly , thanks to the pale orange light of the street lamp outside the window shining dimly across the curtain . 
Harry rubs his fingers again on the scars . 
It still hurts . 
He turned on the light bulb next to him , crawled out of bed , opened his closet , and peeped into the mirror mounted inside the closet . 
A light fourteen - year - old boy was looking up at him , his bright blue eyes giving a pensive look under the messy black hair . 
Harry reconsidered the lightning scar in his mirror in the mirror . 
Looks the scar is still normal , but aching . 
Harry remembers what he had dreamed before he woke up . 
The dream seems so real .. ... In the dream there are two people that it knows and one person it does not know .. ... It is very focused , the eyebrows again , it tries to remember .. . 
The dim image of the dark room appeared in his mind ... There was a snake curled up on the carpet over the fireplace ... a small man named Peter , the Worm's alias . and a cold , loud voice ... Voldemort's voice . 
Harry felt like an ice cube just slipped down his stomach with the thought ... ... 
He closed his eyes and tried to remember how Voldemort's face was , but he could not remember .... It was only known that when the chair of Voldemort was rotated , it , Harry , saw what was sitting in that chair , it felt a frightening convulsion throughout the body , wake it up Is that the pain of the scar on his forehead ... ? To 
And who is that old man ? 
Because there is an old man ; Harry saw the old man fell to the floor . 
Things start to get confusing . 
Harry laid his face in his hands , letting his eyes see the bedroom , trying to remember the shape of the room setting the fire on the fire , but it was like trying to keep his hands on water ; The details kept leaking , so fast they did not catch up ... Voldemort and the tail were talking about someone they had killed , but Hary could not remember the name of that person ... and they is planning to kill another person ... kill him ! 
Hary lifted his face from his hands , opened his eyes wide , and stared at his bedroom to see if anything was wrong . 
Then there is the pile of things in the room in this room . 
A large wooden chest rested on its gioungwf leg , open to reveal a cauldron , a broom , black robes , and various magical books . 
The parcels of paper lay cluttered on its desk , encroaching on all that was not occupied by the huge cage cage . 
The empty cage was where Hedwig was often . On the floor of the room , beside the foot of the bed was a book opened , Harry reading the book that night fell asleep . The image in the book is moving . 
The men in orange robes were flying around when they were hiding in the broomstick , throwing a red ball to each other . 
Harry walked up to the book , picked it up , watched one of the witches make a spectacular table by pushing the ball through a ring on a sixteen meter high column . 
Then she closed the book again . 
Even Quidditch - the best sport in the world , according to Harry can not control his mind at this time . 
He placed the Fly With the Spirit on the bedside table , walked to the side of the window , pulled the screen to cover the path below . 
Privet Drive Street looks just like any respectable suburban neighborhood that is expected to be seen on the early morning of Saturday . 
All the windows are closed . 
Harry stared into the darkness , but no creature , no cat . 
But ... .. but .... 
Harry returned impatiently to his bed and sat down , putting a finger over the scar on his forehead rubbing again . 
It was not the pain that bothered him . 
One time it lost the bones of the right arm and had to undergo pain , nourishing those bones that grow back in one night . 
The same way that he was later banished by a terrible , poisonous fangs , three inches long . 
And last year , he had fallen from a broom at sixteen feet . 
He was familiar with the bizarre accident and injury letters . 
Those things can not be avoided if people study at Hogwarts - School of Magic and Magnetism - OBSERVATION OF THEIR HOSPITAL attracts a whole bunch of troubles . 
No , what makes Harry unhappy is that the last time the scar left him painful was , and that was the one time Voldemort came close to him ... ... But now Voldemort can not be near ... Voldemort idea is hidden náu đâu đây tren đongf Privet Drive listening to is ridiculous , no life .. 
Harry listened to the silence all around . 
Or is it drowsy waiting to hear the creaking on the stairs or the fluttering of the hood ? 
And he jumped up when he heard his cousin snoring in the throat of the next room . 
Harry jumped , thinking to himself , stupid . 
There was no one in the house except Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia and Dudley , and they were both asleep and their dreams were not disturbed nor painful . 
The habit of sleeping is the quality of the Dursly family that Harry is bestowed , unlike when they do not help it . 
Uncle Vernon , Aunt Petunia , and Dudley are Harry's only surviving relatives . 
They are Muggles , hated and despised by magic in any form . That means Harry is welcome in this family as a scammer . 
They explained how Harry's long absence from school at Hogwarts School for the past three years had meant that Harry had been taken to the St . Brutus Center for Unconstitutional Child Custody . 
They were fully aware that Harry , a minor witch , was not allowed to spend magic outside of Hogwarts , but they kept blaming Harry for any trouble in their home . 
Harry could never reveal or tell them anything about life in the wizarding world . 
The idea came to meet Dursleys aunt when they woke up , to tell them the scars made it painful and it worried about Voldemort , the idea that made Harry laugh . 
But it was because of Voldemort that Harry had to live with the Dursley family from the beginning . 
If not at Voldemort , Harry was not brought lightning scar on his forehead . 
If not at Voldemort , Harry still has parents ... 
Harry was only one year old the night the Voldemort was the mightiest witch for a century , and the witch has been in power for eleven years - the witch has arrived . Harry and the three of them and Harry's cheeks , he made a curse that destroyed many old witches on his way to gain his power .. And so incredibly amazing is the word That did not work for Harry . 
Instead of killing the baby , the curse has counterattacked Voldemort himself . 
Harry was unharmed , except for a small lightning scar left on his forehead ; And Voldemort is dying , only a pile of piles . 
His power dissipates , his life almost dying , Voldemort has gone . 
The horror that the secret society of the sorcerers have long been relieved , Voldemort's underlings were disturbed , and Harry Potter became famous . 
On Harry's eleventh birthday , he was amazed to discover that he was a witch . 
It is even more shocking to find out that everyone in the secular world of witch knows its name . 
Harry went to Hogwarts School and noticed that every head had to look at it and the whispers chased it no matter where it went . 
But now Harry is used to it . 
By the end of this summer it will begin in the fourth year of Hogwarts , and it has started counting down to the day it returns to the castle . 
But it was still half a month before the start of school . 
Harry looked around the room again in vain , and his eyes suddenly stopped on the birthday cards his two best friends sent to him at the end of July . 
Do not know what they would think if Harry had written a letter telling them about the scar causing it pain ? 
At once , Harry recalled Hermione's shrill , 
Your scar ? 
Harry , that is so serious that he wrote to Dumbledore ! 
And will go to look up the book The Pain and Ordinary Malfunction There is a card in which there is only how to do with the scars caused by the curse 
Oh , how Hermione would have advised him this way : go straight to the Hogwarts principal , and consult a book . 
Harry stared out the window into the dark blue ink color . 
It does not believe that a book can help it at this time . 
As far as he knew , it was the only creature to survive under a terrible curse like Voldemort's curse ; So it is unlikely that it will find the same symptoms listed in The 
Pain And General Punctuality . 
As for the presentation to the principal , Harry did not know where Dumbledore was going during the holiday . 
He entertained himself for a moment by picturing Dumbledore with a long , bearded silver beard , in a long sorceress wig , wearing a pointed sorcerer lying on some beach , rubbing Sunscreen on his long , curly nose . 
But no matter where Dumbledore was , Harry knew that Hedwig would be able to find him ; Harry's owl never fails to deliver a letter to anyone , even if the mail has no address . 
But what would Harry write in the letter ? 
Dear Professor Dumbledore , 
I apologize for harassing you , but your scar caused me pain this morning . 
Sincerely , 
Harry Potter 
Can you write like this ? 
But even when it was still in Harry's head , it was silly to say it . 
It turned out that Harry was thinking about the reaction of another of his best friends , Ron Weasley . 
So in a moment . Redhead , Ron's long nose and freckled face seemed to swim in front of Harry , bringing a great delight . 
Your scar ? 
But Who - knows - who - is - there's no place near you now , right ? ... 
I mean you would know if he came near you , right ? 
He tried to harm you again , right ? 
I do not know Harry , maybe the scars caused by the curse always sore a bit I would ask my father 
Mr. Weasley was a competent magician working for the Muggle Writer's Office at the Ministry of Magic , but , as Harry knew , he had no special expertise in matters of the sort . Like a curse Anyway , Harry did not like the idea that the Weasley family knew it , Harry Potter , just a little painful jumped up and down . 
Mrs. Weasley would hiss , more than Hermione ; and Fred and George , two of Ron's 16 year old twins , would have thought Harry was crazy . 
The Weasley family is the family Harry loves the most in this world . 
It is hoped that they will be able to invite them to their home in the future . ( Ron has mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup ) , and it does not want to have its visit haunted by anxiety questions about its scar . 
Harry rubbed the scar with the knuckles . what it really wants ( which it's almost embarrassing to confess to myself ) is that there is a person like , someone like a parent ; An adult witch can advise him that he does not feel stupid , a worrier cares for him , someone who has experience with Dark Arts 
Suddenly he thought of that person . 
It's so simple , and it's so clear that it's unbelievable that it takes so much time to figure it out . 
Could that person be any more than Sirius ? 
Harry leaped out of bed , hurried across the room , sitting in the desk . 
He pulled a piece of parchment toward him , the dot of his eagle's feather was in ink , wrote Dear Sirius , then stopped , wondering how to best describe his problem . It is still strange to think that Sirius did not think of it in the first place . 
But then , perhaps not so surprisingly , it was only discovered Sirius as his godfather two months ago . 
Even if it was not possible to live with him , it was Sirius who now Harry could put all his study supplies in his bedroom . 
Previously , the Dursleys were not allowed to do so . 
Their common wish is to make Harry as miserable as possible , plus Harry's fear of magical power has caused them to stow away their stubbornly stubbornly stubborn past in the summer . under the stairs . 
But their attitude has changed since they knew Harry had a godfather as a dangerous killer - because Harry had deliberately forgotten to tell the Dursleys that Sirius was innocent . 
Since returning to his house on Privet Drive , Harry has received two letters from Sirius . 
Both are taken , not by the way as in the world of witches , but by the large tropical birds of color . 
Hedwig does not accept those flashy guests ; She was very reluctant to let the tropical birds drank water in her tray before flying away . 
Harry , on the contrary , enjoyed them . 
These tropical birds bring to Harry's imagination the coconut groves and white sand that Harry hopes is where Sirius lives and is free . ( Sirius never says where he is , In case of stolen letters . 
For some reason , Harry found it hard to imagine that the Azkaban dementors could survive long in the bright sun ; Perhaps Sirius went south . 
Sirius's letters seemed cheerful ; They are now hidden under a removable floorboard under the bed of Harry . 
And in both letters , Sirius reminded him to call him whenever he needed to . 
Oh , now is the time it takes , okay 
Harry's light seemed to dim as the cold silver light of the dawn dawned slowly into the room . 
Finally , as the sun rises , as the walls in his bedroom are blazed with yellow , and the timepiece rises from the room of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia , Harry cleans scattered parchment on the table and reread the letter : 
Dear Sirius , 
Thank you for your recent letter . 
That bird is very scary ; It was so hard to get through the window into my room . 
Life here is still normal . 
Dursley's diet is not good at all . 
My aunt discovered it secretly put donuts in his bedroom yesterday . 
Aunts said they would have to cut their pocket money if it did so , so it made it very angry and threw its Play Station through the window . It's a kind of electronics that people can use to play games . 
Actually it is so stupid , now it's no longer the Super Smashing Electronic Program Part 3 to mesmerize the mind . 
I'm fine , it's mainly because the Dursleys are so scared that he can appear and turn them into a bat if he's a mare . 
But something strange happened this morning . 
Your scar is hurt again . 
The last time the scar was hurt was because of Voldemort Hogwarts . 
But I do not think he's near me right now , can not he ? 
According to my uncle , is the scar due to the curse painful for many years to come ? 
I will have Hedwig send this letter when it comes back ; now it is hunting 
Please send your greetings Buckbeak nhé . 
Harry 
Harry thought , yes , it was okay . 
Nothing to mention the dream . 
He did not want the letter to reveal it was too nervous . 
He folded the parchment and put it aside on the table , waiting for Hedwig to return . 
Then he stood up , stretched out , opened his closet again . 
No need to glare in his mirror , Harry began to wear clothes and go down the kitchen to eat breakfast . 
Chapter 3 The Invitation 
When Harry descended to the kitchen , three of the Dursleys were sitting around the table . 
Nobody looked up as he walked in and sat down . 
Uncle Vernon's face was red and white , hidden behind the morning news newspaper , and Aunt Petunia was cutting a pomelo , her lips clenching on teeth like horse teeth . 
Dursley seems to be sulking , and does not know where it seems to take more than usual . This is very meaningful , because often it alone takes up one side of the square table . 
Dursley's eyes were red as Aunt Petunia placed a quarter of the unsweetened grapefruit on her plate with a trembling voice : 
This part of me , Diddy dear ! 
Dursley's life has been a bumpy turn since it came to the summer home with a year - end academic report . 
As usual , Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia struggled to find excuses for its bad points : Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dursley was a genius child , only her teachers did not understand . 
Uncle Vernon insisted that whatever he did not want his son is a teacher learning rice . 
They also blamed the school for chastising Dursleys for bullying their friends . 
Aunt Petunia shed tears : 
It's just a boy who likes to be happy , but it does not hurt a fly ! 
At the end of the paper , however , there were some careful remarks by the school nurse that both Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could not explain . 
Regardless of the fact that its overweight is actually just a chubby dog , and that it's a growing baby that needs more food , the truth is the same : School uniforms can not be found in any large enough stock to fit in with the fat people . 
The school nurse saw what Aunt Petunia was ( aunt Petunia's eyes were on things like finding a fingerprint on her white walls , and in the tale of whoever went to her neighbor's house ) . It does not seem to matter that Dursley does not need any extra training , it's just about the size and weight of a whale . 
So , after so many brawls and scuffles , Harry's sleeping floor shook , and a lot of Aunt Petunia's tears poured out , a new diet was started . 
The pamphlet sent by the Smelting School nurse to the home was refrigerated . 
The fridge has now been cleared of the finest Dursleys such as carbonated soft drinks and pastries , chocolates and minced meat ; The fruit and veggies are filled with stuff that Uncle Vernon calls rabbit food . To cheer Dursley on the abstinence , Aunt Petunia asserted that the whole family was eating well . 
Now I'm giving Harry a quarter of a grapefruit . 
Harry noticed his pomelos 
Dursleys are sooooooo much . 
Aunt Petunia seemed to feel the best way to keep Dursley's spiraling was to assure him that it was at least as much a part of Harry's . 
But Aunt Petunia did not know anything about what was hidden under the floorboard underneath Harry's bed . 
I do not know that Harry does not force himself on a diet menu at all . 
At the beginning of the story , he would have survived the summer with a carrot , Harry sent Hedwig to save his friends and acquaintances , and they responded wonderfully . 
Hedwig returns home from Hermione's home with a large box full of sugar - free fries . ( Because Hermione's parents are dentists . ) Hagrid , who holds the Hogwarts school lock , expressed gratitude to Harry by sending him a bag of homemade ice cream . ( Harry did not dare to touch the bread , as it had so much experience with Hagrid's cooking . ) But Mrs. Weasley sent the family owl , Errol , to give Harry a fruit cake . giant meat pies and all kinds of meat . 
Poor for Errol , the old and feeble owl , need years to recover his health after the journey . 
And then Harry's birthday , ( which the Dursleys were completely oblivious to ) , Harry received four huge birthday cakes , delivered by Hermione , Ron , Hagrid and Sirius . 
Harry still kept two , so he closed his true heart when he returned to his bedroom , so he ate the pomelos without complaining . 
Uncle Vernon put the newspaper aside and snorted indignantly , then looked down at his fourth grapefruit . 
He grumbled to Aunt Petunia : 
How many are there ? 
Aunt Petunia looked at him gravely , then nodded to Dursley . 
He had eaten his grapefruit and was staring at Harry's part with a stingy eye in the pig's eyes . 
Uncle Vernon breathed a long , long , bewildered whisk of his bushy great mustache . 
Then he picked up the spoon . 
The door bell rang . 
Uncle Vernon hugged himself out of the chair and went down the corridor to the main door . 
As Aunt Petunia was busy with her teapot , Dursley was as lightning - fast as ever with the Uncle Vernon's grapefruit . 
Harry heard a voice at the door , then someone laughed , and Uncle Vernon's answer was dumb . 
Then the door closed , and there was a tear in the corridor . 
Aunt Petunia placed the teapot on the table and curiously looked around to see where Uncle Vernon had gone . 
You do not have to wait long to know ; Just a minute later , Uncle Vernon returned . 
Uncle Vernon angry anger . 
Out of Harry : 
You ! 
Traveler's room 
Right now ! 
Arrogant , it was thought to have done something wrong , Harry got up , followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen , across the living room next door . 
Uncle Vernon closed the door behind them . 
He walked to the fireplace and turned to face Harry , saying : 
So come on ! 
It sounded as if he was about to announce it was arrested . 
That's it . 
Harry earnestly wanted to ask : 
So what ? 
But he felt no temptation to test Vernon's anger in the morning , especially when the situation was stressed out by the lack of food . 
So he made a bewildered look . 
Uncle Vernon handed a purple handwriting in Harry's face : 
This one was sent here . 
A letter . 
About you . 
Harry was more confused . 
Who can write to Uncle Vernon about it ? 
Among those who know , who knows how to mail by mail ? 
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry , then looked down at the letter , and read aloud : 
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley , 
We have never been introduced to each other , as I'm sure you have listened to me . Harry said a lot about Ron , my son . 
As Harry probably told the grandparents , the World Cup Quidditch tournament would be held this evening , and my grandfather , Arthur , had turned the top tickets through a relationship . with the Witch Sports Department . 
I hope you and your grandparents will allow us to pick Harry up to watch the match , because this is truly a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity ; For thirty years now England have had the opportunity to host the World Cup , and tickets are hard to find . 
We are very happy to have Harry stay at our house until the summer , and will take him to the train back to school safely . 
Please reply as quickly as possible and it is good that Harry send us your usual response , because the Muggle mailer never delivered the mail to us , and I did not . He probably knows where our house is . 
Hope to meet you soon Harry . 
Sincerely , 
Molly Weasley . 
PS : I hope to put up enough stamps . 
Uncle Vernon finished , pocketed in front of his chest and hooked up something . 
Uncle growling : 
Watch this ! 
Uncle pointed out an envelope containing Mrs. Weasley's letter , and Harry had to hardly laugh . 
The envelope was stamped on , leaving only a small indentation on the front for Mrs. Weasley to record the address of the Dursleys in small print . 
Harry tried to say as if Mrs. Weasley was doing something wrong that anyone could have : 
So she put all that stamp ! 
Uncle Vernon's eyes flashed . 
He said through clenched teeth : 
The mailman's eyes were on . 
He certainly wanted to know where this letter came from . 
So he rang the bell . 
He seemed to think it was funny . 
Harry did not say anything . 
Others may not understand why Uncle Vernon was raging because of a stamped envelope , but Harry had lived with the Dursleys for too long to know how sensitive they were to any of them . What is unusual , even slightly different slightly normal . 
Their worst fear is that someone will discover they are involved ( albeit very far ) with people like Mrs. Weasley . 
Uncle Vernon still glared at Harry , while Harry kept trying to look his middle . 
If it does not do or say anything stupid , it can enjoy the opportunity once in a lifetime . 
He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something , but Uncle Vernon just stared at it . 
Harry decided to break the silence . 
She asked : 
So can you go ? 
A light contraction spread through the face of the purple cage of Uncle Vernon . 
Great whisper whirring . 
Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache : a fierce battle as two of Vernon's most basic instincts collided . 
Granting Harry would make Harry happy , something he'd tried to reverse over the past thirteen years . 
On the other hand , allowing Harry to disappear with the Weasley family until the end of the summer would get him out of the house two weeks earlier than expected , and Uncle Vernon would hate to have to hold it . Harry in the house of the uncle . 
It seemed to have more time to think , Uncle Vernon bent down to look at Mrs. Weasley's letter again . 
Uncle stare at the sign with disgust , then ask Harry : 
Who is this woman ? 
Harry said : 
Uncle met her . 
She was the cheek of her best friend , Ron , who met her at the Hog where the train brought her from school at the end of last school year . 
Harry almost says Hogwarts Express , and that certainly makes Uncle Vernon go crazy . 
No one was allowed to say the name of the school Harry studied in the Dursleys ' home . 
Uncle Vernon wrinkled his face as if trying to remember something very uncomfortable . 
Finally he growled : 
Is a dwarf with a whole bunch of red hair ? 
Harry frowned . 
It was unconcerned for Uncle Vernon to use a word to describe someone else , while his son , Dursley , had finally achieved what he had achieved since he was three ; From then on , the width of the plate . 
Uncle Vernon continued to study the letter . 
He spoke as lightly as breathing : 
Quidditch ! 
Quidditch what's the monkey ? 
Harry felt a nasty stab . 
It answers briefly : 
it's a sport . 
When playing , riding on the broom god 
That is enough ! OK ! 
Uncle Vernon shouted . 
Harry realized , quite contently , that his stepfather looked puzzled . 
Obviously , his nerves could not bear the sound of words like the broomstick in his living room . 
He nodded at Mrs. Weasley's letter again . 
Harry's lips curved a few hours : send the response of the grandparents to us in the usual way . 
He insisted : 
What do you mean by ' normal ' ? 
Yes , usually for us . 
Harry added and quickly added before the Uncle Vernon blocked his throat : 
You know , by the mailbox . That is the normal way of sending mail . 
Uncle Vernon froze as if Harry had uttered a vulgar swearing . 
Rushing up from the anger , the firefighter shot a strained look through the window , as if he was worried about having a neighbor on his window and listening to it . 
Uncle Vernon's face was now as purple as plumage , and she could not say : 
How many times have I told you not to mention unnatural things under my roof ? 
Watch that you're standing there , in the clothes that Petunia has worn on your ungrateful man 
After Dursley did not even bother . 
Harry continued coldly . 
And indeed , he was wearing a blouse so wide he had to fold his sleeves five times to use his hand . 
The lapel was long to the knees , covered with sweatpants outside the large crotch like a sack . 
Uncle Vernon trembled . 
You can not tell me in that voice ! 
But Harry could not take it anymore . It was a long time ago when it was forced to commit the most stupid rules in the Dursleys . 
He had not dined at Dursley , and would not let Uncle Vernon interrupt his visit to the Quidditch World Cup if he could . 
Harry took a deep breath and said , 
Well , I will not watch the World Cup . 
Can you go now ? 
I have a letter to Sirius that has not been written yet . 
You know it's my godmother . 
It did come . 
It said wonderful words . 
Now the violet color faded into the unmistakable face of Vernon , making his face look like ice cream mixed with black grapes , but mixed again . 
Uncle Vernon stammered in a calm tone of voice : 
Do you write to him ? 
Harry saw in the pupils of Uncle Vernon's faint - hearted eyes a sudden fear . 
Harry said as if it were a coincidence : 
Yes , yes . 
For a long time , he did not know how to live , he knew that , if he does not have any letters , he may think this is not good . 
Harry stopped to enjoy those words effectively . 
It was almost possible to see the larynx in Vernon's brain working under the thick black hair of his uncle . 
Unless Harry tries to stop Harry from writing to Sirius , Sirius will think Harry is being abused . 
If you tell Harry not to go to the Quidditch World Cup , it will write to Sirius , and he will know that Harry is being mistreated . 
So there was only one thing Vernon could do . 
Harry could see the conclusion that was forming in Uncle Vernon's mind as if his great mustache had a transparent , penetrating look inside . 
Harry tried to smile , keeping his face calm . 
And then 
Oh , that's fine . 
You can go see the stupid World Cup stuff that . 
You keep writing the Letters to the Weasleys to pick you up , but I do not have the time to get you around the village all around . 
And you stay with them for the summer . 
Do not forget to tell your godfather that you are leaving . 
Harry radiant face : 
Yes , yes . 
She turned back , walked to the living room door , tried to suppress herself so that she would not have to jump up and flip around for a few beats . 
It will be gone it will be going with the Weasley brothers , it will be going to watch the World Cup Quidditch finals ! 
Out to the corridor , he nearly crashed into the Dursleys . 
He was gloating over the door , apparently hoping to hear his three fans blow Harry for a match . 
Seeing Harry's grinning face , Dursley was almost shocked . 
Harry said : 
This morning's meal was great cat's eyebrows ? 
I feel so full , you no ? 
Smiling dumbly on Dursley's face , Harry jumped three steps up the stairs , then threw himself into his bedroom . 
The first thing he realized was that Hedwig was back . 
That owl was sitting in the cage , staring at Harry with amber eyes , and pinning the beak in a way that implied it was irritating something . 
Exactly what makes it irritated immediately . 
Ouch ! 
Harry whispered as a small , leather , gray tennis ball flew to one side of his head in pain . 
Harry rubbed the pain in an instant and looked up at what was new in his head , just in time to see a little chubby child that can grasp in the palm . 
The little prickly fluttered in the room like a strange fireworks . Then Harry realized that the owl had dropped a letter down at his feet . 
Harry leaned forward , recognizing Ron's expression , and ripped open the envelope . 
In the letter are scribbled letters : 
Harry - THREE TICKETS - Irish duel with Bulgaria , Monday night . 
She is writing to the Muggles to get her permission to come home . 
Maybe they have received the letter , I do not know how fast Muggle post office . 
Anyway , I think I'm going to send this letter with a pig . 
Harry looked up at the pig , and looked up at the little owl that was still flying around the light bulb on the ceiling . 
He has never seen anything less like a pig than a pig . 
Not so much Ron could read Harry . 
She returned to read the letter : 
Whether we like the Muggles or not , we can not miss a World Cup Quidditch match . 
Only three of them said that they should pretend to get permission first . 
If they say yes then send your answer immediately to the pig to bring back , and we will pick you up at 5 o ' clock on Sunday . 
If they say no , then you go back to the pig and we ' ll pick you up at 5 o ' clock on Sunday . 
Hermione will be here this afternoon . 
Percy started working for the Ministry of International Cooperation . 
Do not say anything to foreigners when you come here , unless you want to listen to the sermon . 
See you soon . 
Ron . 
The flew low and the trousers on Harry's head cried out the words Harry had glazed over as the proud word that it had delivered the letter to the recipient . 
Harry said : 
Yen ! 
Come here , I need you to bring back the letter . 
The puppies landed on Hedwig's cage , flapping their wings . 
Hedwig looked up coldly , as if challenging him to try to get closer a bit . 
Harry once again grabbed the eagle feather , with a brand new parchment , and wrote : 
Ron , the good run , the Muggles let go . 
See you at 5 pm tomorrow . 
Very intestinal fever , can not wait . 
Harry . 
Harry folded this letter very small , and very difficult to pin down the letter in the foot , because this child is jumping on the spot because of nervous . 
As soon as the letter is secured , the owl goes away . 
It swept out of the window and went off . 
Harry returned to Hedwig . 
He asked the owl : 
Do you want to make a long journey ? 
Hedwig chiseled a slightly self - honed owl . 
Harry picked up the letter on the table , saying : 
Can you bring this letter to Sirius ? 
Well , let me write some more lines . 
Harry opened the parchment paper and hurriedly added a few lines of the pen : 
If you want to get in touch with me , then maybe you ' ll be in your hometown , Ron , until the summer . 
Ron's father earned a ticket for us to watch the Quidditch World Cup ! 
The letter was over , and Harry tied the letter to Hedwig ; The owl stood unusually , as if determined to show Harry what a proper mailbox was , how to behave properly . 
Harry hedwig : 
When you come back I will go to Ron's house , okay ? 
The owl clears Harry's fingers intently , then , with a slight whistle , it spreads its large wings and rushes through the open window . 
Harry looked at the owl's shadow until it was out of sight . 
Harry crawled under the bed , removed the floorboard , pulled out a giant birthday cake . 
He sat on the dining room floor , savoring the happiness that was streaming over his body . 
She is eating cream cake , while Dursley is only eating grapefruit . 
It was a brilliant summer day , and it was going to leave the house on Privet Drive tomorrow , the scar on its forehead was now absolutely normal , and it was about to see the Quidditch World Cup . 
Right now it's hard to worry about anything - even about Voldemort . 
Chapter 4 Going Back to the Burrow Farm 
The next day , at twelve o ' clock , Harry's study chest was filled with all the school supplies and all its precious possessions , like the invisible cloak it had inherited . Her father , the lightning broom she received from Sirius , the spell map of Hogwarts that Fred and George had ceded to him in the previous school year . 
He had empty his secret food store beneath the floorboard under the bed , carefully examining every corner and gap in his bedroom so as not to miss a mantra or tree book . write the goose feathers , and at the same time take down the countdown plate to September one , which is used to cross out the remaining days , counting quickly to return to Hogwarts . 
The air inside the house 4 Privet Drive extreme stress . 
The fact that a bunch of monstrous witches were about to go to their house made the whole Dursley family anxious and irritable . 
Uncle Vernon was alert as soon as Harry informed him that the Weasley family would pick him up at 5 pm on Sunday . 
Not immediately grumble : 
I hope you tell them in advance to dress appropriately . 
I've seen how well the two of us are dressed up . 
They should know what to wear in the usual way is better . 
That's all . 
Harry has a faint hunch of a bad omen . 
He rarely saw him and Mrs. Weasley wear whatever clothes Uncle Vernon called ordinary . 
The Weasleys can wear Muggles on holidays and summer break , but Mrs Weasley is often dressed in long slacks with varying degrees of shabbyness . 
Harry did not mind what the Dursleys would think , but it was worrying , not knowing how the Dursleys might have treated the Weasley family with a bad image . the Muggles think of witches . 
Uncle Vernon was wearing the best of his valet . For some , this meant a warm welcome , but Harry knew that Uncle Vernon did so just to impress and be respectful . 
Dursley , on the other hand , looks somewhat contorted . 
It was not that dieting was effective , but because Dursleys were terrified . 
Dursley was afraid of the time when he met an adult sorcerer and was given a piggy tail tucked under his pants , and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had to bring it to the hospital , The surgery removed the tail . 
It was not surprising , of course , to see Dursley go out of his way to touch his butt , and sneak away from room to room , so that he would not have to show the old beer to the enemy . into the . 
Lunch is almost a quiet meal . 
Dursley did not even object to some dishes ( fatty cheese made with skimmed milk and puree plum ) . 
Aunt Petunia hardly ate anything . 
Aunt Petunia's arms folded , lips tightening , and it seemed as if she was chewing on her tongue , as if swallowing the angry curse that she just wanted to pour on Harry's head . 
Uncle Vernon shouted at the table : 
Did they drive the car ? 
Harry replied , 
Err 
He forgot to think about it . 
How did the Weasley family pick it up ? 
They have no car anymore ; Ever since the old Ford Anglia they owned , they have gone wild in the Forbidden Forest 
Hogwarts . 
But last year Mr. Weasley borrowed the Ministry of Magic's car ; Can you do that today too ? 
Harry said : 
I think by car . 
Uncle Vernon snarled behind his jaw . 
Normally , Uncle Vernon would ask Mr. Weasley what type of car he would drive ; They tend to judge people based on the car they drive and how big . 
But Harry doubted that if Mr. Weasley had driven a Ferrari car , it was unlikely Vernon would appreciate it . 
Near the end of that afternoon , Harry was in his bedroom . 
He could not stand the sight of Aunt Petunia gliding past the window of the curtain as if to hear that a rhinoceros was in the air . 
Finally , at five - fifteen , Harry went down the stairs , into the living room . 
Aunt Petunia was straightening up the pillows with a reluctant expression . 
Uncle Vernon read the newspaper , but his little eyes did not move , and Harry was sure he was actually trying his best to hear the sound of a car approaching . 
Dursley tried to fit his body into the couch , his icky naughty fingers sliding down , hugging his buttocks . 
Harry could not stand the tension : he left the room and went to sit on the steps of the corridor leading to the door , his eyes staring at the clock and his heart pounding with anxiety and anxiety . 
But five o ' clock ... 
Uncle Vernon , sweat in his suitcase , must open the main door , poke his head out to look at the road , then quickly indent . 
Uncle Harry : 
They are so late ! 
Harry said : 
I do not know . 
May ... 
Oh ... at the traffic jam ... or something . 
Five o ' clock ... five o ' clock fifteen 
Harry began to feel anxious now . 
At five - thirty , he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking nervously together in the living room : 
I do not know anyone . 
What if we had an appointment with someone else ? 
Maybe they thought they were late , we would invite them to have dinner ! 
Hmm , do not do that . 
Uncle Vernon said , Harry heard her step up and began walking in the living room : 
They will pick up the little boy and take away , there will be no goose goose here . That is to say they are there . 
They may be mistaken . 
You dare say people like them do not know the punctuality . 
Whether for that reason or because they drive a broken car . 
ÁAÁAAAAAAAAA ! 
Harry jumped up . 
From the other side of the guest room , the screams of the three Dursleys were frantically raging in one corner . 
In a flash , Dursley flew into the corridor with a look of terror on his face . 
Harry asked : 
What is this ? What's up ? 
But Dursley did not seem to be able to open his mouth to speak . 
His hands were still around the waist , it waddled away in the kitchen . 
Harry hurried into the living room . 
There , from the back of the fireplace was sealed with boards , which had only a few fake charcoals attached in front , the creaking and the screeching sound rang out unceasingly . 
Aunt Petunia leaned back against the wall , panicked , staring at the heated fireplace , panting : 
What is this ? What is it , Mr. Vernon ? 
But they were only confused for a few seconds . 
From inside the fireplace came a voice : 
Ouch ! 
Fred ! No , come back , come back , there's a mistake here ... do not George ... 
Oh ! 
George , no , there's no place , come back , and tell Ron ... 
Dad , maybe Harry could hear us ... maybe he could help us out ... 
There was a loud bang on the board behind the fire . 
Harry ! 
Harry , can you hear us ? 
The Dursley couple turned to Harry as if they were hunting wolves . 
Uncle Vernon growled : 
What is this ? What's going on ? 
Harry tried to squeeze a laugh like crazy to explain : 
They ... try to come here with Floo powder . 
They went by fire ... but the firefighters did not fire ... 
Harry went to the fireplace and called through the boards : 
Uncle Weasley ? 
Can you hear me ? 
The rumbling stopped . 
Someone inside the chimney said : 
Shit ! 
Uncle Weasley , I'm Harry ... the fireplace is already sealed , I can not go through it . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Damn it ! 
What's the matter with them that they clogged the fireplace again ? 
Harry explained : 
They have an electric fireplace . 
Mr Weasley's voice was excited : 
Really ? 
You say electricity ? 
Is there a power outlet ? 
Very nice , you must see that new ... to think ... 
Ah , Ron ! 
Now hear Ron's voice in the other people's voice : 
What do we do here ? What's wrong with the department ? 
Next to Fred , full of irony : 
Oh , nothing , Ron . This is exactly where we want to go . 
George's voice sounded chokingly muffled as if pressed against the wall : 
Oh , we are entering the miserable life . 
Mr. Weasley wondered , 
Well ... you're thinking of a way . 
Oh , yeah ... just one more way ... 
Harry , I stand back ! 
Harry pulled back from the long couch . 
But Uncle Vernon moved forward . 
Screaming at the fireplace : 
Wait a minute ! 
Exactly what are you going to do ? 
HAPPY ! 
The fire was so strong that it shot across the room as the fireplace closed , sending Mr. Weasley , Fred , George and Ron out with a cloud of debris and sawdust . 
Aunt Petunia screamed and fell off and fell on the coffee table . 
Uncle Vernon supported Aunt Petunia before she rolled to the floor , gasping for breath , glaring at her and saying no words to the Weasley father , whose hair was red , including Fred and George , the two are identical to the last . 
Mr. Weasley also panted , dusting off ashes from his green robe , and wore goggles : 
Better now ! 
Ah , my grandparents are your aunt's niece , Harry ? 
Mr. Weasley moved his lanky and wolfish body toward Uncle Vernon , his hand straightened , but Uncle Vernon stepped back , pulling Aunt Petunia . 
Uncle Vernon could not utter a word . 
The smallest of frosted clay covered with lime dust . 
Dust clinging to the hair and whiskers made the dad look like he was thirty years older . 
Mr. Weasley lowered his hand , looking back at the heater : 
... ... 
Seriously ... sorry about that incident . 
An error at me . 
So far I have never met this story in my head without the other end . 
Did you know , I connected your fireplace to Floo ... just one afternoon , so we could pick up Harry . 
Muggle fireplaces are not allowed to be online , seriously . 
But I had a good deal with the Floo Coordination Committee and they were connected to me . 
But do not worry too much , I ' ll settle that out in a flash . 
I will gather the flames to bring the children back , and then I will fix the fire for your brother before I expostulate . 
Harry is ready to fish , as Mrs Dursley does not know anything about what Mr. Weasley has said . 
They were still gaping at Mr Weasley , who was terrified of dying . 
Aunt Petunia was able to stand up but still hiding behind her husband . 
Mr. Weasley said cheerfully : 
Harry ! 
Hello , do you prepare a chest for ready ? 
Harry grinned , saying : 
Yes , to the floor that uncle . 
Fred said , 
Let's go get it . 
Fred and George leave the room after winking at Harry . 
They knew where Harry's room was , because they had freed Harry once at night . 
Harry wondered if Fred and George wanted to get a chance to look at Dursley . 
They've heard Harry say a lot about him . 
Mr. Weasley said , as his hands twisted slightly , trying to break the silence in the room : 
Wow ... the place of his grandparents here is very ... 
so ... 
a ... beautiful . 
Because the clean room was now scattered over by lime dust , this compliment was not well received by the Dursleys . 
Uncle Vernon's face once again turned purple , and she began to chew on her tongue . 
However , both seemed so scared that they could not speak . 
Mr. Weasley looked around . 
He loved everything about the Muggle people . 
Harry saw him eager to look at the television and the video player . 
He said with understanding : 
These things run on electricity , right ? 
Yeah , that's right . 
There are some plugs here . 
I collect power socket , his brother ... 
Mr. Weasley added to Uncle Vernon : 
And pin too . 
I have a great collection of batteries . 
My wife thought I was crazy , but the shelves . 
Uncle Vernon obviously thinks Mr. Weasley is crazy . 
The light bulge to the right , covering Aunt Petunia from Mr Weasley's gaze as if Mr Weasley could suddenly attack them . 
Dursley suddenly ran into the living room . 
Harry heard the chattering of his chest on the stairs , and it was probably the noise that made Dursley panic out of the kitchen . 
Dursley leaned against the wall , staring anxiously at Mr. Weasley , trying to yell to his parents to hide . 
Unfortunately , Vernon's butcher's body was not enough to cover Petunia , but could not cover Dursley . 
Mr. Weasley bravely initiates a conversation : 
Ah , this is my cousin , Harry ? 
Harry said : 
That's Dursley . 
Harry and Ron exchanged a quick look and avoided looking at each other , looking away , trying to stop laughing and want to die . 
Dursley also clasped his buttocks with his hands as if afraid of losing it . 
But Mr. Weasley did not seem to care deeply about Dursleys ' special behavior . 
Actually , based on the tone that Mr. Weasley had told Dursley , Harry was convinced he thought Dursley was crazy , just like the Dursleys thought about Mr. Weasley , but Mr. Weasley felt compassion for him . not fear . 
He asked me , 
Summer vacation , Dursley ? 
Dursley whimpered . 
Harry saw Dursley's hands squeeze closer to his crotch . 
Fred and George returned to the living room , carrying Harry's chest . 
As they entered the room , they rolled their eyes and saw Dursley . 
Their faces spread the same demonic smile . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Okay , let's go now . 
He rolled his sleeve up and pulled out the wand . 
Harry found the house leaning against the wall and forming a clump . 
Mr. Weasley pointed his wand at the hole in the wall behind him . 
The green flames flickered in the fireplace , cheering as if the fire had burned for hours . 
Mr. Weasley hooks a rope from his pocket , unbinds it , takes a pinch of powder out of his pocket , flames it , flames it up , and flames rise . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Fred , go ahead . 
Fred said , 
go now . Italy that ... forget ... 
A bag of candy fell out of Fred's shirt pocket and splashed on the floor , some delicious round candy wrapped in brilliant color paper rolling four directions to eight directions . 
Fred crawled around the floor , grabbed the candy in his pocket , and happily waved to the Dursley family , stepping forward , walking straight through the fire , shouting : 
Burrow Farm . 
Aunt Petunia gasped and jerked slightly . 
Just heard a scurry that Fred disappeared . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Now come George , you and the chest . 
Harry helped George carry the chest into the flames and set up the trunk to allow George to hold it firmly . 
Then a second whirring sounded , George had said the Burrowing Farm was gone . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Go to that , Ron . 
Ron said happily to the Dursleys : 
See you again . 
He grinned at Harry and walked into the fire , shouting : " The Burrowing Farm , then turn it down . " 
There are only Mr. Weasley and Harry left . 
Harry said : 
... ... 
Goodbye ... 
The Dursleys did not speak . 
Harry approached the flames , but it came to the edge of the fire that Mr. Weasley held out one hand to protect his back . 
Mr. Weasley looked at the Dursleys with astonishment : 
Harry said goodbye to his family , his grandparents did not hear ? 
Harry whispered to Mr. Weasley : 
No matter what , I do not mind . 
Mr. Weasley still did not let go of Harry's shoulder . 
He told Uncle Vernon indignantly : 
It was not until the following summer that he met his nephew . 
Surely he wanted to say goodbye to it ! 
Uncle Vernon's face twitched . 
Think that the Uncle is being lectured by a guy just blowing up half of his living room enough to make the bloody blood . 
But the wand was still in Mr. Weasley's hands , Uncle Vernon said , in a very impatient manner , after glancing at his wand through his wand : 
Oh ... bye . 
Harry set a blue flame foot , feeling as comfortable as breathing a warm breath . 
It says : 
See you again . 
But , at that moment , a vomit burst into Harry's back , and Aunt Petunia screamed horribly . 
Harry turned around . 
Dursley was no longer standing behind her cheeks . 
He was kneeling next to the coffee table , vomiting and spitting out a three - inch purple mucus from his mouth . 
After a moment's bewilderment , Harry realized that the three - inch thing was the Dursleys ' tongue . 
And on the floor , in front of Dursley was a colorful piece of paper used to pack the toffee . 
Aunt Petunia dashed down to Dursley , grasping the swollen tongue of his grin , trying to pull it out of her mouth ; It is not surprising that Dursley is even more lazy and spit - pounding than ever before , and the boy finds a way out of her mother's arms . 
Uncle Vernon 
screaming and scattering his arms , Mr. Weasley screaming loudly for everyone to hear : 
do not worry ! let me settle for ! 
He screamed as he raised his wand straight ahead and headed for Dursley , but Aunt Petunia screamed more dreadfully , then dashed to the Dursleys to shield it from Mr. Weasley's spell . 
Mr. Weasley said , 
Are not ! 
It's true ! 
Just a simple method ... just at the toffee ... my son Fred ... a monster joke ... just a swollen spell that vampire that ... 
At least , I think it ... 
Please allow me to explain ... 
But not only was she not safe , the whole Dursley family was more upset ; Aunt Petunia was crying like crazy , pulling Dursley's tongue out like she wanted to pull it off . 
Dursley seemed to be choked up by the pressure of both his cheeks and his tongue . 
Uncle Vernon , completely out of control , took a pot on the top of the locker and hit him with Weasley . 
Mr. Weasley shrugged his shoulders , causing the beautiful ornament to fall apart in the rubble of the previously broken fireplace . 
Mr. Weasley furiously waved his sickle wand : 
Listen ! 
Honestly ! 
I'm trying to help you guys ! 
Uncle Vernon screamed like a wounded hippopotamus , and his hand caught another decorative fountain . 
Mr. Weasley shouted : 
Harry ! 
Go away 
You go ahead ! 
His wand pointing at Uncle Vernon : 
I will solve this problem ! 
Harry did not want to miss the fun at all , but Uncle Vernon's second beautiful porcelain was just a few inches from the top of his head , fluttering over his left ear , and as he regained his balance , He thought it best to leave the situation to Mr Weasley . 
Harry walked in the fire , looked over at one and shouted at the Farmhouse ! 
The last scene of the living room slipped through Harry's eyes as he saw that Mr. Weasley wielded his third veneer bottle at his uncle's feet . 
Aunt Petunia roared and lay on the Dursleys to cover it , while Dursley's tongue swung around like a coyote sly . 
But right after that , Harry started to twirl rapidly , and the Dursleys living room swept past him in a jolt of fire . 
Chapter 5 The Witches of the Weasley 
Harry swiveled faster and faster , his elbows squeezed to the sides of the flanks , the dim furnaces flickering past , until it began to feel sick , to close his eyes . 
Then , when it finally felt like it was slowly flowing , it raised its hands and paused in time to prevent falling into the fireplace in the Weasley family's kitchen . 
Fred held up one hand to pull Harry up , asked suspiciously : 
Does it eat ? 
Harry straightened up : 
Yes . 
What is that ? 
Fred replied brightly : 
Gluten - free tongue - That's it . 
George invented it , which during the summer we did not find out who to test ... 
A laughingly falling head collapsed in a tiny kitchen . 
Harry looked around and saw Ron and George sitting next to a parched wooden table with two red hairs that had never before been seen before , though at first glance it knew who it was : it was Bill and Charlie . , the two oldest brothers of the Weasley family . 
The closer one of them said , 
How are you , Harry ? 
He smiled at Harry and held out a big hand . 
Harry caught the hand , feeling the lumps and blisters under his fingers . 
So this is Charlie , who works with Romanian dragons . 
Charlie's brother - in - law , like the twins , was shorter and stronger than Ron and Percy - long , sick and tall . 
Charlie has a large , well - rounded face , full of hallucinations , and many spots freckles so brown skin like tanned . 
Charlie's arms were full of muscles , and one of them had a blister . 
Bill stood up smiling and also shook Harry's hand . 
It can be said that Bill's appearance makes him surprised . 
Harry learns that Bill is working for Gringotts Bank and that he was the Junior Director at Hogwarts School ; Harry always fantasized about Bill as an older version of him . Percy : Fussy about breaking the rules and having fun with me all the time . 
However , Bill is very playable - there really is no other words to express for accuracy . 
He was tall , his long hair tied up like a ponytail . 
He wore an earring that looked like a fanged canine under his earlobe . 
The clothes Bill was wearing could not be lost at a Rock concert , except for one detail that Harry noticed he was wearing live dragon skin rather than ordinary leather . 
People were not able to see anything yet , and there was a sudden blast , and then Mr. Weasley suddenly appeared in the air , staring at George . 
He was getting a surge of hatred that Harry had never seen before . 
He shouted : 
That game too cool , Fred ? 
What is this muggle kid eating in the world ? 
Fred replied with a faint smile : What did not you give him something to eat ? I just dropped the candy it eat is its fault , do you ever tell it to eat ? 
Mr. Weasley roared : 
I deliberately failed ! 
You know that Muggle boy will eat , I know he's dieting 
George asked eagerly . 
And how big is its tongue ? 
Waiting for it to reach a size two and then his new baby cheeks to shrink . 
Harry and the Weasleys burst out laughing . 
Mr. Weasley shouted : 
That's not a laugh ! 
Playing that style would only ruin the relationship between witches and Muggles ! 
He spent half his life campaigning against Muggle abuse , but his own sons 
Fred said , 
You do not do it because it is Muggle ! 
George continued : 
No problem . 
We do that because it's a guy who's bullying others . right , Harry ? 
Harry warmly agrees : 
That's right , Mr. Weasley . 
Mr Weasley was still angry : 
That's not an excuse ! 
We ' ll wait for you , I ' ll tell you now ! 
Tell me what ? 
A voice was heard behind Mr. Weasley's back . 
Mrs. Weasley had just gone into the kitchen . 
She was a dark , chubby woman , with a good face , though her eyes narrowed in suspicion . 
Seeing Harry , Mrs. Weasley smiled : 
Ah , Harry , hello ! 
Her eyes immediately flicked to her husband : 
Arthur , tell me what , what's up ? 
Mr. Weasley was confused . 
Harry could tell with any certainty whether Mr. Weasley was angry with Fred and George , he did not really intend to talk to Mrs. Weasley about what had happened . 
While Mr. Weasley looked at his wife with concern , the room was quiet . 
Suddenly the kitchen door behind Mrs Weasley's back opened and the two girls appeared . 
A brown - haired girl and some big front teeth are Ron's best friend and Harry : Hermione Granger . 
The red - haired girl , the little one , is Ron's sister , Ginny . 
Both girls smiled at Harry . 
Harry smiled back at them , causing Ginny to blush . 
This girl was very adventurous and close with Harry since Harry had visited the former Burrow Farm . 
Mrs. Weasley repeated , with a slightly edgy tone : 
Arthur , tell me what , what's up ? 
Mr. Weasley grunted : 
It's nothing , Molly . 
Fred and George just finished scolding him 
Mrs. Weasley asked : 
What time do they do it again ? 
If anything happens to involve the Weasley Witchcraft 
Hermione stood in the doorway of the kitchen , saying : 
Did not you just let Harry know his bedroom , Ron ? 
Said Ron : 
He knows where to sleep . 
In his room , last year he slept there 
Hermione emphasized : 
So we all went away . 
Ron understands : 
Ờ Yes ! 
George said , 
Let's go with them . 
Mrs. Weasley : 
I'm still there . 
Harry and Ron tiptoed out of the kitchen , and they and Hermione and Ginny walked down the corridor to the rickety , winding stairs , clambering all over the house to the top floors . . 
When they were climbing upstairs , Harry asked , 
What is the Weasley Witchcraft ? 
Ron and Ginny both laughed , though Hermione was not smirking . 
When the cheeks were cleaning up Fred's room and George's , she picked up the order . 
The long list of prices lists what the two have invented . 
You know , the whole thing is stirring . wicked chopsticks , candy cake , whole pile of stuff . 
Outstanding excellent , I have never heard of this invention . 
Ginny added : 
The house often hear the explosion in the room of the photos , long ago , but no one is afraid of the invention . 
The house was thinking that some shots would explode . 
Said Ron : 
Only thing , most ... really all ... all that stuff is a bit dangerous . 
And you know what ? Two photos were intended to sell those things at Hogwarts School to earn a little bit of pocket money , making the cheeks crazy with some pictures . 
She said the two photos were not allowed to make any more of that kind , and she burned up three orders of two photos . 
No matter how badly the two of them are angry . 
The two images do not have much O . L . K . as expected . 
The Common Witch Certificate ( O . W . L ) is the type of certificate Hogwarts students must take at the age of fifteen . 
Ginny says : 
Finished and then again fussy : cheeks would like to work with three photos to work in the Ministry of Magic , which some say to the cheeks are photos just want to open a shop . 
At that moment a door at the top of the second floor staircase opened , and a hornet - shaped face protruded with an annoyance . 
Harry said : 
Hi Percy ! 
Percy said : 
Well , hi Harry ! 
Are you wondering who makes that noise ? 
You know , you are working - you have to complete a report to the department - and can not really concentrate when people run up and down the stairs . 
Angry Ron : 
We're not running around . 
We are going well . 
Sorry if we are bothered by the secret work of the Ministry of Magic . 
Harry asked : 
What are you doing ? 
Percy responded with a smug voice . 
A report to the Ministry of International Co - operation . 
We are standardizing the thickness of the cauldrons . 
Some cauldrons are too thin ... the leakage rate has increased to almost three percent a year ... 
Said Ron : 
That will change that world , I mean the report . 
Waiting on the front page of every Prophet Daily will run the big head on cauldron . 
Percy blushed slightly . 
He said impatiently : 
You make fun of me , Ron . 
But we will see that the market continues to overwhelm the severely scarce agricultural products , unless there is an international law applicable . 
Ron started climbing up the stairs , saying , 
Okay , okay , okay . 
Percy closed the door of his bedroom . 
When Harry , Hermione and Ginny followed Ron up the three stairs , the cheering from the kitchen hopped up to their ears . 
Mr. Weasley is reporting to Mrs. Weasley about some avocados . 
The room on the roof of the house where Ron sleeps resembles last year when Harry came here : still the Quidditch team's favorite Ron , the Chudley Cannons , the players are spinning and swirling . waving goodbye from the walls and low ceiling . 
The window curtain is still a fish pot , formerly containing tadpoles , now contains a very large clone . 
Ron's old mouse , the Scabbers , was no longer here , but instead of his position as an owl , the owl had mailed Ron to Harry at Privet Drive . 
He was dancing in a small cage and crying like crazy . 
Ron said : 
Shut up , Pig ! 
Ron squeezed through four beds in the room , saying to Harry , 
Fred and George are here with us , because Bill and Charlie take over their room . 
Percy's own room is reserved for his own photo because the photo must work . 
Harry asked Ron : 
Oh ... why are you owls pig ? 
Ginny says climbing : 
Because it's stupid . 
Its true name is Heo - Duck - heaven . 
Said Ron in a voice : 
Well , that exact name is not that stupid . 
Ginny named it that . 
Small children are so cute . 
I tried to change , but it was too late , that stupid owl did not even hear the name of any other name . 
So it's Pork . I have to keep it here , because it keeps bothering Errol and Hermes . 
And here it disturbs me ! 
The He - duck - the sky was circling its cage in a cheerful way , hugging its heels . 
Harry knew Ron so well that he did not pay attention to what Ron said . 
Ron groaned constantly at his old mouse , the Scabbers , but when Hermione's cat appeared and tried to eat the rat , Ron fumed . 
Harry asked Hermione now : 
Where's Crookshanks ? 
Hermione said : 
I guess it's running in the garden . 
He likes to chase ghosts very dusty . 
I do not see that many hours now . 
Harry sat down on one of the beds , watching the Chudley Cannons play as he was growing up on the promo posters on the ceiling . 
So Percy's job ? 
Ron said , 
The sea ? 
Have to say ! 
I do not think the picture home , if my father did not press the picture . 
The picture is married . 
Just do not start the image of the boss of the picture . 
As Crouch ... as I told Crouch ... Crouch agreed to ... Crouch told me ... 
They are about to announce the photo recruitment tomorrow . 
Hermione asked : 
Harry , are you happy holidays ? 
Are there any packages and everything we send ? 
Harry said : 
Yes , thank you very much . 
Those cakes saved my life . 
And you heard about ... 
Ron began to ask , holding on to Hermione's gaze . 
Harry knew Ron was about to ask about Sirius . 
Both Ron and Hermione attended a lot of things to help Sirius escape the Ministry of Magic and they also care about Harry's godfather as close as Harry's concern . 
However , it is not advisable to discuss Sirius in front of Ginny . 
No one knows how Sirius escaped or believed Sirius was innocent except Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Dumbledore . 
Seeing Ginny suspiciously looking at Ron to Harry , Hermione caught up with that embarrassing moment : 
I see the bottom of the house arguing . 
Or do we go down the side of your mother cook dinner ? 
Said Ron : 
Oh yes . 
The four of them left Ron's room and went downstairs to see Mrs. Weasley struggling alone in the kitchen , 
When the children came in , Mrs. Weasley said , 
We will eat in the garden , because there is not enough room for eleven people . 
Can not you bring your daughter to the plate ? 
Bill and Charlie were setting tables outside . 
She told Harry and Ron : 
Two children , then please remove the knife fork . 
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand over a pot of potatoes , a little stronger than her intentions , causing the potatoes to peel so quickly that they bounced into the walls and ceilings . 
Mrs. Weasley whipped her wand , now pointing at the junk , making it jump out of the closet and start slipping past the room , flipping through some potatoes . 
Those two ! 
Mrs. Weasley burst out in anger , and now she was pulling pots out of the cupboard , and Harry understood she was talking to Fred and George . 
I do not know what they are going to get out of it , it's impossible to know . 
No ambition , no striving ; Except for the total destruction of the galaxy is also considered as ambition to strive ... 
Mrs. Weasley put a pot down on the kitchen table and began to wiggle the wand inside the pot . 
She had just stirred a creamy sauce from the tip of her wand . 
She continued in a harsh tone : 
They are not stupid for cam . 
She put the pot on the stove and lit the fire with a wand . 
But they keep on furry . 
If they do not fix it soon , they will find it hard to see . 
I've received a lot of smiles from Hogwarts saying they were , more than all the other children's letters . 
If they keep doing this , then they will also have to go to the Department of misuse of magic for that . 
Mrs. Weasley swung her wand toward the drawer of the cutlery , causing it to pop out . 
Both Harry and Ron had to jump to the side when the flock of knives came out of the drawer , passed over the kitchen , and began to cut some potatoes . 
These bulbs have been trashed by the garbage . 
Mrs. Weasley put down her wand and began to pull out some more pots . 
She continued : 
I do not know that I have taught them the wrong place . 
How many years have they had any evidence , all the talk about this story to the other , but they say they cared ... REPEAT ! 
She picked up the wand on the table and it made a small noise and then turned into a great rubber mouse . 
Mrs. Weasley screamed : 
They are one of their dummy wands ! How many times have I told them not to leave these fake goods everywhere ? 
She took her true wand and turned around to see the pot on the stove stifling smoke . 
Ron held a fork in the drawer to open , talking to Harry : 
Come on , let's go outside with Bill and Charlie . 
We left Mrs. Weasley in the kitchen , behind the back door to the garden . 
They were only a few steps away , and the coughing and bristly cat crouched in Hermione's Crookshanks , hurrying from the garden , the broom - shaped tail of the broom blowing in the air . 
The cat is chasing something like a sticky potato with two legs . 
Harry recognized immediately that it was a ghost . 
The two - and - a - half inch high , the little feet were full of thorns , so they ran wildly as they crossed the garden and slammed down one of the wellington boots that rolled around the door . 
Harry could hear the croaking cry as Crookshanks cradled a clawed foot in his shoe , trying to catch the ghost . 
At the same time , a loud bang was heard from the other side of the house . 
The reason for that vibration was clear when Ron and Harry stepped into the garden . 
They both saw Bill and Charlie Charlie wandering the wand in their hands and were controlling two worn - out parapets above the lawn , each other fatally , trying to slip the other Medium . 
Fred and George were cheering , Ginny laughing and Hermione was huddled close to the hedge , obviously struggling between pleasure and anxiety . 
Bill's desk gave a chuckle at Charlie's desk and broke off its leg . 
There was a click above everyone's head , and all raised their heads up to see Percy's head poking out a window on the second floor . 
Percy screamed : 
Can you guys be quiet ? 
Bill grinned : 
Sorry to hear Percy . 
By the way , how many cauldrons ? 
That's bad . 
Percy responded , slamming the window shut . 
Bill and Charlie chuckled , mockingly looking at the desk , landed on the safe grass , scratching his head , and waving a wand lightly , where Bill was tied . put on the table , and change from the void of a tablecloth to the top . 
At seven o ' clock , the two tables screamed beneath the forks , one forked to the other - a great accomplishment for Mrs. Weasley . 
It was the Weasley men , Harry and Hermione , who were sitting around the table under a clear blue sky . For those who have been enjoying meals that are stale and moldy throughout the summer , this is a paradise , and at the beginning of the meal , Harry hears more than he speaks because it's so hot . Chicken pie with ham , boiled potatoes and salad . At the bottom of the table , Percy was telling Mr. Weasley the full report of the bottom of the cauldron . 
Percy said fervently : 
I told Mr Crouch that I would finish my report on Tuesday . 
That was a bit earlier than he had expected , but I wanted something that was the best . 
I think he will record me extremely busy , with all preparation for the World Quidditch Cup . 
We do not have any support from the Ministry of Sports and Magic as we need . 
Old Ludo Bagman 
Mr. Weasley interrupted peacefully : 
Ludo liked him very much . 
He was the one who took the tickets to watch the World Cup Quidditch so delicious . 
He also helped him : his brother , Otto , was stuck in trouble - he ran a supernatural lawn mower - he had smoothed everything up . 
Percy blurted out : 
Of course , Bagman is likable , but the way he got the head of the department was when he compared him to Crouch ! 
I have never seen Mr. Crouch lose one of his employees without finding out what happened to him . 
Did you notice that Bertha Jorkins has been missing for months ? 
Did you go back to Albania for a vacation ? 
Mr. Weasley answered gravely : 
Oh , he asked Ludo about it . 
He said that Bertha had gone missing a number of times before . 
However , you must also say that if someone in your department is missing , you will be worried 
Percy said : 
Oh , Bertha is out of date , so know . 
I have heard that she has been transferred from this set to customers for many years now , she was a bit more trouble that she did not deserve But anyway Bagman should also try to find her . 
Mr. Crouch also had a very personal interest , since Mrs. Bertha had been in the ministry for a while , knowing that , with the thought of Mr. Crouch being the only one . But it looks like Mr. Crouch just laughed , saying yes . Mrs Bertha misjudged the map and instead of going to Albania , she flew over to Australia . 
However 
Percy raised a sigh of emotion and took a sip of the flaming rice wine , saying , 
No need to go looking for other departmental staff , we have enough work done at the Ministry of International Co - operation . 
As you know , your ministry has another great event to be held immediately after the World Cup . 
Percy clears his throat with meaning and looks toward the end of the table , where Harry , Ron and Hermione are sitting . 
You know the person you're talking about , huh ? 
That dark person . 
Percy raised his voice a little . 
Ron rolled his eyes and whispered to Harry and Hermione : 
Photos are trying to provoke us to ask what the big event from the photo to work until now what event . 
May be a boom show - very thick . 
In the middle of the dinner table , Mrs. Weasley was pounding Bill over the ear ring . 
That seems to be a new one recently . 
with a huge fangs like this . 
Really , Bill , at the bank they say ? 
Bill patiently replied : 
Mama , at the bank no one is concerned about how the children eat , as long as you bring back the wealth . 
Mrs. Weasley still said , hands lovingly wand : 
And your hair , too , honey , looks like it's ridiculous . 
I wished you would let her cheeks be neat 
Ginny was sitting next to him . Bill suddenly flinched . 
I like your hair very much Bill . 
Mama considered a home then cheeks . 
Again , it does not compare to Dumbledore's bearded hair 
Next to Mrs. Weasley , Fred , George and Charlie chatted about the Quidditch World Cup , Charlie mouthed with mashed potatoes , saying : 
The Irishman will win . 
They crushed Peru in the semi - finals . 
Fred said , 
But Bulgaria have Viktor Krum . 
Krum is a great player , but Ireland has seven . 
I hope the team won . 
That's right . 
More than ever , Harry felt sorry for being isolated from the wizarding world during his time in a Privet Drive home , eagerly asking , 
What happened ? 
Charlie muttered , 
Down with Transylvania , three hundred and ninety and ten . 
Play all places say . 
And Wales lost to Uganda , the Scottish team was swallowed swiftly swallows . 
Harry was Gryffindor's Quidditch player from his first year at Hogwarts and now has one of the world's finest broomsticks , Lightning . 
In the wizarding world , flying is the most natural approach to Harry , compared to all the other things , and it plays in the Gryffindor team . 
Mr. Weasley allowed some candles to light the darkened garden before the home - made ice cream was served . 
When everyone had eaten , the moths had fluttered under the table , and the warm night was filled with the aroma of grass and cotton . 
Looking at the coyotes running through the rose bushes and laughing like mad when they were chased by Crookshanks , Harry felt so full and well healed . 
Ron carefully looked up at the table to make sure the house was busy talking , and then he spoke very little to Harry : 
So what did you hear recently from Sirius ? 
Hermione looked around , listening intently . 
Harry whispered : 
Yes , twice . 
He looks ok 
I wrote to him yesterday . 
He will probably respond during his stay here . 
Harry remembered the reason that he had to write to Sirius , and just a little to tell Ron and Hermione about the scar causing him pain , and about his dream of waking him up . He really does not want to make two of his friends nervous at the moment , especially when he himself is feeling so peaceful . 
Mrs. Weasley suddenly said while watching the wristwatch : 
Watch now . 
Now you must go to sleep , all the dawn of tomorrow are you have to wake up to go to the Cup . 
Harry , if you record the list of things you need for the next school year , I will go shopping for you in Alley tomorrow . 
You already have a list of the other boys . 
After the World Quidditch Cup , I will not have much time . 
Last World Cup lasted for five days ! 
Harry fervently : 
I hope this is the same . 
Mr. Percy said as he gestured for his diligence : 
I do not expect it . 
Think about the status of the mailbox after five days he was absent but shivered . 
Fred said , 
Oh , dare to have someone throw the dragon duckling again , Mr. Percy ? 
Percy flushed , saying : 
It's a fertilizer from Norway ! 
That is not aimed at anyone ! 
Fred moaned at Harry as they stood up from the table : 
Yes . 
This is how we are ! 
Chapter 6 Locking Ports 
Harry felt as if he had not yet fallen back on the bed in Ron's room and had not even had a nap before she was called up by Mrs. Weasley . 
She whispered to Harry and turned to Ron's bed : 
Harry , wake up baby , it's time to go . 
Harry wrapped his arms around his glasses . 
Outside is still dark . 
Ron muttered something that was not clear when his cheek rose . 
Harry saw the two mattresses at the end of his mattress head out of the pile of blankets . 
Fred was sleepy , asking : 
Are you up to now ? 
The boys dressed in silence because they were so sleepy that they did not want to speak . 
Then yawned and stretched out , the four of them went down the stairs to the kitchen . 
Mrs. Weasley was stirring something in a large pot on the stove , while Mr. Weasley was sitting by the desk , examining a large parchment - printed canvas . 
He looked up at the boys as they stepped into the room and stretched out their arms so they could see his clothes more closely . 
The dress he was wearing looked like a golf sweater and a pair of very old , slightly oversized pants for him , the pants clutched with a leather cord . 
He wondered : 
What do you see ? 
We should disguise that Harry , do you see me like a Muggle ? 
Said Harry , smiling : 
Yes , very much . 
George tried not to compress a jaw of his jaw : 
Where are Bill , Charlie and PP Percy ? 
Well , will they be invisible ? 
Mrs. Weasley picked up the big pot from the stove , put it on the table and began to cook the soup . 
So they may be lying on the bed for a while . 
Harry knew that the invisible shroud meant to disappear in one place and appear immediately elsewhere , but he had never heard of a Hogwarts student doing that , and he knew it was possible . extremely difficult . 
Fred grunted as he pulled the porridge toward him : 
So are some pictures still sleeping ? 
Why do not we land naked ? 
Mrs. Weasley : 
Because you are under age and have not passed the exam . 
Where are the girls ? 
She walked out of the kitchen and everyone heard her hastily step up the stairs . 
Harry asked : 
So I have to pass a new test to cover the territory ? 
Mr. Weasley carefully stuffed the back of the trousers into the back of the trousers , 
Yeah , that's right . 
Just yesterday the Ministry of Transport had to punish two people for landlessness without a permit . Describing it is not easy , and once done improperly , it can lead to lousy troubles . 
Two people that he said did not do right and have been banned . 
Except for Harry , everyone around the table shivered . 
Harry asked , 
What's wrong with you ? 
Mr. Weasley drew a spoon filled with molasses for his porridge : 
They left half their bodies behind , so naturally they got stuck . 
Can not retreat nor advance . 
Wait until the Disaster Recovery team comes to the rescue . So I was arrested and stuck in a bunch of messy procedures , can you tell me this , the Muggles that see a part of the body of someone is dropped somewhere ? 
Harry suddenly pictured a pair of legs and a rolling eye on the Privet Drive . 
She asked in amazement : 
Is that somebody ? 
Mr. Weasley confirms this as a tangible fact : 
Well , that's okay . 
But they will be severely punished , and he believes they will not be foolish to hurry again . Do not do descriptive jumbles . 
There are many magician wizards who have grown up but do not even bother to use it . 
They'd rather go with a slower brush , but it's safer . 
But can Bill , Charlie and Percy do all that ? 
Fred grinned . 
Charlie had to do it twice . 
At first the image fell , the image of land erosion five years to the south than where the image comes , appearing on the head of an old woman is shopping , remember ? 
Mrs. Weasley was walking into the kitchen with a cheerful smile . 
Yes , but the second time it's passed . 
George says : 
Percy passed the test two weeks ago . 
From that day until now , the photograph also littered down the stairs , just to show that the image is capable of burglary . 
There is footsteps in the corridor and Hermione and Ginny go into the kitchen , both pale and dull . 
Ginny sat down at the table and asked , 
Why do I have to get up early like this ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
We have to walk a bit . 
Surprised Harry : 
walking ? 
Are we walking to the World Cup venue ? 
Mr. Weasley smiled : 
no ! 
How many miles away from home ? 
We only need to walk a short distance . 
Just a bunch of sorcerers clutching it hard not to attract the attention of the Muggle . 
So we have to be very careful about how we travel and choose the most appropriate time , and especially in the event of a big event like the World Quidditch Cup 
George ! 
Mrs. Weasley shouted so loudly that they all shot up . 
George , in a naïve voice , did not fool anyone , asking : 
What ? 
What's in the bag ? 
no problem ? 
Do not lie to your mother . 
Mrs. Weasley pointed the wand in George's pocket and shouted , 
Accio ! ( meaning : come here ! ) 
Small , colorful things popped out of George's pocket , and he took his hand , but missed , and the little thing flew straight out of Mrs. Weasley's palm . 
Mrs. Weasley was terribly angry , holding on to something she could not possibly have mistaken for a tongue - in - cheek candy , shouting : 
I told you to destroy all this stuff ! 
They told me to throw them all away ! 
Get out of your pocket , hurry up , both of you ! 
Seriously is not a very nice scene cough . 
The twins apparently tried to take out as much Avian - tongue as possible ; and Mrs. Weasley had to resort to the New Summon to find all of them . 
She screamed : 
Accio ! Accio ! Accio ! 
The candy jams pop out from every corner of the hatch , including George's jacket and the hunting trousers of Fred's pants . 
When Mrs. Weasley threw the candy , Fred screamed at her : 
It took us six months to build something ! 
Mrs. Weasley shrieked . 
Six months to do this , or too ? 
What can not we get now ? 
After all , when people start to walk the air is not very friendly . 
Mrs. Weasley was still scowling as Mr. Weasley kissed her on the cheek , though that scowl was not as intense as when she looked at the twins . 
They put a backpack on their back and left without even telling her a word . 
Mrs. Weasley told the two dumb backs of the twins : 
Well , go play nice . 
And whether to behave properly . 
But the two boys did not reply nor turned around . 
When Mr. Weasley and Ginny , Harry , Ron and Hermione crossed the dark garden following Fred and George , Mrs. Weasley said to her husband , 
I would send Bill , Charlie , and Percy to come around at noon . 
It was cold and the moon was still hanging in the sky . 
Only a faint blue color on the right side of the horizon is the dawn signal is gradually shining . 
Harry envisioned thousands of witches hurrying toward the Quidditch World Cup , which also bustled with Mr. Weasley . 
She asked : 
Then how did everyone get to the game without the Muggle ? 
Mr. Weasley sighed : 
That is a great organizational issue . 
The trouble is , hundreds of thousands of witches are heading for the World Quidditch Cup , while we of course have no magical place to hold everyone . 
There are places where Muggles can not penetrate or see , but try to imagine the scene of cramming hundreds of thousands of witches into Algonquin or the Nine - Fours . 
So we have to find a field full of deserted , then to cast as many charms to fight Muggle as possible . 
The Ministry has been working for months . 
Of course , first of all we have to arrange to get to the stadium . 
Cheap ticket holders must arrive two weeks early . 
A few are by Muggle buses , but we can not fill their bus or tram . 
You should remember that witches from around the world came here ! 
Of course , some of us are territorial , but we must also set up safe places for them to appear , far from the Muggle . 
I believe there is a nearby forest nearby that is used for expanse . For those who do not want to be buried , or can not be buried , as we do , we can use the port lock . These are objects that help us move from one location to another at a predetermined time . 
If necessary , we can go to a large group of people for a while . 
Up to two hundred locks are strategically located throughout England , and the closest one is at the top of Stoatshead . that's where we're going . 
Mr. Weasley pointed forward , over there , across the village of Ottery St Catchpole , offering a huge black mass . 
Harry asked curiously : 
What is the port lock ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Well , it could be anything . 
Of course , it must be discreet , so that the Muggle people do not mistake them for picking up pieces that they just treat as garbage . 
Everyone was slow on the damp countryside toward the village , only their footsteps broke the silence . 
The sky slowly shines as they pass through the village , the darker ink - like color that is gradually becoming blue . 
Harry's legs were cold . 
Mr. Weasley is watching the clock . 
They did not have much strength to talk to when they started climbing Stoatshead , occasionally stumbling through rabbit holes hidden in grass bushes , or slipping on black soil . 
Every breath of Harry inhaled as it closed his chest , and finally , when he reached his feet on the ground , his legs began to stiffen . 
Mr. Weasley removed the glass and wiped his sweat , panting : 
Wow ! 
We finally have ten minutes 
Hermione was the last man to reach the top of the hill , her hands clutching one side of her hips in shock . 
Mr. Weasley put on his glasses , glanced around the ground . 
He said : 
Now we just need to find the port locks . 
It's not that big 
They spread out , looking . 
However , they only had to search for two minutes , then a loud shout in the silent space : 
Here , Arthur ! 
Come here , we have earned . 
Two tall figures in the shadow of the sky still glittering stars on the other side of the hill . 
Mr Weasley smiled striding toward the screaming man . 
Mr. Weasley greeted : 
Amos ! 
The children followed Mr. Weasley . 
The man shakes hands with Mr. Weasley is a rosy - faced wizard and a mustache brown . 
He was holding an old pipe shoe that was moldy . 
Mr. Weasley introduced : 
Dear , this is Uncle Amos Diggory . 
He worked at the Ministry of Regulation and Control of Mysterious Creatures . 
And you mean you know Cedric , his son ? 
Cedric Diggory is an extremely handsome seventeen - year - old boy . 
He is the captain and the player of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team at Hogwarts . 
Cerdic Diggory looked around , saying : 
Hello ! 
Everyone greeted , except for Fred and George . 
These two just nodded . 
They would never forgive Cerdic for the crime of defeating their home team , Gryffindor , in their first match last year . 
Mr. Diggory asked : 
go away , Arthur ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Not too bad . 
We live just across the village . 
And you ? 
We have to get up at two o ' clock , right , Cerdic ? 
I say to you , when it's a grandchildren , I'm happy . 
And now should not complain about the World Cup Quidditch , although a bag full of Galleon gold can not be missed . 
The ticket is almost as close . 
Sorry , I seem to be a little bit curious 
Mr. Diggory looked at the three Weasleys , Harry , Hermione and Ginny with a kind glance : 
Are all your children , Arthur ? 
Oh no ! 
Only some red heads . 
Mr. Weasley pointed at the children , introducing : 
This is Hermione , Ron's friend , and this is Harry , another friend 
His eyes open large Diggory : 
Dear mom ! 
Harry ? 
Harry Potter right ? 
Harry replied , 
Oh yes . 
Harry was accustomed to being curious when people met him , accustomed to the way they immediately looked for the lightning scar on his forehead , but even so it made him feel uncomfortable . roof . 
Mr Diggory said : 
Of course Cerdic had talked about me , telling us all about the Quidditch match that he had played with him last year . I told him I said Cerdic , that's what I would tell my grandson later . Your grandson , that's worth telling . I've beaten Harry Potter ! 
Harry could not think of anything to respond to , so he stood silent . 
Fred and George again rage again . 
Cerdic looked a bit confused . 
She said to her father : 
Harry fell out of his goddamn tree , Daddy . 
I told you it was an accident 
Mr. Diggory pat on the back of his son , roared in a cordial way : 
right . 
But you do not fall off the broom , right ? 
Our son , Cerdic , is always humble , always a good man , but the winner is the best , I'm sure Harry will say that too , right ? 
One who falls from the broom , one who stays on the broom , does not need to be a genius to say who is better off ! 
Mr. Weasley looked at the clock and said quickly : 
Yes , it's coming . 
Amos , do you know if we have to wait any longer ? 
Mr Diggory said : 
No , the Lovegood family came there a week ago , and the Fawcett family did not get tickets . 
In this area are not many people like us ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
No , as far as I know . 
Yes , there is only one more minute . We should be ready 
He looked at Hermione and Harry : 
You only need to touch Lockport , just that , touch a finger as well 
Wearing a heavy backpack on his back , it was also difficult for the nine to slip around in an old shoe at Diggory's hand . 
They all stood there , in a tight circle , a breeze blowing through the hilltop . 
No one said anything . 
Harry suddenly thought this was a monstrous scene as long as one Muggle accidentally climbed to the top of the hill at this time . Nine people , including two adults , clung to the old shoe in the picture . Twilight , and wait 
Mr. Weasley watched the watch , murmuring : 
Three Two One 
And it happened right away : Harry felt as if there was a hook in the navel that suddenly jerked forward without any resistance . 
Its feet are out of the ground ; It felt Ron and Hermione were on either side of him , their shoulders touching his shoulders ; All of them jumped forward very quickly in the winds of wind and color twisting . 
Yorkins ' forearms are trapped in the shoe as if the shoe is pulling it forward with magnetism , and then 
Harry's feet touching the ground ; Ron collapsed on it , causing it to fall to the ground . 
The key of the port fell to the ground with a heavy blade next to it . 
Harry looked up . 
Mr. Weasley , Diggory and Cerdic stood firm , though it looked like it was windy . 
Everybody else landed on the ground . 
A voice rang out : 
The five o ' clock o ' clock came from Stoatshead Hill . 
Chapter 7 Bagman and Crouch 
Harry pushed Ron out and tried to stand up . 
They came to a place that seemed like a sprawling deserted and empty field . 
In front of them are two witches who look cranky and exhausted . 
One of the two men held a large gold watch and the other held a thick roll of leather and a goose feather . 
Both witches were dressed as Muggles , but they were dressed up to say the least : dressed in a frock , wearing rubber boots high up to the thighs ; The other man was dressed in a Scotch dress and covered with a pout . 
Mr. Weasley picked up the shoe , gave it to the witch wearing a skirt , said , 
Dear Mr. Basil . 
Basil tossed his shoe in a big box full of used portals and put it next to him . 
Harry could see an old newspaper , a hollow cans of water and a hole in his skin . 
Basil responded with a warm welcome to Weasley : 
Hello Arthur ! 
Not right ? 
Some people are so happy that I have to stay here all night . I should avoid the way out , we are going to have a very large group coming from the Black Forest at five fifteen . 
Wait , I ' ll make camp for Mr. Weasley Weasley 
He looked at the list in the parchment : 
Walk about a quarter of a mile to the other , the yard that you will come to first . 
He manages a camping site called Roberts . 
And Mr. Diggory about the second yard . Ask Mr. Payne . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Thank you Basil . 
Then he told the children to follow him . 
They walked across the empty moors , unable to tell what was going on in the blind . 
After about twenty minutes , a tiny stone hut next to a gate appeared . Behind that gate , Harry could only guess the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents growing up on the sloping slopes of a vast expanse of woods down a dark forest on the horizon . 
The Weasley farewells to Diggory's father and approaches the stone hut . 
A man stood in the threshold , looking out over the tents . 
At a glance , Harry realized that this was the only Muggle in the wide area around him . 
At the footsteps , the Muggles turned their heads to see the Weasley League . 
Mr. Weasley said cheerfully : 
Hello ! 
The Muggles said : 
Hello ! 
Are you Mr. Roberts ? 
Oh , right . 
Who are you ? 
Weasley Two tents two days ago . 
Mr. Roberts probed the list on the door : 
Here , your place is above the forest . 
Just one night ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
right . 
Mr. Roberts said : 
Do you pay now ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Oh yes , of course 
Mr. Weasley stepped back from the hut a short distance and shook Harry toward him : 
Help me , Harry . 
Mr. Weasley whispered and pulled out a Muggle money from his coat pocket and started removing each of the banknotes . 
Is this sheet ten sheets ? Oh right , now you see the tiny number on the paper then this is the five ? 
The two dozen . 
Harry corrected himself with a faint voice , conscious uncomfortably that Roberts was trying to listen to every word . 
Oh , yes , the twenty dozen papers do not know , these three paper money 
When Mr. Weasley returned with the same amount , Mr. Roberts asked : 
Foreigner 
Mr. Weasley did not understand , asking again : 
Foreigner ? 
Mr. Roberts carefully studied Mr. Weasley : 
He was not the first person to use the money . 
Ten minutes ago I met two people who paid me big gold coins with a wheel cover . 
Mr. Weasley asked anxiously : 
Really ? 
Mr. Roberts rummaged in a tin can of silver to get the money back . 
Suddenly he looked at the misty field , suddenly said : 
Never seen so crowded . 
Hundreds of bookkeepers . 
Often , people just arrive 
Really ? 
Mr. Weasley held out his hand to get the money back , but Roberts refused to take it . 
He said with a thought of his mind : 
Wow . 
People from all over . 
Heap foreigners . 
And not just foreigners . 
You know , weird guys . 
There was a guy busy dressing Pong - buckets to root roots around here too . 
Mr. Weasley asked anxiously : 
Should not I wear that ? 
Mr. Roberts said : 
It's like there's something I do not know like a kind of force gathering . 
They seem to know each other . 
It's like a big party . 
At that moment , a mage dressed up in the air appeared at the front door of Mr. Roberts ' house . 
He pointed his wand at Roberts , in short : 
Obliviate ! ( Meaning : forget it ! ) 
Immediately , Roberts ' eyes lost focus , his eyebrows stretching , not flinched , a blank look blankly covering his face . 
Harry recognizes the symptoms of a person who has just changed memory . 
Roberts calmly told Mr. Weasley : 
A campsite map for you . 
And this is your turn . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Thank you very much . 
The wizard who wore the Weasley suit arrived at the gate of the campsite . 
He looked as exhausted , his chin indigo blue because the bearded feet are not edible shave , his eyes are deep and dark . 
When he had gone so far that Roberts could not hear his ear , he wore a trench coat with Mr. Weasley : 
There was a lot of trouble with that guy . 
Every day , it takes ten times to spit out to make the boy happy . 
And Ludo Bagman did not help . 
Just ride the horses around and then raise their voices on Bludger balls with Quaffle , without the slightest worry about Muggle security . 
Parents , this is the end that I will know how long . 
See you later Arthur . 
Then he landed invisible . 
Ginny was surprised : 
I thought Mr. Bagman was the head of the Department of Sports Witch ! 
He should have been more aware of Bludger talking to Muggles , right ? 
Mr. Weasley smiled , saying : 
right ? 
He led them through the gate to the campsite . 
Mr Ludo is always slightly concerned about security issues . 
But one can not expect a more enthusiastic athlete than him . 
You know , the youngster he played in the England Quidditch team , and he is the best player ever to win the Wimbourne Corn Wings . 
The crowd fumbled through the empty fields of smoke smudged between two rows of tents . 
Most of the tents look so ordinary , the owner of the tents is obviously trying their best to make themselves look like the Muggles , but then pulls out the witch's tail again when the knot is added , Which is the wind chimes , which is the bell wire . There was a sorcerer's tent so obvious that Harry was suspicious was not surprising . 
The hollowed - out space was a tent made of stripe silk , filled with glittering ornaments , looked like a tiny castle , filled with feathers on the entrance . 
A little further , the Weasleys came across a three - storeyed tent , with towers , including a decorative cotton garden , a bird bath , and even a spray lake . water again . 
Mr. Weasley smiled : 
Always that . 
When the witch we gather , it is difficult to resist the breeze . 
Well , here , look , this is our place ! 
They reached the edge of the forest on the highest point of the field . 
The place was empty , there was a tiny sea on the ground that was WEEZLY ( They wrote the wrong Weasley house ) . 
Mr. Weasley was very happy . 
There can be no better place . 
The stage is just across the forest , as if you are closest . 
He threw his backpack on , saying excitedly : 
Listen , do not use magic , seriously speaking , absolutely not used magic when we gather like this in the Muggle land . 
We will set up these tents by hand ! 
No matter how hard the Muggle people do , Harry , where do you think we should start ? 
Harry had never been camping in his life ; The Dursleys never took it on any holidays or holidays , only sending it to an old neighbor named Figg who watched as they were away . 
However , it and Hermione also made the most of the piles and hooks , and even though Mr. Weasley was only tearing up the job , he did not have a clue whatsoever when he used a mallet . Completely over excited , the whole crowd managed to build two tents twisting xuzch . 
All of them stood back and admired the work with their hands . 
Harry thought no one could see the tents , but the trouble was that when Bill , Charlie , and Percy arrived , their group would be ten . 
It seems Hermione also sees this problem . 
She gave Harry a puzzled look as Mr. Weasley sat down on the ground and used both hands and feet to crawl in the first tent . 
From there , he called out : 
We will be a bit tight , but you think we can be good at warming up . 
See you here . 
Harry crouched down , tucked through the canvas door to the inside , and his mouth gaped openly : it had just entered a place that looked like a three - room , antique - style apartment full of baths and kitchens . . 
And strangely enough , the room was decorated and decorated in the same way as Mrs. Figg's house : there were sheets knit over the stools that did not eat well with each other and a cat smell . very strong . 
Mr. Weasley used a handkerchief to clean his bald head , just poking his head in the bedroom with four bunk beds . 
Three of these borrowed from the Perkin family together in the department . 
Now do not go camping , poor , he has back pain . 
He picked up a kettle , looking inside : 
Well , we need some water 
Ron followed Harry into the tent and there seemed to be no impression at all about the unusual inside of the tent . 
It says : 
There was a tap marked in the map Muggle gave him . 
It was on the other side of the pitch . 
Mr. Weasley handed the kettle and the pots to Ron : 
Then you , Harry and Hermione went and got some water with some pots ? 
The other three will gather firewood to the kitchen . 
Said Ron : 
But I have a stove , why not ? 
Mr Weasley's face lit up with anticipation . : 
Ron , that violates the anti - Muggle security regulations . 
When the Muggles went camping , they set fire to a place outside for cooking . 
You see them doing that . After a quick glance at the girl's tent , slightly smaller than the boy's tent , and without the smell of a cat , Harry , Ron and Hermione held the kettle and the crucible across the court . 
Now that the sun has sprung up , the fog has dissipated , and they can see a whole tent city reaching out in all directions . 
They walked slowly through the rows of tents , eagerly looking back and forth . 
Harry had a glimpse of how many witches and wizards there were in this world ; Indeed , it has never neglected the thought of witches and wizards in other countries . 
The campers with them began to wake up . 
First of all , families with children ; Harry had never seen those witches and wizards before . 
A boy under the age of two gripping a wand and hugging a snail in the grass , the snail slowly bulging into an Italian sausage . 
When they went to the boy's place , his cheeks rushed out of the tent : 
How many times , Kevin ? 
I - not - be - touched - no - tree - wand - spade - of - three . 
Are you listening ? 
She stomped on the huge snail and made it ball . 
Her scolding is still chasing after them and in the cry of the witch child : 
The cheeks crack the snail ! 
The cheeks crack the snail ! 
A short distance away , they saw two other little witches , just a little more than Kevin , riding a toy broom , the toy broom just flying high enough to finger our toes . The fly is the grass . 
A sorcerer from the Ministry of Magic discovered the kids right away , and he rushed past Harry's face , Ron and Hermione muttering like a dementor : 
In the middle of the day ! 
Three cheeks they are sleeping baking star not 
Scattered here the witches and mages are coming out of the tents and start preparing breakfast . 
Some put their sneaky eyes around , then wiped a fire with their wand ; Some people matched with suspicion , as if they knew how to match these matches to fire ! 
The three African witches were sitting in serious talks , all three wearing white robes and grilling something like a rabbit on a purple flame , while a group of middle - aged American sorcerers sat chatting happily under a gilded banner stretched between two of their tents : SALEM FACILITIES . 
Harry listened to the strange language coming from within the tents they were passing through , and though he did not understand a single word , he still felt the excitement in every voice . 
Said Ron : 
Do not know what your eyes are doing , or is everything blue suddenly all the way ? 
Not at all Ron's eyes . 
They were passing through a tent covered with thickly mesmerized leaves , which looked like the weird hills that just bounced from the ground . 
Beneath that thick green grass , they could see the grinning faces as they opened the tent door . 
Then suddenly , there was a voice calling out their name from behind : 
Harry ! 
Ron ! 
Hermione ! It was Seamus Finnigan , a fourth - year classmate with them at Gryffindor's Hogwarts . 
He was sitting in front of his own tent , covered with grass , and next to it was a woman with sandy hair , no other than her cheek . 
And his best friend in Gryffindor is also sitting next to him : Dean Thomas . 
Seamus grinned , 
Do you like this decoration ? The Ministry of Magic is not happy at all ! 
Ms Finnigan said : 
But why not show your color ? 
Let's see what the Bulgarians hang around their tents . 
You certainly support the Irish team , right ? 
She looked at Harry , Ron and Hermione with small rounded eyes and gleaming eyes . 
After assuring her that they would certainly support the Irish , the pair went on to say , 
It's like we're talking about a bunch of blue guys . 
Hermione said : 
I wonder what Bulgarian fans are hanging on their tents ? 
Harry said , pointing to a large tent above the stadium , where white , green and red Bulgarian flags were fluttering . 
We went to see it . 
Their tents are not decorated with living plants , but on each of their tents an old poster is attached , and the posters promote a crooked face with heavy black eyebrows . 
Of course , that image moved , but all the stirring was just scowling at them and frowning . 
Said Ron , 
Krum . 
Asked Hermione . 
What ? 
Said Ron : 
Krum ! 
Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian defender ! 
Hermione looked around to see countless Krum frowning or scowling at him , remarking : 
The picture is very crowded . 
Ron raised his eyes to the sky : 
Are you crazy ? 
Who cares about the face of the nose ? 
Photos are not good . 
That picture is also very young . 
Just about eighteen or nineteen . Photo is a genius , you wait tonight tonight you will know ! 
There was a row of people tied together to get water in a corner . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood up after the two men arguing fiercely . 
One of them was a very old magician wearing a long pantograph . 
The other is obviously a magician of the Ministry of Magic . 
He was holding a striped trousers and almost cried out for irritation : 
Mr. Archie , please take care of this item . 
He could not walk around like that , Muggle guy at the gate started to suspect 
As the old gentleman said , 
I bought this suit at a Muggle shop . 
Muggles are still wearing it ! 
Mr. Archie , the Muggle women wear that , but men do not wear , they wear this . 
The mage of the Ministry of Magic fluttered the striped trousers . 
But old man Archie said in disgust : 
I do not bother with that stuff . 
I like having a bit of privacy around . 
Thank you . 
At this point , Hermione could not stop laughing , and she had to get out of the way , and only when Archie was done drinking and leaving , she returned . 
Now , due to the weight of the bucket , they walked slowly back across the tents to their campsite . 
They met familiar faces here or there : the Hogwarts students went to see them with their families : Oliver Wood , former Gryffindor Quidditch captain , just graduated last year . 
At Harry's , he pulled Harry to his tent to introduce Harry to his parents , and excitedly told Harry he had just registered for Puddlemere United's reserves . 
They were greeted by Ernie Macmillan . It was a fourth - year student at Hufflepuff . 
And going a little further , they saw Cho Chang , a pretty girl who played in the Ravenclaw squad as a Tail . 
She waved and smiled at Harry . 
Harry spat out too much water when he waved to her . To stop Ron's scorn , Harry hastily rushed to a crowd of teens that they had never seen before . 
She asked : 
Do you know who they are ? 
Are not they going to school at Hogwarts ? 
Said Ron : 
Probably they went to some foreign school . 
I know there are other schools . 
But I have never met anyone in another school . 
Bill has a friend who is studying at a Brazilian school . It's been a long time since he wanted to study abroad in an exchange program , but his parents could not afford the cost . 
When pictures say they can not go to school , the sentimental friend of the picture annoys and sends a picture of a concocted hat . 
The hat causes the ear to twist . 
Harry grinned to the astonishment of hearing of the other magic schools . 
Now that he has seen so many representatives of nationalities in the campsite , he thinks it's foolish to imagine Hogwarts as the only magic school . 
He glanced at Hermione , who was not surprised by the information . 
Certainly she had read the news of other magic schools somewhere in the book . 
When they finally got to the Weasley tent , George exclaimed , 
What are you doing now ? 
Ron put the kettle down : 
Because they met a few acquaintances . 
Did you not fire ? 
Fred said , 
He is playing with matchsticks . 
Mr. Weasley had not been able to shake a spark from the top of the match , though he tried his best . 
The matches scattered on the ground around him . 
He looked as determined to play the decision of life . 
Oh ! 
He screamed when he tried to strike a match and immediately squeezed it in surprise . 
Harry kindly said : 
Uncle Weasley , please come here . 
She took the matchbox in his hand , showing him the match . 
Eventually they also caught fire , and yet they also lost at least one more hour of flame support enough to cook food . 
However , in the meantime there are a whole bunch to watch . 
Their tent was almost plugged into one of the canals of the open field , and the Ministry of Magic officers rushed up and down the avenue , greeting Mr. Weasley intently as he passed by . . 
He 
Weasley continued to criticize , mainly to develop knowledge for Hermione and Harry , but his own children knew too much about the Ministry of Magic so much that they did not have much interest . 
It was Cuthbert Mockridge , the chief of the Liaison Office , Gilbert Wimple , who worked with the Chronicle Committee ; Arnie Arnold Peasegood , he's a Lube Expert - member of the Disaster Accidental Team , you know that , and that's Bode and Croaker they are specialists . Unidentified 
Yes , what are they ? 
They belong to the Ministry of Secret , top secret , nor do they do anything else 
Finally , when the fire was hot enough for them to start boiling eggs and baking sausages , Bill , Charlie , and Percy strode past the forest toward them . 
Percy said loudly : 
Dad , I just landed . 
Well , delicious , lunch here ? 
Everyone could barely eat half a plate of sausages and eggs , Mr. Weasley stood up , waved and grinned at the man who was hurrying toward them . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Gosh ! 
Mr. Ludo ! 
Current character ! 
Ludo Bagman was , of course , the most remarkable character Harry had ever met so far , including Archie's pensive pajamas . 
Mr. Bagman wore a long black Quidditch sweater with yellow stripes . 
On his chest was a great photo . 
He looked like a strong man , but now he's a bit down ; His loins are slightly strained at the waist , probably in the days when he played for England , he has not had the tank today . 
His nose was a bit crooked ( Harry thought , maybe a faint Bludger left broken ) . But his blue eyes , short blonde hair , and pinky look made him look like a schoolboy . big body 
Mr. Bagman happily called : 
Hello ! 
He was walking as if his heel springs were attached and it was obvious he was incredibly tall . went to the camp fire of the Weasley House , Mr. Bagman gasp : 
Hello old man Arthur ! 
How good is that ? 
It is a beautiful day ! 
We can not demand more perfect weather than this , right ? 
Tonight will be a cloudless night And without a hint of trouble in the organization there are not enough things that I have to hand ! 
Behind him was a scurrying mage who was hurrying past , pointing a distant evidence of a magical fire burning not only at the seven - meter - high violet fire . 
Percy hurried forward with his arms outstretched . 
Obviously , his refusal to accept the way Ludo Bagman manages his ministry has not prevented Percy from impressing him . 
Mr. Weasley laughs : 
Oh my , this is my son , Percy . 
He just started working in the department . 
This is Fred , is not it , sorry , it's George , the other is Fred , and Bill , Charlie , Ron , my daughter , Ginny , and two of Ron's friends : Hermione Granger and Harry Potter . 
Mr. Bagman was not a little suspicious of hearing the name of Harry , and his eyes made a familiar glance at the scar on Harry's forehead . 
Mr. Weasley continued : 
And please tell everyone , this is Ludo Bagman , you all know who he is , it is thanks to him that we get such good tickets . 
Mr. Bagman shook his hand as if it were worth talking about . 
He rubbed something in his gold - striped black shirt pocket , sounding like a pile of gold coins , eagerly said : 
Arthur Arthur , imagine the surprise of the match ! 
Roddy Pontner bets with me that the Bulgarian will score before I accept him , because the three attacking Irish players are the strongest ones I've seen in years and Agatha Timms has bet half My partner on the eel farm for fish is a game that will last one week . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Oh , so to watch a Galleon fishing Irish team win ? 
Mr. Ludman Bagman looked a little disappointed , but he immediately managed to : 
A gold coin Galleon ? okay , who else wants fish ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
They are too small , not gambling . 
Molly is not interested 
Suddenly Fred and George were out of pocket in their pockets , Fred said , 
We fish thirty - seven gold Galleon , fifteen silver Sickle and three Knut Irish wins , but Viktor Krum catches the Snitch . 
Oh , and we ' ll throw out a fake wand . 
Percy hissed . 
We have not been exposed to Mr. Bagman for that kind of rubbish . 
But Mr. Bagman does not seem to regard a wand as bullshit ; On the contrary , his pupil expression was very happy . 
He wrenched Fred's wand and waved a cry of guilt . 
The wand turned into a plastic chicken and he laughed : 
Excellent ! 
Long ago I have never seen anyone so convincing as this . 
I bought that five gold Galleon gold ! 
Percy stiffened in astonishment . 
Mr. Weasley whispered : 
My children , I do not want you to play the bet is all the savings of your cheeks 
Ludo Bagman said loudly , his hand shaking his bag shouting : 
Do not ruin the game , Arthur ! 
They're big enough to know what they want ! 
Will the Irish team win and will Krum catch Snitch ? 
No chance , boys , there is no chance I will let you be caught on We will also add five Galleons to that laughable wand , then we will 
Mr Weasley looked helpless as Ludo Bagman pulled out a notebook and a featherweight goose , and began to record the names of the twins playing fishing . 
George says : 
Play always ! 
He picked up a piece of parchment that Bagman gave him , tucked in his pockets of robes . 
Mr. Bagman turned to Mr. Weasley , more than ever : 
You invited me a cup of tea ? 
I'm looking for Mr. Barty Crouch . My Bulgarian partner is causing a lot of difficulties , which I do not understand at all what he says . 
Barty must have resolved this . 
Images speak about a hundred and fifty languages . 
Mr. Crouch ? 
Percy exclaimed , removing the cold expression from his face and putting on a frown of excitement : 
He speaks over two hundred voices ! 
What is the language , the language of the language and the language 
Fred arbitrarily interrupted : 
Who can not speak the Devil . 
Just pointing and panting . 
Percy threw Fred an extremely uncomfortable look and added a pile of charcoal to the fire to make the water boil again . 
Mr. Weasley asked Mr. Bagman after he had sat down on grass beside others : 
Is there any news about Bertha Jorkins ? 
Mr. Bagman said comfortably : 
Not a little bit of a whiff . 
But then you will appear again Poor Bertha girl Memory as a cauldron but do not know what direction . 
I believe in my words , she went lost . Until October , she will be ready to go to work , and new ideas in July only . 
Do not you think it's time to send someone to look for her ? 
Mr. Weasley hesitated when Percy gave him a cup of tea . 
Mr. Bagman opened his neutral - looking eyes saying : 
Barty Crouch kept saying that , but we really did not have anyone available at the moment . 
Ah , to mention the money reminded me of the spirit ! 
Barty ! 
A magician just popped up right next to the fire . 
He was quite the opposite of Bagman who was sitting on the grass in his old robes . 
Barty Crouch is an old , tall , straight - faced , hard - wearing man , dressed in an impeccable suitcase and tied with a knit tie . The straggled path on his hair was so unnatural that his thin toothbrush looked as neat as if he had trimmed it with a ruler . 
Your shoes are bright and shiny . 
Harry could understand why his idol Percy was . 
Percy was a follower of rigorous observance of the law , and Crouch complied perfectly with Muggle dress code so completely that he could mistype a director of a bank . 
Harry even suspected that Uncle Vernon may also be wrong about this witch . 
Mr. Ludo's face brightened , patted the ground beside him , telling Mr. Crouch : 
Pulled a ' grass ' to Barty . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
Thanks , Ludo . 
Crouch's voice was a little impatient : 
I went to find him everywhere . 
Bulgarians insisted on giving them twelve seats in the upper quarters . 
Mr. Bagman said : 
So that's what they insist on . 
I thought he wanted a pair of tweezers . 
The sound is not difficult to hear it ! 
Percy almost breathless and stooped in a bow that almost doubled , making him look like a hunchback . 
Mr. Crouch ! 
Do you want a cup of tea ? 
Mr. Crouch looked up at Percy with a look of surprise : 
Well , thank you , Weatherby . 
Fred and George sucked on their cup of hot chocolate . 
Percy blushed both earrings , but still poured tea and poured tea . 
Mr Crouch's sharp eyes looked at Mr. Weasley : 
Well , I also have some words to tell you , Arthur . 
Ali Bashir is aggressive . 
He wants to negotiate with you about his embargo . 
Mr. Weasley uttered a sigh : 
He sent me a report about that last week . 
I have already told him and say a hundred times that , as defined by the Forbidden Substance Registry , the carpet is considered to be the Muggle Work . 
But he did not listen to me ? 
Mr. Crouch received a cup of tea from Percy , saying : 
I think so . 
He wants to export carpet here . 
Mr. Bagman said : 
Well , those carpets are no way to replace the brush in the UK , right ? 
Mr. Crouch said : 
Mr Ali said there would be room for carpet in the family transportation market . 
I remember my grandfather used to have a Axminster carpet for twelve people - but of course that was before the carpet was banned . 
Mr. Crouch said as if he did not want anyone to understand much about his law - abiding parents . 
Mr. Bagman's fun : 
Do you look busy , Mr. Barty ? 
Mr. Crouch replied dryly : 
Relatively . 
Locating the port locks on five continents is not a big deal . Ludo , Ludo ! 
Mr. Weasley said : 
I'm sure you two will be glad when this is done ? 
Ludo Bagman looked amazed : 
Excuse me ? 
I do not know if there's a time when I'm happier now , but I'm not really expecting anything , are you , Barty ? Huh ? 
There are also occasions to organize , cup ? 
Mr. Crouch raised an eyebrow at Mr. Bagman : 
We agreed not to announce anything until all the details 
Mr Bagman dismissed Mr Crouch as giving a flying humming : 
Oops , details ! 
They signed it , right ? 
They have already compromised , but what ? 
I bet you are soon to know that these kids are all know ; I mean , it's going to happen at Hogwarts 
Mr. Crouch said , cutting off Mr. Bagman's words : 
Ludo , you know , we need to meet the Bulgarian . 
Thank you for your tea , Mr. Weatherby . 
He handed Percy a cup of tea and waited for Bagman to stand up . 
Mr. Bagman struggled to his feet , drinking tea in his cup , his golden coins jingling in his pocket . 
He said : 
See you all again . 
You sit in the upper class with me I'm the commentator that match ! 
Mr. Bagman waved , Crouch nodded curtly , and both landed invisible . 
Fred asked immediately : 
Dad , what's going on at Hogwarts ? 
What are they talking about ? 
Mr. Weasley smiled : 
You will know soon enough . 
Percy said in a tone of voice . 
It is confidential information , until the appropriate time , the Ministry of Magic will decide to disclose . 
Mr. Crouch is absolutely right to not disclose that information . 
Fred cried : 
Oh , hold on , Weatherby ! 
By late afternoon , an air of excitement rises throughout the camping area , just like a cloud of palpitations . 
At sunset , the calm summer air seemed to shake with anticipation , and as the darkness spread into the veil , taking on thousands of witchcraft wizards waiting impatiently , there was little trace . The traces of Muggle disguise are : The Ministry of Magic seems to have succumbed to the inevitable and tossed away the manifestations of the magical ritual everywhere . 
The sellers went up into every inch of the land , holding their trays , or pushing the cars full of bizarre items . 
There were bright red ribbons - red for Bulgarian fans , green for Irish fans - and screaming names of players . 
There are green pointed hats decorated with clover branches ; The Bulgarian scarf is decorated with lion figures . 
The flag of both countries is to emit the national anthem of their country . 
There are models of tiny lightning bolts , but also flying ones , and portraits of famous players , who take a stroll away from the picnic on the palms of people and do tune 
When Harry and Hermione walked through the street vendors to buy presents , Ron said , 
I spent the summer money for this occasion . 
Although Ron bought a three - leaf grass ball and a green rose bouquet , it also bought a picture of Viktor Krum , Bulgarian Bulldozer . 
The little Krum goes back and forth on Ron's palm , scowling at the green blaze above him . 
Wow . 
Look at those things ! 
Harry exclaimed , rushing to a hand cart full of the same thing as a bronze tube , but covered with all sorts of knots and knots . 
Selling witch rong to : 
Mystery monster here ! 
Being able to return to the past scene can slow down the progression and can be shot at every scene as needed . 
Ten Ten Galleon . 
Ron looked coyly at the cork , pointing at the dancing clover hat , 
Wish I did not buy this demon before ! 
Harry spoke sharply to the sales wizard : 
Sold for three pairs of tubes . 
Ron blushed : 
Do not do that . 
Ron is always very sensitive to the fact that Harry - the inheritor of his parents a small fortune - always have more money than it . 
Harry staggered into Ron and Hermione's hands and said , 
Do not be afraid , you will not receive any of your Christmas presents any more , in about ten years . 
Ron grinned . 
Well get going . 
Hermione said : 
Oh , thank you very much . I bought some of the program , so look 
Their money is small , they go back to the tent . 
Bill , Charlie , and Ginny were playing with green roses , and Mr. Weasley was holding an Irish flag . 
Fred and George had no toys , because they had given Bagman all their gold to bet . 
And then a gong sound , deep bass rang from somewhere on the other side of the forest . 
Immediately the green lanterns and red lanterns lit up on the tree tops , revealing the path leading to the stadium . 
Mr. Weasley looked eagerly excited like any of the children . 
He said : 
It's time ! 
Let's go ! 
Chapter 8 Quidditch World Cup 
Grabbing in his hands the letters he had just bought , Mr. Weasley took the lead , the children behind him , everyone hurrying to the woods , on the path illuminated by the lanterns . 
They can hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around , the laughter of the voice , the patting of the shoulders , the shaking hands , and the singing . 
The atmosphere is crazy like crazy everywhere . and Harry could not help but grin . 
They walked through the forest for about twenty minutes , loudly talking and joking , until they reached the other side of the forest and found themselves standing in the shadow of a super - great stadium . 
Although Harry saw only part of the mighty golden walls surrounding the stadium , he was sure the inside of the stadium was large enough to accommodate ten large churches . 
Seeing the amazement on Harry's face , Mr. Weasley explained , 
One hundred thousand seats ! 
A force of five hundred sorcerers working in the Ministry of Magic has made a full year to build this stadium . Every inch of this dungeon is cast aside Muggle . 
All year long , whenever there is a Muggle in the neighborhood , they suddenly remember an emergency appointment and immediately return to their homes . 
The last three hours , Mr. Weasley added pleasantly . 
He led the children toward the nearest entrance . There was also a crowd of witches and shamans screaming . 
A sorcerer at the Ministry of Magic stands at the ticket gate and says , 
First chair ! 
Hall of Honor ! 
Go straight up the stairs , Arthur , and go up all the way up . 
The stairs to the stadium were covered with dark purple carpet . The Weasley crowd climbed the crowd , past the door , the crowd spread out , going to the stands on the left or right . The Weasley continued climbing to the top , and they finally reached the top of the stairs to reach a large area of ​​ вЂ < вЂ < living , isolated in the highest position of the stadium , right in the middle of the gap between gold pole of two teams . 
There were about two dozen golden lacquered chairs in two rows in the area , with Harry and the Weasley cloaking in the front row , leaning down to look at the scene in which it was never imagined . What is so similar . 
Hundreds of thousands of witches and wizards are reaching their seats , which rise high up around an oval arena . 
Everything was flooded in a kind of magical golden light , the red light seemed to emanate from the stadium itself . 
From Harry's elevated position , he saw the field smooth and smooth . At each end of the field there were three golden posts , sixteen and a half yards high . 
Right on Harry's right , almost at eye level it was an extremely large panel . 
The golden words ran across the board as if the hands of an invisible giant were scribbling on the board and then smeared . 
Looking at the sign , Harry noticed the sign that was playing the words across the field : 
Green Bottle : A Spirit Tree for Every Family h - safe , reliable , and has a built - in anti - theft burner . . 
Skower's multi - purpose mottled scrub : No pain , no flaws ! 
Fashion magician festival = London , Paris , Hogsme ade 
Harry looked away from those signs to look back , watching who sat in the audience with them . 
So far , the chairs are empty , except for a tiny creature sitting in the second chair from the other end of the back row of Harry . 
That creature , so short legs that they protruded on the high chair , and he wrapped around his tea - tablecloth , looking like a shawl of the ancient Romans . 
The creature hid her face into her hands , but her long , pointed ears , like the bat's ears , looked so familiar to Harry , calling : 
Dobby ? 
The tiny creature looked up and stretched out his fingers , revealing two large brown eyes and the nose had the exact shape and size of a large tomato . It's not Dobby , but it's definitely an elf like Dobby , who was Harry's friend . 
It was Harry who helped Dobby escape his former employer , the Malfoys . 
Through the gap between the fingers , the elf exclaimed with a shrill voice : 
Are you calling me Dobby ? 
The voice of the elf was soaring , more than the voice of Dobby's former voice , which was a low - pitched , trembling voice . 
Harry doubted it was a female voice , though it was difficult for the elf to distinguish it . 
Ron and Hermione turned on the seat back to look . 
Although they both heard Harry talk a lot about Dobby , they never met Dobby . 
Even Mr. Weasley looked at him with pleasure . 
Harry told the elf : 
Sorry , I confused you with an old acquaintance . 
The elf uttered a high - pitched voice : 
But sir , I know Dobby too . 
The elf still covered his face with his hands , as if dazzled by the light , although the stand was not very bright . 
Sir , my name is Winky , and your name is yours 
The dark brown eyes of the elf opened as small as the fork when he saw the scar on Harry's forehead : 
You must be Harry Potter ! Harry said : 
Yes , I am . 
The eagle slightly lowered his hand a little , his face amazingly shocked : 
Monsieur Dobby always talks about you ! 
Harry asked : 
Really ? How free is she living ? 
Winky shook his head : 
Ah , sir , I do not mean disrespect , sir , but I'm sure that when you liberate Dobby you have done a good job for Dobby , sir . 
Harry's surprise : 
What happened ? 
What's wrong with you ? 
Winky said sadly : 
Sir , Dobby's headless freedom . 
And that idea was beyond Dobby's , sir . Where can I find other positions , sir . 
Harry asked : 
Why not ? 
Winky lowered his voice to half an octave , making his voice whisper : 
Sir , Dobby asks people to pay for the work it does ! 
Harry looked puzzled : 
Pay ? 
Oh , pay your salary ? 
Winky panicked when he heard the idea , hastily closed his fingers to hide his face . 
The elf said in a shrill voice : 
Sir , the wage earners do not have any salary ! 
No no no . 
I told Dobby : Dobby , go get some decent family and settle down . But sir , Dobby is putting on a lot of mischief , not really as an elf . 
I say , Dobby , you keep going like this , before anything goes out in front of the Mystery Maneuvers and Controls , like any mundane lobster . 
Harry said : 
Is it time for you to have fun ? 
Winky said to Harry severely , his hands still holding his face : 
Gentlemen are not allowed to play , Harry Potter . 
Ecclesiastes must do what the owner wrong . 
Like me , I do not like sitting on the highest , Harry Potter 
Winky glanced at the edge of the stage and slammed his voice down : 
But my boss sent me to the audience , so I have to go , sir . 
Harry frowned : 
But if you do not like sitting on high , why is he sending you here ? 
Winky turned his head to the side beside him , saying : 
My boss wants me to reserve a place for him , Harry Potter . 
The boss is very busy . 
Winky just wished to return to the owner's tent , Harry Potter , but the owner was wrong , Winky must do it . 
Winky is a good guy . 
The elf glared at the cover of the stage with fear and hidden his eyes . 
Harry returned to the people in his group . . 
Asked Ron , 
So it's an eagle ? 
Are they too weird ? 
Harry fervently said : 
Dobby is even more weird . 
Ron took out the probes and started checking . 
He watched the crowd down the yard , on both sides of the stadium . 
Easy to be scared ! 
He said as he turned the watch button on one side of the tube . 
I can make the guy down the nose to pick his nose and then pick his nose again 
At that moment , Hermione was eagerly scrolling through the plush and fringed planks . 
She read aloud : 
Before the game there will be performances of the spirit and mascot of the team . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Well , that's always worth watching ! 
You know that the national teams bring the mascots in their country to show off their flair . 
The top of the stage gradually adds four more people . 
Mr. Weasley had to shake hands with the apparently very important sorcerers . 
Percy stood up so stiffly that he looked like he was sitting on the back of a bird . 
When the Minister of Magic himself , Corneilius Fudge , arrived , Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and broke . 
Percy was embarrassed , welded the glass back and then sat down , throwing a jealous look at Harry , as he greeted Fudge as intently as he could . 
Fudge and Harry had met before , and Fudge shook Harry's hand as if the father had shook hands with him , asked him well , and introduced it to the sorcerers and sorcerers on either side . 
He said loudly to the Bulgarian Minister : 
You know , this is Harry Potter . 
The Bulgarian minister dressed in a gorgeous black velvet gown with gold trim and does not seem to understand a word in English . 
Mr. Fudge illustrates : 
Harry Potter I know you know who this kid was from Know - Who - who - knows - who knows who he is . 
The Bulgarian mage suddenly finds the scar on Harry's forehead and starts pointing at it sputtering excitedly and noisy . 
Fudge said to Harry , 
He finally understood . 
Uncle is not very good in this foreign language ; I need Barty Crouch in these kinds of things . 
Well , you see his elf holding his seat well , some uncomfortable bulldogs insist on the best places . A , Lucius ! 
Harry , Ron and Hermione immediately turned their heads . 
Spaniards along the second row to three vacant seats were behind Mr. Weasley , none other than the former Dobby's ex - boss : Lucius Malfoy and his grandson Draco Malfoy ; And the woman , Harry guessed , was Draco's mother . 
Harry and Draco Malfoy have become enemies since they met on the first train to Hogwarts . 
As a pudgy boy with blonde hair and blonde hair , Draco was just like his father . 
Her cheeks were blond , tall and slim , and she would have looked beautiful if she did not wear a face that looked as if she had a bad odor . 
Mr. Malfoy raised his hand as he approached the Minister of Magic : 
Well , Mr. Fudge . 
Are you fine 
I'm sure you have not met my wife , this is Mrs. Narcissa . 
And my son , Draco . 
Mr. Fudge smiled and bowed to Mrs. Malfoy : 
And please allow me to introduce you to Oblansk Obalonsk .. he , he is Minister of Bulgarian Ministry , and he does not understand a word that I say , but anyway it is okay . 
And let me see who else I'm sure you know about the Weasley family ? 
It was a stressful moment . 
Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other , making Harry remember the last time the two of them faced each other . 
It happened in the Bookstore and Han Han , the two have fought a fierce battle . Mr Malfoy's cold gray eyes swept Mr. Weasley's face , then glided over the island . 
He said softly : 
Oh , what did you have to sell to buy tickets to sit in the honorable Arthur ? 
What do you do with enough money ? 
Fear not , Fudge said : 
Arthur , Lucius has contributed generously to St . Mungo Hospital specializing in injury and disability . 
Today he is my guest . 
Mr Weasley said the tone was not very comfortable : 
That's great 
Mr. Malfoy's eyes looked at Hermione . 
She was a little red , but determined to look back at him . 
Harry knew what made Malfoy's lips so thick . 
The Malfoy family is proud to be a pureblood ; In other words , they regard any of the Muggle descendants , as Hermione , as being inferior , lower than they are . 
However , even under the nose of the Minister of Magic , Malfoy dared not say anything . 
He nodded at Mr. Weasley and continued on to his seat . 
Draco throws Harry , Ron and Hermione a look of disdain , turning to face down the court . 
Said Ron : 
guilty ! 
At that moment , Ludo Bagman burst into the air . 
He said : 
Are you ready ? 
His rounded face was radiant like Edam . 
Excuse me , Minister ? 
Mr. Fudge said comfortably : 
When you see it , you start , Ludo . 
Mr. Bagman shook his wand , pointed right at his throat and said , 
Sonorus ! ( That is , resonance ! ) 
And then he began to speak , a loud roar of earth shattering from the stadium filled with witches and wizards . 
Bagman's voice echoed above the cheers of the crowd , bouncing from every corner of the stands . 
Ladies and gentlemen Please be welcome ! 
Welcome to the Fourth and Twentieth World Quidditch Cup ! 
The audience cheered and clapped . 
Thousands of flags waving . 
The rumblings are more and more rampant when a series of national throats sound , the sound swirled each other . 
The giant table in front of the honor stand was wiped clean to the final ad ( Bertie Bott - Each Candy Dose was a Duel ! ) And now appears on the board : BUNGARI : 0 , HAPPY LAN : 0 
And now , there is no need to cross the three kingdoms , let me introduce the mascot blessings of the Bulgarian national team ! 
From the right side of the stage , where the sealed seats of the red shirt , the cheering sound resounded . 
Mr. Weasley leaned forward in the seat : 
I wonder what they bring to Aaaa ! 
Suddenly he scooped up the pair of glasses and hurriedly wiped it off his robes : 
Fairies ! 
What is a female ? 
But Harry's question was answered as hundreds of women surfaced . 
Fairies are women , the most beautiful women that Harry has ever seen . Only they can not be human . This made Harry question a moment as he tried to guess what exactly the fairy might be ; What makes the skin look like the moonlight shining smoothly , or the platinum hair fluttering behind them when there is no wind ? But when the music rises , Harry stops wondering that it is not . Actually , it stopped worrying about all things in the world . 
The fairies began to dance , and Harry's mind was completely blank . 
All of this world now has one thing in common : to enjoy the fairies of the fairies , because if the fairies stop dancing , surely there will be horrible things going on . 
And as the fairies dance faster and faster , the insane ideas that form ambiguous in Harry's head begin to instigate it . 
Harry wanted to do something , very impressive , right now . 
It seems like the idea of ​​ jumping from the stands to the stadium is a great idea , but it's not sure how to jump . 
Harry , what are you doing ? 
Hermione's voice echoed from somewhere far away . 
Music stopped . 
Harry blinked . 
He stood up , one foot on the stilts of the stands . 
Next to it , Ron froze in a posture that looked as though it was about to plunge from a billboard in the pool . 
The angry shout went through the stadium . The crowd did not want the fairies to leave at all . 
Harry also follows everyone . 
Of course he now wants Bulgarian supporters , and he wondered why he would wear the big green clover badge on his chest . 
At the same time , Ron also absentminded the clover on his hat . 
Mr. Weasley smiled slightly at Ron and took the hat off his hand . 
He said : 
Once again , when the Irish team performed , I would have wanted the hat again . 
Huh ? 
Ron gasped , eyes still glaring at the fairies standing on the other side of the pitch . 
Hermione chopped her tongue . 
She pulled up and took Harry to his seat , saying : 
Honestly ! 
Bagman's voice bellowed : 
And now , please raise your wand in the air . 
Invite the mascots of the Irish national team to perform ! 
Following it , there appears to be a great yellow and green comet scattered across the stadium . 
It flew around the stadium and split into two smaller comets , each swept towards the posts at the ends of the field . 
A rainbow suddenly crosses the stadium , connecting two light globes together . The crowd smiled all the way to AAAAAA as if watching the fireworks . 
Now the rainbow faded away and the two bridges of the two comets merged one and grew larger ; They formed a dazzling three - pointed arch , and the arch rose high into the sky and fluttered through the stands . 
From that blue dome it seemed to be falling something like a golden rain 
When the three - leafed dome floated through the hall of honor , the gold coins poured down like rain , echoing their audience and seats . 
Shouted Ron : 
Great ! 
Glancing at the dome , Harry realized that this was actually made up of thousands of tiny bearded men , dressed in red robes , and each with a gold or green tealight . 
Mr. Weasley said in the applause of the crowd : 
Bearded ! 
Many in the crowd are still fighting each other and scouring their chairs to pick up gold coins . 
Ron picked up a golden duster and put it in Harry's hands , saying : 
here 
Pay back the money to buy the mysterious tube nè ! 
So Christmas you have to buy gifts for yourself home . 
Ha ha ! 
The great trumpet spread out , the tiny bearded demons landed on the grass , facing the fairies , and then they sat cross - legged and watched the game . 
And now , ladies and gentlemen , warmly welcome the Bulgarian Bulgarian Quidditch team ! 
And here ! 
Dimitrov ! 
A man in bright red robes , riding on a broom , moved so fast that he could see only one of them coming from the gateway far below the pitch . 
Bulgarian fans burst into applause like crazy and scream : 
Ivanova ! 
A second player in the red shirt to the court . 
Zograft ! Levski ~ ! Vulchanov ! Volkov ! 
Andààaaaa Krum ! 
Shouted Ron . 
He's there ! 
He is 
She uses a mysterious tube to track Krum , and Harry is quick to spot the tube . 
Viktor Krum is sickly , black , skinny , with a thick nose and black eyebrows . 
He looked like a big bird of prey . 
It is hard to believe that he is only eighteen years old . 
And now , welcome to the Irish National Quidditch team ! 
Mr. Bagman continued to scream : 
Please introduce yourself : Connolly ! 
Ryan ! Troy ! Muller ! Moran ! 
Quigley ! Andaaaaaa Lynch ! 
Seven shades of green blur into the stadium ; Harry twisted a small knot on his hip to see the players slow down . 
He saw the lightning bolts on each broomstick that the players were riding on , and saw their name , embroidered with silver on the back of their shirt . 
And here , our referee , who has made the journey far from Egypt to here , would like to introduce : Quidditch International Board Quiz President , Mr. Hassan Mostafa ! 
A small wizard , boneless skin , wolf head , but with a mustache rivalry with Uncle Vernon's whiskers , and yellow robes in harmony with the panorama of the stadium . 
He strode out to the court . 
A silver whistle sank beneath his mustache , and a large wooden bucket was clamped under an ax , his armpit clamping a broom . 
Harry turned the speed button on the side of the tube to return to normal rhythm , watching close - up Mr. Mostafa climb up the broom god and kick the wooden crate open - Four boys shot out into the air : a boy The dazzling red quaffle , the two black bludgers , and the tiny golden Snitch , with wings ( Harry just saw it in a blink of an eye , it disappeared ) With a sharp whistle , Mostafa jumped into the air . the balls . 
Mr. Bagman shouted : 
They have come out . 
And Muller is having a ball ! 
Tr oy ! 
Moran ! Dimitrov ! Banh returns to Muller ! 
Troy ! Levski ! Moran ! 
It was a Quidditch match that Harry had never seen before . 
He squeezed the tube through his glasses , so tight that his glasses were cut in pain . 
The speed of the players unbelievably unbelievable . 
Traitors threw Quaffle into each other so quickly that Bagman only had time to scream out their names . 
Harry had to turn the slow - eyed button again to the right of the tube , pressing on both the look - up button at the top of the tube , and it immediately looked at the slow motion , while the purple Flick through the lens and the sound of the crowd eavesdropping on the eardrum . 
Harry just read the words of the United Republican Army has watched three Irish players flying together , Troy in the middle , slightly faster than Mullet and Moran slightly ahead of the Bulgarian team . 
Next up was the warm temperament , then Troy stepped up and dropped the Quaffle for Moran . 
One of Bulgari's attackers , Volkov stabbing a flying Bludger with his small stick , slammed it against Moran ; Moran dodges the Bludger and releases the Quaffle ; Levski rushed down to catch it 
Mr. Bagman shouted : 
Troy Makes the Table ! 
The stadium shook as clapping and screaming broke out . 
10 - 0 . 
Points for Ireland ! 
Through his mysterious tube , Harry looked around with a blank stare , shouting : 
What ? 
Levski caught the Quaffle ! 
Hermione was dancing happily and swung her arms in midair as Troy flew a glorious round of the stadium . 
She shouted : 
Harry ! 
If you do not watch the match at normal speed then you will miss many things to watch ! 
Harry looked up through the top of the mysterious pipe and saw the tiny bearded dwarfs sitting on the edge of the tent , watching the tigers on the sidelines , flying all the way to the sky and forming a large , shimmering , leaf - shaped figure . 
Across the court , the fairies looked at the bearded creature . 
Rushing to himself , Harry turned the speed button back to normal when the game continued . 
Harry's Quidditch qualities are enough to make him aware of the talents of the Irish players are super pants . 
They played rhythmically as a consistent , their movements so well that Harry had the impression that they could read each other's minds by dividing their positions between them , and the rose bows On Harry's chest , he hissed at the names of the players : Troy Mullet Moran ! 
And in just ten minutes , the Irish side scored two more goals , raising their lead to 30 - 0 , causing a tsunami of cheers , applause from the crowd . The crowd is wearing green shirts . 
The game is getting faster and faster , but it's also more violent . 
Volkov and Vulchanov , two Bulgarian attackers , used the Bludgers heavily on Irish players , and started to play some of the best tactics ; Twice the Irish players were forced to fly , and then , finally , Ivanova found a way to break the ranks of the Irish team ; fooled by captain Ryan , and scored the first goal for the Bulgarian team . 
Mr. Weasley shouted as the fairies began to dance to celebrate the victory : 
Put your finger right ear ! 
Harry just covered his ears and kissed his eyes ; It wants to keep the mind awake to watch the match . 
After a few seconds , he opened his eyes to the arena . 
The girls have ceased dancing , and the Bulgarian team is controlling the Quaffle . 
Mr. Bagman screamed : 
Dimitrov ! Levski ! Dimitrov ! Ivanova , dear parents ! 
Hundreds of thousands of witches and wizards gasped for breath as two rifles from Krum and Lynch dashed down through the action center , so fast they looked as if they had just jumped off the plane . do not bung though . 
Harry watched their down through the mysterious tube , swinging the tube to see where the Snitch was . 
Hermione sat next to Harry , crying out : 
They are going to crash ! 
She was half way through - At the last moment , Viktor Krum sprung up and flew up the spiral . 
But Lynch touched the ground with a croak , loud enough for the whole stadium to hear . 
From the seats of the Irish fans echoed a giant moan . 
Mr. Weasley whined : 
idiot 
Killed by Krum . 
Bagman's voice screamed again : 
Pause the match ! 
The medical wizards are rushed to check out Aidan Lynch ! 
Charlie patted her on Ginny , leaning against the wall , her face panicked : 
He is okay , the picture just bruises himself ! That is the target Krum . 
Harry hurriedly clicked on the View - button - scene on his multi - purpose tube , rotated the speed dial , and then back up to the eye . 
It sees Krum and Lynch plunging in slow motion . 
The bright purple letter crosses its lenses : WRONSKI TREATMENT - TROPICAL STRATEGY . 
Harry saw Krum's face scowling as he focused his attention when he hurried back into the sky , while Lynch collapsed . 
And Harry understood - Krum did not see Snitch at all , he just pretended to let Lynch do the imitation . 
Harry had never seen anyone fly like that ; Krum's flying is hard to believe that he's riding a broom , he's moving around the air as easily as he does not have any weight and no need for a footprint . 
Harry turned his tube back to normal speed and concentrated on Krum . 
He now circled over Lynch , while Lynch was revived by medical mages with a few cups of water . 
Harry concentrated closer to Krum's face , seeing his dark eyes peering across the ground below him thirty feet . 
He enlisted the time Lynch was recovering to find the Snitch without any resistance . 
Finally Lynch stood up straight , a cheer from the fans of the Irish team . 
Lynch climbs up his Lightning Rod , bounces backwards , and rushes into the air . 
Lynch's recovery has given Ireland a new edge . 
When Mostafa blew his whistle for the game , the players moved in a rhythmic manner with the unmatched ingenuity that until now Harry had seen for the first time . 
After about fifteen minutes of fast and fierce competition , the Irish had to score another ten goals . 
Now the Irish are leading 130 - 10 , and the game is getting worse and worse . 
As Mullet fired towards the post again , holding the Quaffle in his hand , the Bulgarian captain Zograf flew out . 
Something happened that was so fast that Harry did not catch up , but from the Bulgarian fans flickered angrily , and the shrill whistle of Mostafa squeaked , informing him that there was a bad play . 
So Mostafa penalized the Bulgarian captain for using too long elbow ! 
Mr. Bagman informed the crowd of screaming indignantly : 
And yes , the penalty for the Irish team ! 
The little bearded demon , as soon as Mullet was playing badly , soared into the sky forming a bunch of angry maneuvering wasps , now spread out arranged into a few words HA ! 
HA ! HA ! The ladies across the yard stood up , broke their hair in anger , and started dancing . 
Immediately , Harry and the Weasley boys put their fingers in their ears , while Hermione thought it was unobtrusive . 
But she grabbed Harry's arm . 
Harry turned to look at the little girl , and Hermione tugged Harry's fingers out of his ear . 
She giggled , saying : 
Look at him referee ! 
Harry looked down at the field . 
Hassan Mostafa landed in front of the fairies and he acted in a strange way . 
He bent his muscles and clawed his mustache clumsily . 
Mr. Ludo shouted , though his voice seemed to be delighted : 
Ridiculous , can not afford to be so ! 
Should someone slap the referee a go ? 
A medical surgeon crossed the court very fast , with his thumb pressing the hole , to the stone in the shade of Mostafa a strong . 
Mostafa was awake ; Putting the multifunction bulb on his eye again , Harry saw his payload shamelessly shame and began to scream at the fairies , forcing her to stop dancing and show her displeasure . 
Bagman's voice resounded : 
And if I'm not mistaken , Mostafa is trying to get the Bulgarian team out of the stadium . 
Ah , now there's a story we've never seen before . Well , this could get worse . 
That's right : the Bulgarian squads , Volkov and Vulchanov , landed on Mostafa's referees and started to argue with him , raising their hands to point at the tiny bearded demon Hi ! 
HI ! HI ! 
HI ! . 
Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarian opposition . 
However , he swung his finger to the sky , apparently wanting the Bulgarian players back up there to continue the match , and when they refused to do so he blew two short whistles . 
Mr. Bagman shouted : 
Two penalties for Ireland ! 
Bulgarian supporters burst into anger . 
Mr. Bagman continued to report : 
And Volkov , Bulchanov should rode up to the gods and fly over . Well they came back and Troy was getting the Quaffle . 
The match has now reached a fiercer level than any match the witches have ever seen . 
The players of both teams acted with little hand in hand , cruel ; Volkov and Bulchanov show no particular interest in having their staff bashed into the bludger or in the middle when they were madly in the air . 
Dimitrov crashed straight into Moran , who was holding the Quaffle , almost whipping her out of the broom . 
Irish fans stand up in a fierce green wave rising , screaming : 
Bad play ! 
Ludo Bagman's voice was magnified with magic also ringing a clear : 
Sorry ! 
Dimitrov dug up Moran - deliberately flew to touch people - so the penalty is again - yes , the siren was ringing . 
The tiny bearded dwarfs again rise up into the air , and this time , they form a giant hand . 
That hand made a very real impression on the fairies beyond the court . 
The girls were mad . 
Instead of dancing , the fairies poured themselves across the field , throwing their tiny bearded whiskers into something that looked like fireballs . 
Watching the fairies through the mysterious tube , Harry saw that they were not as pretty as they looked . 
On the contrary , the face of the long - winded form of the bird's head is gritty , on the shoulder of the scab wings . 
Mr. Weasley shrieked on the chaos of the crowd below : 
that you understand ! That is why one should not just judge by beauty ! 
The magicians of the Ministry of Magic came to the courtyard to break up the tiny bearded demons and the fairies ; But they are not very successful either . 
Meanwhile , the aerial match was no less fierce than the fight on the ground . 
Harry just pointed his mysterious tube up high and low , watching the game while watching the match , while the Quaffle left consecutive hands with the speed of the tablet . bullets fly . 
Levski - Dimitrov - Moran - Troy - Mullet - Ivanova - Moran got the ball again - Moran - MORAN DONE ! 
Irish fans cheered , but their cheers were filled with the screams of the fairies , the blast coming from the wandheads of the Ministry of Magic wizards , and the roar of anger of Bulgarian fans , go away . 
The match is continued immediately ; Now Levski is on the ball , passing the Irishman's Dimitrov . Quigley is on the verge of blowing a massive left over bludger , and it splashes with tremendous strength on the defensive side of the squad . The Bulgarian is Krum . 
He did not dodge , tucked the ball in the face . 
From the crowd was a loud moan to deafness . 
Krum's nose seemed to be cracking , blood on his face , but referee Hassan Mostafa did not blow the whistle for a pause . 
He was confused . 
And Harry did not feel guilty , because a fairy had thrown a fire at his gods and made him burn . 
Harry just wanted someone to notice Krum was injured ; Even though it was a supporter of Ireland , Krum was the most exciting player in the game ; Ron obviously feels the same . 
Suspended ! 
Ah , look , he can not wait , so look at him 
Harry screamed : 
Look at Lynch ! 
The Irishman's sudden fall , and Harry is sure this time is not Wronski's lure ; this is killing 
Harry yelled : 
Photos seen Snitch ! 
Pictures see it ! 
Look at the picture down ! 
Half of the crowd seems to notice something is going on ; Irish fans sprang up in green waves , screaming their knights . But Krum was following Lynch's tail . 
Harry did not understand how Krum could see where he was going . 
Along with Krum are drops of blood coming back in the air , but Krum keeps up with Lynch and reaches the same level as Lynch ; Now they are hitting each other down the ground again 
Hermione cried out : 
They are about to crash ! 
Ron roared : 
Do not be ! 
Harry cried : 
Lynch is dead ! 
Harry was right - The second time Lynch landed on the ground with tremendous force and immediately collapsed under the wrath of the girls around him . 
Charlie screamed down the line : 
Left Snitch ? 
Where is Snitch ? 
Harry screamed , 
Snapshot ! 
Krum got caught ! 
The match is over ! 
Krum in the red shirt flushed from his nose , gently flying up into the air , holding his high hand , the golden light flashing from his hand . 
In the crowded sea , the scoreboard flashes the words : 
BUNGARI : 160 , HAPPY LANES : 170 
The crowd did not seem to understand what had happened . 
Then , as if the giant jet engine had just opened , the screams of Irish fans grew louder and finally burst into a roar of joy . 
Mr. Bagman shouted : 
WELL LIKE LANSELF ! 
Mr. Bagman was delighted with the Irish team but was bounced back by the unexpected end of the match : 
KRUM SNITCH BUTTERFLY - BUT SMALL LANCER - I do not believe any of us are expecting such a result ! 
Ron jumped up , his hands raised high on the head , but it also screamed : 
What did Snitch do ? The game ended in the 1 - 0 victory over Ireland . 
Seriously stupid ! 
Harry clapped his hands like crazy , shouting back to Ron : 
Pictures know the team's image never equalized . 
The players of the Irish team too excellent Photo wants to end the game in favor of the photo , so 
Hermione continued : 
Pictures of courage too ? 
Look at the picture was badly injured . 
Hermione leaned forward to see Krum landing in a place where medical witches were exploding a path through the tiny fairies and mustaches , to get to him by caring for the wound . injured . 
Harry put the multifunction tube on his eye again . 
It was hard to see what was going on there , the bearded creatures fluttering across the stadium happily , but then it also looked out Krum among the medical wizards . 
He looked more irritable than ever and refused to let the medical shaman wipe the wound . 
The teammates surrounded Krum , who all shook their heads sadly . 
That way not far , the Irish players jubilantly jubilant in the rain of gold by the bearded rabbit scattered down . 
Everywhere the Irish flag and Irish national flag are echoing throughout the stadium ; The fairies are now filming under the normal good looks , though apparently see the hope and down the spirit . 
A mournful voice resounded behind Harry : 
Fattening , they fight well . 
Harry looked back . It is the Minister of Magic of Bulgaria . 
Mr. Fudge blurted out loudly , 
So he speaks English ! 
But you keep me playing all day long ! 
Bulgarian Minister of Magic shrugs : 
Embryos , I love you ! 
Mr. Bagman was still shouting : 
And while the Irishman and their blessing are flying around the stadium to respond to the fans , the Quidditch World Cup is on the way to the stands ! 
Harry's eyes suddenly flickered away from the glare of the white light , when the honor stands suddenly shone with mysterious lights , so that people from the other stands can see the progress here . 
With his eyes fixed on the door , Harry saw the two wizards panting as he carried a giant gold cup to the stands . 
They handed over the trophy to Mr. Fudge , who seemed to be angry enough to have used his hand all day in vain . 
Mr. Bagman shouted : 
We spent a really warm applause for the team lost a brilliant way - the Bulgarian team ! 
And there are seven Bulgarian champions in the stands . 
the crowd applauded beneath ; Harry could see thousands and thousands of multipurpose probes pointing up and aiming at it . 
One by one , Bulgarian players lined up in the middle of the stands on the stands , and Bagman named one player to shake hands with their own Minister of Magic and Fudge . 
The end of the line is Krum , it looks terrible . 
His dark eyes bloomed strangely on his bloody face . 
He still holds Snitch . 
Harry noticed that he seemed a bit clumsy on the ground . 
His shoulders are rounded up unequivocally , and his legs are short as a nap . 
However , when the name Krum was invoked , the whole stadium roared with a loud thud . 
And now to the Irish team . 
Aidan Lynch is being channeled by Moran and Connolly ; The second earthquake seems to make him dizzy , and his eyes are bizarrely distorted . 
But he still grinned as Troy and Quigley lifted the trophy up to the sky , and the crowd at the bottom burst into laughter . 
Harry's hand was so numb that it was numb . 
Finally , when the Irish team left the stands to make a glorious flight around the stadium on their broomstick in response to the specter of spectators , Bagman pointing his wand at his throat : 
Quietus ! ( Meaning : Silence ! ) 
( Aidan Lynch was riding on Connolly's back , his hands clutched firmly on the frog's waist and still grinning with a bewildered look ) 
Mr. Bagman said hoarsely : 
They will be talking about this game for many years . Thor is an unexpected reversal . Sadly , the game does not last long . Oh yes , how much do you owe me ? 
It was because Fred and George had just jumped out of their backs and stood in front of Ludo Bagman with a radiant face , while his mouth was loud and his ears were pointing straight in front of him . 
Chapter 9 Signs of black 
As the Weasleys slowly walked down the purple carpeted stairs , Mr. Weasley said with a frown . Fred and George : 
Do not tell your chil - dren about the betting odds ! 
Fred replied happily . 
Do not worry . 
We have great plans to spend this money , we do not want it to be impulsive . 
In a flash , Mr. Weasley seemed to want to know what those great plans were , but then he seemed to decide after thinking that he should not know what to do . 
Soon the crowd was overwhelmed by the stadium and returned to their campsite . 
The hoarse voice was filled with the night's rain that reached their ears as they stepped back on the trail lit by lanterns hanging from the top of the tree , and the tiny bearded dwarf appeared again . their heads , giggling and swinging their lanterns . 
Finally , when they reached the tent , no one was feeling sleepy , and with all the noise around , Mr. Weasley agreed that everyone could drink a cup of chocolate before going to bed . 
Soon everyone was excited about the match ; Mr. Weasley was involved in a heated argument with Charlie about the shocks , and only until Ginny had fallen asleep on the small table that caused the chocolate to fall to the floor , Mr. Weasley asked to suspend the match . By the mouth , and stressed that everyone must go to bed . 
Hermione and Ginny walked over to the side of the tent to sleep , and Harry and all the rest of the Weasley family changed their sleepwear and climbed onto the bed . 
People still hear the chorus and loud explosions from the other side of the campsite . 
Mr. Weasley murmured , sleepily : 
Oh , I'm glad you're not on duty today . 
I can not imagine what it would take to tell the Irish to give up their celebration . 
Harry lay on the first bed , above Ron's bed . 
He still managed to open his eyes to the naked ceiling of the tent , watching the occasional stream of light through the hut as the tiny bearded drones flew over the tent roof with their delicious lanterns . 
It re - imagines some of Krum's spectacular moves . 
She was eager to get her ride on her lightning bolt to experience the Wronski lure . Perhaps Oliver Wood had never described the zombie lure in the zigzag diagrams . The picture of Harry's imagination saw himself wearing his shirt on his shirt , and imagined his feelings when he heard a crowd of hundreds of thousands roaring , while Ludo Bagman's voice echoed . Around the stadium : Please introduce to Mr. Potter audience ! 
Harry did not know if it had actually fallen asleep - its imagination soaring and Krum's fantasy transformations could turn into a real dream - the only thing it knew . Yes , Mr. Weasley suddenly screamed out loud : 
Wake up ! 
Ron ! ... 
Harry ! ... 
Get up quickly , this story is very fast ! 
Harry sat up immediately , causing his head to touch the ceiling of his father's tent . 
She asked : 
What's wrong ? 
In a vague way , he guessed something was wrong . 
The noise in the campsite has changed . 
Singing stopped . 
He heard screams , and his voice ran low . 
He slipped out of bed and put on his clothes . 
But Mr. Weasley , who was trying to get his jeans out of his sleeping pants , said , 
There is no time when Harry just put on a coat , run out to Mau Mau ! 
Harry followed Mr. Weasley's words and rushed out of the tent , Ron clutching his heel . 
In the light of some burning fire , Harry could see people running wild in the woods , trying to escape something that was moving through the empty field toward them , something Lighted up the sounds and sounded like explosive guns . 
The mockery , crazy laughter , and drunken screams were pouring in Harry's ; and then a bright green light suddenly shone and illuminated the scene . 
A crowd of wizards , thrusting their shoulders like wings , came up with wands pointing straight ahead . 
They are crawling across the field . 
Harry looked at them . They did not appear . But then they realized their heads were covered with a hat and masked . 
Above them , floating in the air are four figures struggling and twisted into horrible shapes . 
It seems that masked witches on the ground are puppet performers , while those above their heads are puppets controlled by invisible wires connected to their wand heads . . 
Two of the four are tiny . 
As more and more mages entered the parade , laughed and pointed to the floating form . The parade expanded to where the tent camp collapsed there . 
A couple of times Harry saw everyone in the parade group waving his wand to blow up a tent . 
Many tents caught fire . 
The cries grew louder and louder . 
As the crowd passed by the burning tent , the four of them floated abruptly on the high , illuminated , and Harry recognized one of them : Roberts , the camp manager . 
The other three looked like his wife and children . 
One of the marchers used a wand to knock Roberts over his shoulder ; Her pajamas hang down to reveal the lush underpants inside and she struggled to cover herself up , while the people below hissed , squealing pleasantly . 
Looking at the smallest Muggle baby , he was twisted in the air at two feet , his head slackening to one side and then to the other , Ron murmured : 
It is sick . 
The disease is out of place 
At that moment , Hermione and Ginny rushed to them , running their cloak out of their pajamas , followed closely by Mr. Weasley . 
At the same time , Bill , Charlie , and Percy came in from the little boy's tent , dressed up , his sleeves rolled up , and his wand was ready . 
Mr. Weasley rolled up his sleeves , shouting loudly at the noise : 
We will help the Ministry ! 
Run into the forest , and always stay together ! 
As long as you finish this , you will come to meet me . 
Bill , Charlie , and Percy sprinted toward the parades to block their heads . 
Mr. Weasley also ran after his three grown sons . 
Wizards of the Ministry of Magic are coming all the way to the source of the chaos . The parade below the Roberts family came closer to them . 
Fred grabs Ginny's hand , starts pulling her toward the forest : 
Run fast ! 
Harry , Ron , Hermione and George followed . 
When they reached the tree , they all looked back . Crowds of people under Mr. Roberts ' family are now more crowded than ever . 
They can see the Magician's wizards looking for a way through the crowd to reach the masked ones in the middle , but they are so hard . 
They seem to be reluctant to use any spell casts because they can make the Roberts fall to the ground . 
Multi - colored lanterns illuminate the trail leading to the stadium that has been drained . 
The shadow of the black man groping through the woods ; children cry ; screams of anxiety and screaming voices resounded in the cold night air around . 
Harry felt himself being pushed over when he was rushed over , but he could not see any human faces . 
Suddenly he heard Ron cried out in pain . 
Asked Hermione , 
What's going on ? 
The girl stopped so suddenly that Harry slammed into her . 
Ron , where are you ? 
Oh , how stupid like this Lumos ! ( Shine ! ) 
She lighted her wand and pointed the small patch of wand to the front to illuminate the path . 
Ron is lying on the ground mango . 
He stood up , angrily said : 
Affected by a tree roots . 
Wipe your legs and legs so that you do not stumble as well . 
A voice squeaked behind them . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione turned around . 
Draco Malfoy was standing alone , leaning back on a tree , exuberant . 
Hands folded in front of the chest , Malfoy seemed to enjoy the scene taking place at the campground through the gap between the trees . 
Ron told Malfoy to do something Harry knew Ron was not going to say in front of Mrs. Weasley . 
Malfoy's pale eyes widened . 
Take the words that say listen to Weasley ! 
Why do not we just quit now ? 
Do you want to be in her position ? 
Malfoy jerked his head at Hermione , and at that moment a loud explosion resounded throughout the campsite , and for a moment a green gleamed the forest around them . 
Said Hermione , her voice challenging : 
What do you want to say ? 
Malfoy said : 
Granger oi , they are hunting Muggle . 
Do you want to underwear the sky ? 
Because if you keep going around here , you're going to be performing this way , and we ' ll have the opportunity to laugh at the door . 
Harry shouted : 
Hermione is a witch ! 
Malfoy grinned brusquely . 
Just follow your Potter style , stay there if you think they can not tell a Mudblood . 
Shouted Ron : 
Watch out your mouth ! 
Everyone is here to know Mudblood is a derogatory name that is very offensive to a witch or wizard from the Muggle family . 
Do not mind , Ron . 
Another burst of noise from the other side of the tree , louder than any sound they heard . 
Many people nearby screamed . 
Malfoy chuckles his tongue . 
It said with plastic voice : 
So ? 
I'm sure you run away , do not you ? 
What is he doing ? ... 
Finding ways to save those Muggles ? 
Harry's anger surged : 
And your parents ? 
The masks out there are probably your parents , right ? 
Malfoy looked back at Harry , smiling : 
Wow , if that's them , I'm going to tell you , Harry ? 
Hermione looked at Malfoy full of disgust : 
Well , stop it . 
We go to find the other . 
Malfoy said with derision : 
Take your head off , Granger ! 
Hermione drags Ron and Harry along the path , urging them again : 
Stop it ! 
Ron said impatiently : 
I dare to bet anything that his father is one of those masked . 
Hermione enthusiastically said , 
Well , maybe the Ministry of Magic will catch him . 
Oh , I can not believe this . 
Do not know where the other people go ? 
They did not see Fred , George , or Ginny anywhere , even though the trail was now crowded with human beings , all anxiously staring at the chaos at the campsite . 
A bunch of kids wearing pajamas were arguing over the path . 
When they saw Harry , Ron and Hermione , a long , thick , curly - haired girl , turned around and said , 
Où est Madame Maxime ? 
Nous I ' avons perdue ( French : Where is Maxime ? 
We lost her ) 
Said Ron : 
What ? 
Oh 
She turned her back to Harry , and as they walked on , they heard her say , 
Hogwarts . 
And Hermione murmured : 
Beauxbatons . 
( French : Boogie : Nice sticks . ) 
Harry said : 
Sorry , what do you say ? 
Hermione explained : 
Those are Beauxbatons students . 
You know that the Beauxbatons Institute of Arts reads about that school in the evaluation of the magical education in Europe . 
Harry : 
Yes . 
Ron pulled out his wand , lit up like Hermione's wand , squinted down the trail . 
It says : 
Fred and George can not go far . 
Harry reached into his jacket to retrieve the wand , but did not find it . 
The only thing it can find is the multi - purpose tube . 
Oh no , I can not believe I lost my wand ! 
How are you ? 
Ron and Hermione held up their wand to light the small chopsticks on the ground . 
Harry looked around , but still did not see his wand anywhere . 
Said Ron : 
You may have forgotten it in the tent . 
Hermione anxious assumption : 
Maybe it fell on the road when we plugged in . 
Harry said : 
Oh can 
Normally , while living in the wizarding world , Harry always holds his wand with him , so finding out that he has no wand in his hand in the middle of a ruckus makes him feel very good . risky . 
Suddenly there was a rush that made all three jump up . 
It turns out that Winky is struggling to get out of a grove nearby . 
The elf is walking in a very weird manner , obviously very hard . 
It was as if an invisible man was trying to pull it off . 
When the elf came forward and rushed , he screamed in a panicked voice : 
Bad wizards are somewhere ! 
People are floating in the middle ! 
Winky must get out of here . 
And the elf disappeared from the trees across the trail , gasping for breath , and shrieking in relief as he struggled to resist the power of suppressing it . 
Ron looked curiously at the elf : 
What was that elf ? 
Why can not it run normally ? 
Harry said : 
I did not ask the owner to let it go . 
Harry thought of Dobby : every time Dobby tried to do something that the Malfoys , his former boss , did not like , the elf was forced to wall himself . 
Said Hermione indignantly : 
You know the hip , the elf was treated very unfairly ! that is slavery , yes it is ! 
Mr. Crouch forced Winky up into the high ceiling and made him scared to death , then allowed him to even escape and could not escape , when the tents were crushed crushed . 
Why did not anyone do something about this pass ? 
Said Ron : 
To watch , the elves are happy , right ? 
You guys have heard Winky on the stage before the game is not ' elves are not allowed to play ' Winky is like that like to be mischievous 
Hermione began to heat up : 
It is because of people like you , Ron , who control over injustice and corrupt systems , just because they are too lazy 
Another blast of earthquakes echoed from the edge of the forest . 
Said Ron : 
Do we continue to go ? 
Harry saw Ron glare at Hermione . 
Maybe Malfoy's words are true : Maybe Hermione is more dangerous than they are . 
The three of them went quickly , and Harry was still searching for the wand in his pockets , even though he knew his wand was not in his pocket . 
They follow the path increasingly deep in the forest , looking for Fred , George and Ginny . 
They walked past a group of goblins giggling with a gold bag that was sure to just win at the campsite . 
Still walking along the path , they went further , under a sparkle of silver glitter , and as they peered through the trees , they saw three beautiful tall fairies standing in the middle of a gap , Surrounded by a bunch of young wizards , all of them are talking about the ramparts . 
One of them said , 
I shattered about a hundred gallons of Galleons every year ! 
I am the dragon killer for the Dangerous Organics Committee ! 
Friends of that hand yell : 
Duck ! 
You are the dragon killer ! 
You are a dishwasher at the Cai Vac shop , I'm the vampire hunter , so far I've killed ninety 
The third young witch , whose face is full of acne , looks in the faint silver light emanating from the fairies , but still sees the acne , interrupting your words , saying : 
I'm about to become the youngest Minister of Magic , I'm going to do it ! 
Harry grumbled . 
He recognized the third young wizard , Stan Shunpike , and he was , in fact , on the three - tiered Knightshop that Harry had been hitchhiking . 
Harry turned around and told Ron about this , but Ron's face was bizarrely bored , and soon he screamed , 
Did not I tell you that I had invented the flying broom to Jupiter ? 
Hermione said : 
Honestly ! 
She and Harry grasped Ron's arm tightly , turned it around , and pulled it away from it . When the voices of the fairies and the bragging rights of the heroes ceased , the three of them were deep in the forest . 
It seems that now only three of them are here . 
Everything is too quiet . 
Harry looked around . 
You know , we thought we were here waiting . 
Anything that comes within a mile of us can be heard right away . 
With that word still out of his mouth , Ludo Bagman appeared behind a tree in front of them . 
Even with the fragile light of two wands , Harry could see a great change in Ludo Bagman's personality . 
His face is no longer young and fresh roses . 
His footsteps did not budge anymore . 
He looked white and extremely tense . 
He blinked at the three little children , tried to look at their faces and asked : 
Who's that ? 
What do you do here alone ? 
The three little girls looked at each other in amazement : 
Said Ron : 
There is a riot going on . 
Mr. Bagman glared at Ron : 
What ? 
At the campsite some people caught a Muggle family 
Mr. Bagman swore arrogantly : 
Tang it ! 
He was so mad and did not say a word , he disappeared after a small cough . 
Hermione was stunned : 
Mr. Bagman does not grasp the situation , right ? 
Ron led the way down the path leading to a small void , sitting down to a patch of grass under a tree . 
It says : 
Anyway , he is also a great helper . 
He also played in the Wimbourne Corn Wiggins team , which won the League Cup three times . 
He hooks the tiny Krum statue out of his pocket , puts it on the ground , and watches the statue walk around . 
The same is true of the Krum guy , this statue also has a scapula and a rounded shoulder , but it does not look as good on his bare feet as when Krum flew on a broomstick . 
Harry sat listening to the static from the campsite . 
Things seem to have been very quiet ; Maybe the violence is over . 
A moment later Hermione said , 
I hope the others are okay . 
Said Ron : 
They're okay . 
Harry sat next to Ron watching the Krum statue go dry on dry leaves . 
It says : 
Imagine your daddy caught Mr. Malfoy ? 
I heard him say that he wanted to give him a match . 
Said Ron : 
That would have wiped Malfoy's smug smile off ? 
Hermione was anxious : 
But poor for Muggle people too . 
If people can not save them ? 
Ron said to Hermione , 
People will be saved . 
People will find a way to save . Hermione said : 
Anyway , it's crazy too , do something like that while the entire Ministry of Magic has it all here tonight ! I mean , how are those troublemakers expected to get out ? 
Think about it , or are they drunk , or are they just drunk ? 
But she suddenly stopped talking and looked back over her head . 
Harry and Ron were quick to look around . 
It sounded as if someone was dragging toward the vacant lot they were sitting on . 
They waited , listening to the sound of limping steps from behind the shadowy dark trees . 
Suddenly the footsteps stopped . 
Harry called : 
Hello ! 
Silent . 
Harry stood up and looked at the tree around him . 
It was too dark to see beyond , but it still felt like someone was standing just beyond its sight . 
She asked : 
Who's that ? 
And suddenly , without warning , the silence was broken by a voice unlike any voice they had heard in the forest . 
The voice blurted out , not exactly a scream , but there was a mantra of the mantra : 
MORSMORDRE ! ( Latin , mors = death ; mordre = mordere = bite . 
Morsmordre means : The bite of death god ! ) 
And in the dark , Harry tried to pierce his eyes , something huge , green and sparkling , suddenly bursting . 
She flew to the top of the tree and flew up into the sky . 
Ron gasped , standing up on his feet tiptoe to try to look at the known object : 
What is this ? 
For a split second , Harry thought it might be a different set of tiny bearded creatures . 
But then he realized that the object had a giant skull , made of something that looked like jade stars , with a python poking out of his mouth like a tongue . 
As they looked at it , the object flew higher and higher , then faded away in the blurry smoke , printed in the black sky like a new galaxy . 
Suddenly , many of the forest around the three little children burst into screams . 
Harry does not understand why , but the only reason he can sound rational is the presence of a skull . 
Now that skull flew up high enough to illuminate the forest , like a neon sign - he was horrible . 
Harry scanned his eyes through the darkness to look for the man who allowed the skull , but he could not see anyone . 
Call it again : 
Who's that ? 
Hermione grabbed Harry's coat collar and tried to pull it back : 
Harry , hurry up , run ! 
Harry was surprised to see Hermione's face bleary . 
What's going on ? 
Hermione tightened her grip on Harry , moaning : 
Harry , that's a black sign ! 
The sign of Who - knows - who - knows - who ! 
Of Voldemort ? 
Harry , run away ! 
Harry turned around - Ron hurried to capture the tiny Krum statue - all three began to cross the gap - but before they could make a few quick steps , Before the appearance of two dozen magi , from the air appearing around them . 
Harry turned around and immediately noticed an event : each of these wizards held his wand straight ahead , and all of his wands were directed at Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Without thinking for a second , Harry screams : 
DIVE ! 
He clutched the other two and pulled them to the ground . 
Twenty voices roared : 
CONFUSION ! 
A series of flashes of lightning made Harry feel the hair on his head waving as if there was a very strong wind blowing through the empty space . 
Head up a little , she saw the red light flashing back and forth between them from the wands , crossing each other , pounding on the trunk , then bouncing back into the darkness . 
Then a scream that sounded familiar : 
Stop ! STOP ! That is my son ! 
Harry's hair was blown away . 
He raised his head a little more . 
The magician standing in front of him dropped his wand . 
He turned his eyes around and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them , looking horrified . Ron Harry Hermione Are you all right ? 
His voice trembled . 
Another voice , coldly cursed : 
Get out of the way , Arthur ! 
that's Mr. Crouch . 
He and other ministers are approaching the scene . 
Harry stood up and faced an angry face . His sharp eyes swept over the three little children : 
Which of you did that ? 
Which one of you called the Black Sign ? 
Harry made a mark on his skull , saying , 
We do not make that . 
Ron brushed his two elbows with an irritated look at him : 
We did not do anything ! 
What are the nails attacking us about ? 
Mr. Crouch said : 
Do not lie , sir ! 
His wand still pointed straight at Ron , and his eyes were rolling out , and he looked a little mad . 
You were caught in the scene ! 
A witch wearing a woolen coat says , 
Barty , are they kids , they do not have the capacity to do that Barty ? 
Mr. Weasley asked immediately : 
Three children say , Where does that black mark come from ? 
Hermione shuddered to the spot where they had heard a voice before : 
Over there 
At that time there was someone behind the trees shouting out a mantra . 
Mr. Crouch now turned his eyes toward Hermione , doubtful : 
Ah , that's over there , right ? read a mantra ? 
Lady , well , you know enough about how to call a Black Sign 
But with the exception of Crouch , Ron and Ron Hermione , no one in the Ministry thought that the three had called up the Black Sign ; On the contrary , after Hermione said , they all raised their wand and pointed at the direction Hermione had pointed , eyes fixed around her . 
The witch - witch shook his head : 
We're too late ! 
They are sure to land . 
A sorcerer with stunted antennae said : 
I do not think so . 
It's Amos Diggory , Cerdic's father . 
He continued : 
Our mercenaries have gone through the trees . It is very likely that they will catch them 
Amos Diggory twirled himself , raised his shoulders , raised his wand , walked across the drum , some warnings warned him : 
Amos , be careful there ! 
But he went missing into the dark . 
With his hands clenched open in fear , Hermione watched him disappear into the woods . 
Just a few seconds later , everyone heard Amos shout : 
here it is ! 
I caught them ! Here are some people ! 
Lost consciousness this is but , oh my 
Mr. Crouch shouted in a voice without any confidence : 
Who caught you ? Who ? Who is that ? 
Everyone heard the shriek of the tree , the rustling of the leaves , and then the sound of his footsteps . Diggory reappeared from behind the trees , his hands holding a tiny , motionless figure . 
Harry recognized the instant tea tablecloth . That's Winky . 
Mr. Crouch did not budge or say anything when Mr. Diggory put the elf on the ground next to his feet . 
Wizards of the Ministry of Magic saw Crouch . 
For a few seconds , Mr. Crouch stood stunned , glaring down at Winky . 
Then he seemed to wake up . 
He said gingerly : 
This can not be . 
Are not ! 
He walked quickly , rounding Mr. Diggory and strode in the direction that Winky had been spotted . 
He called with the followers : 
Useless , Mr. Crouch , there's nobody else there . 
But Mr Crouch does not seem to want to hear from Diggory . 
People could hear his footsteps going around and rustling leaves as he brushed the bushes aside to hunt for the sword . 
Mr. Diggory looked down at Winky's motionless figure , saying , 
Also confused . 
Barty Crouch's elf Well , I'm going to say it 
Mr. Weasley quietly said , 
Come out of that place , Mr. Crouch , you do not seriously believe your elf is the culprit ? 
The black mark is a sign of the witch , a new wand is needed . 
Mr Diggory said : 
right . 
And this elf has a wand . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
What ? 
Mr. Diggory raised a wand and handed it to Mr. Weasley . 
Here , try to look . 
I took from the elf . 
Thus , the third law of the use of the wand has been violated . 
Non - human beings are allowed to carry or use wand . 
At that moment there was a blast , and Ludo Bagman landed right next to Mr. Weasley . 
He seemed short of breath and uttered utmost speech . 
He walked around the scene , then looked up at the jade blue skull in the sky . 
He gasped , almost stomping on Winky as he turned to torture his colleagues : 
Signs black ! 
Who do ? 
Did you catch that person ? 
Barty , what happened ? 
Mr. Crouch returned with empty hands . 
His face was still white as ghost , and his hands and beard brush his teeth , both twisted . 
Mr. Bagman asked : 
Where did you go , Mr. Barty ? 
Why are not you in the match ? 
Your elf has a place to give him that Devil Devil ! 
Mr. Bagman found that Winky was lying on his feet : 
What's wrong with that ? 
He replied , still in the tone of a rumble ginger , hardly smirked to his lips : 
I'm busy , Ludo . 
And my elf fell unconscious . 
Fainted ? 
Are you going to say it's me ? 
But why ? 
The knowledge suddenly dawned on Mr. Bagman's glossy face . 
He looked up at the black sign in the sky , then looked at Mr. Crouch . 
He said : 
do not get ! 
Winky ? 
Call on the Black Sign ? 
He did not know how to do that . 
At the very least , it must have a wand first . 
Mr Diggory said : 
And it has a tree . 
I found it holding the wand , Ludo . 
Mr. Crouch , if you do not object , I suppose you should hear how this self - defense elf is . 
Mr Crouch did not show any signs that he had heard what Mr Diggory said . 
But Diggory seems to regard Mr Crouch's silence as meaningful . 
He raised his wand , pointed right at Winky and shouted : 
Enervate ! ( Meaning : Revive ! ) 
Winky faintly wiggled . His huge brown eyes opened and he blinked several times in astonishment . 
Watching the mages around , the elf sits up . 
He saw Diggory's briefcase first , and then slowly , trembling , his eyes fixed on his face ; It is also very quiet , it looked up a little higher up the sky . 
Harry could see the skull hovering over them , reflected in two in wide open eyes . 
Winky gasped , looking around the crowd around him in the middle of the empty space , and he was scared to burst into tears . 
Mr. Diggory sternly said : 
Leprechaun ! 
Do you know who I am ? 
I am an official of the Ministry of Mystery Ordinance Inspectorate ! Winky began to fall backwards and dive forward on the ground , his breath beginning short and panting . 
Harry remembers Dobby's vivid imagery at his terrible times when he was not obediently obedient . 
Mr Diggory continues : 
As you can see , goblins , the black mark was called up in this place not long ago , and only then later you are detected below the sign ! 
Allow yourself to explain ! 
Winky gasped and said , 
My uncle , I do not do anything smoothly ! 
I do not know anything smooth , my dear 
Mr Diggory : 
Mi was discovered with a wand in his hand ! 
Mr. Diggory swung the wand in front of the elf . 
And when the chopstick was shining in the blue light , it fell on the vacant land from the tall skull , and Harry realized . 
It says : 
Hold your wand ! 
Everyone in that vacant land turned to look at Harry . 
Mr. Diggory doubted asked : 
What do you say ? 
Harry said : 
that's my wand ! 
I dropped it . 
Mr. Diggory repeated with unbelievable looks : 
Did you drop it ? 
Is that a confession ? 
After calling up the Sign , did you throw it aside ? 
Mr. Weasley was very angry : 
Amos ! 
Please think about who you are talking about ! 
Are we going to suspect Harry Potter who called up the Black Sign ? 
Mr. Diggory hardy throat : 
Of course not . Sorry for the past 
Harry pointed his finger at the tree below his skull . 
However , I did not drop it in that place . 
As soon as I got to the edge of the forest , my wand was gone . 
Diggory's eyes became ruthless as he turned to look at Winky again , the elf shrugging at his feet : 
So you found this wand , did not you , goblin ? 
And you picked it up and thought you were going to have fun with it , right ? 
Winky cried out , tears streaming down his flat tomato nose : 
My dear sir , I do not know what to do , my dear son , I do not know what to do ! 
Hermione said : 
Not her ! 
Hermione looked nervous as she spoke in front of all the bureaucrats of the Ministry of Magic , but she persisted anyway : 
Winky had a shrill shrill voice , and the voice we heard the mantra was lower . 
She looked at Harry and Ron for support : 
That voice did not sound like Winky's voice at all , right ? 
Harry shook his head and said : 
Are not . 
That voice was definitely not the voice of an elf . 
Said Ron : 
right . That is a human voice . 
Mr. Diggory does not seem to care about that detail , but he growls : 
Well , they will know soon enough . 
There is a simple way to discover the last mantra that a wand has made , do you know how it is , the goblin ? 
Winky shuddered and shook his head like mad , his ears fluttering as Diggory held up his own wand and clutched it to Harry's wand . 
He roared : 
Prior Incantato ! ( That is : The last mantra ! ) 
Harry heard Hermione gasp and panicked as he saw the skull had a huge snake tongue coming out from the point of contact of two wands , but it was just a shadow of a green skull in the high plume . above them . 
The newly formed skull seemed to be a thick gray smoke : it was the ghost of the mantra . 
Mr. Diggory says : 
Deletrius ! ( Meaning : erase ! ) 
The head of the smoke turns into a smoke . 
That's it ! 
Mr. Diggory uttered a ferocious voice , looking down at Winky , who was trembling tremblingly . 
Winky cried , two huge eyes wide in fear : 
I do not do that ! 
I do not have ! 
I do not do that ! 
I do not know what to do ? 
I am a good ego , I do not use my wand , I do not know where to use it . 
Mr. Diggory growled : 
The goblin ! 
Mi was arrested at the battle was good enough ! 
Caught with a wand still in hand ! 
Mr. Weasley said loudly : 
Amos , let's think about that , even the magician who reads the magic spell is also rare . Where does the elf learn that talent ? 
Mr. Crouch said , anger in each cold statement : 
Perhaps Mr. Amos thinks I often teach my elf how to call the Black Sign ? 
An uncomfortable silence enveloped . 
Mr Diggory seems alarmed : 
Mr. Crouch does not bother 
Mr. Crouch shouted : 
He was approaching the accusation that the two most unlikely criminals had called up the Black Sign in the woods . that's Harry Potter and me ! 
Amos , I'm sure you were too familiar with this little boy story . 
Mr. Diggory seemed uncomfortable , his mouth murmuring : 
Of course , nobody knows 
And I also believe that you remember a lot of the evidence that I made , in my long career , that I despised and disgusted the Dark Arts and those who practiced that art , do you remember ? 
Mr Crouch croaked as loudly , his eyes almost looming out . 
Mr. Diggory muttered , his face reddening after a jagged beard . 
Mr. Crouch , I never thought you had anything to do with it ! 
Mr. Crouch screams louder : 
If you accuse my elf , as you accuse me , Mr. Diggory ! 
Where else can you learn to call a black sign ? 
It could learn gleaning somewhere 
Mr. Weasley said : 
That's right , Mr. Amos . 
Could it be learned somewhere ? Winky ? 
Exactly where did you get Harry's wand ? 
Mr. Weasley's voice sounded nice when he turned to the elf , but he still panicked . 
Winky twisted the tea tablecloth that he was wearing so violently that the wraparound cloth was scraped under his fingers . 
I found it over there , sir , in that tree , sir . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
See Amos ? 
Regardless of who was the one who called up the Black Sign , he landed as soon as he finished , throwing Harry's wand away . 
It is a wise trick not to use the wand itself , because the wand can counter . 
And Winky was actually just unlucky enough to meet the wand at a later moment and pick it up . 
Mr. Diggory lost patience : 
But that proves it can be in a place just a few steps away from the crime scene . 
Leprechaun ! 
Do you see anyone ? 
Winky was trembling and fiercer than ever . His huge eyes were reversed from Mr. Diggory to Mr. Ludo Bagman , to Mr. Crouch . 
Then he swallowed and said : 
My dear sir , I have no one to see anyone else . 
Mr. Crouch said in a voice : 
Mr. Amos , I am fully aware that , in the normal course of the event , he will want to keep Winky in his office for questioning . 
However , I ask you to allow me to deal with it . 
Diggory did not seem to have taken much of a consideration of the proposal , but it was obvious to Harry that Crouch was a key figure in the Ministry of Magic so much that Diggory dared not deny his request . 
Mr Crouch added in a cold voice : You can be sure it will be punished properly ! 
Winky looked up at Mr. Crouch , tears streaming down his face . 
It stammered begging : 
Boss , boss , please 
Mr. Crouch glared back at the elf , his face stiffened as though each line on his face sharpened . 
He did not show any pity at all . 
He said slowly : 
Winky has behaved in a way that I can never believe . 
I told him to stay in the tent . 
I told him to stay in it while I went out to solve the trouble . 
And I see that he did not listen to me . 
That means wearing clothes . 
No , it is not ! 
Winky screamed , shrugging at Crouch's feet : 
Boss , please do not ! Do not give clothes , please do not give clothes ! 
Harry knew that the only way to free an elf was to give him a dress or dress code . 
Look at the scene Winky clutching the tea table cover while crying at his feet Crouch is pitiful . 
Hermione scowled at Crouch , 
But in her panic ! 
She is afraid of the height that the masked magician is picking people up in the air . 
He could not blame her for avoiding the disaster ! 
Mr. Crouch stepped back , avoiding touching his elf . 
The way he looked at Winky was as if it was something very filthy , which could contaminate his shiny shoes . 
Then he looked up at Hermione , coldly saying : 
I do not use an elf do not obey me . 
I do not use a servant who forgot his duty to his boss , and did not know how to honor his boss . 
Winky cried so loudly that its cries echoed through the vacant land . 
Everyone was silent , finally Mr. Weasley ended the silence by saying quietly : 
Well , I think I would lead my little tent , if no one objected . 
Mr. Amos , that wand gave us all the information he could provide . So give it back to Harry . 
The Diggory returned the wand to Harry , and Harry put it in his pocket . 
Mr. Weasley said softly : 
Let's go , kids ! 
But Hermione did not seem to want to budge ; Her eyes still can not leave the crying elf . 
Mr. Weasley urged : 
Hermione ! 
She turned away with Harry and Ron from the open field , through the woods . 
But right after getting out of the vacant lot . 
Hermione said to her question : 
What will happen to Winky ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
I do not know ! 
Hermione was angry : 
The way people treat Winky is too much ! 
Mr. Diggory just called her goblin and Crouch ! 
He knew she was not doing bad , so he kept on chasing her ! 
He did not bother to count on her horror or pain as if she were not human ! 
Said Ron : 
Winky is not a person ! 
Hermione turned to Ron : 
Does not that mean she does not have feelings , Ron ? 
It is disgusting to treat like that 
Mr. Weasley said quickly , advising her : 
Hermione , I agree with you . 
But now is not the time to debate the power of goblins . 
Uncle wants us to return to the tent as quickly as possible . 
What happened to the others ? 
Said Ron : 
We lost them in the dark . 
Daddy , why are everyone so anxious about such a long head ? 
Mr. Weasley said tensely : 
When returning to the tent three will explain everything . 
But when they came to the edge of the forest , the road was blocked . 
A huge crowd of frightened wizards and wizards are gathering there , and when they see Mr. Weasley walk towards them , many come forward : 
What happens in that ? 
Who calls it up ? 
Arthur's not sure about him ? 
Mr. Weasley said in a very impatient voice : 
Of course not ! 
We do not know who the culprit is . 
It seems they have landed . 
Now please allow me to go , sorry I want to go to bed . 
Mr. Weasley led Harry , Ron and Hermione through the crowd and returned to the campsite . 
Now all is quiet . 
There are no masked shamans , though many tents are devastated still fuming . 
From the tent for his son , Charlie poked his head out . 
He called over the darkness : 
What's going on ? 
Fred , George and Ginny came back , but the others 
Mr. Weasley crouched into the tent , saying : 
You brought them back here . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione had just crawled into the tent behind him . 
Bill was sitting next to a small table , clutching a bedclothes for his bleeding arm . 
Charlie had a tear on his shirt , and Mr. Percy had nosebleeds . 
Fred , George and Ginny were not injured , though very frightened . 
Bill asked quickly : 
Is there no catch ? 
The caller on that black sign ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Are not . 
People caught Crouch's eldest brother holding Harry's wand , but no one knew more about who had actually called up the Black Sign . 
Bill , Charlie and Percy both exclaimed : 
What ? 
Fred also called : 
Harry's wand ? 
Percy's voice sounded like he was struck by lightning : 
Mr. Crouch's elf ? 
Thanks to Harry , Ron and Hermione added a couple of places , Mr. Weasley reported what happened in the forest . 
As the story ends , Percy puffs up angrily : 
Well , Mr. Crouch chased an elf like that was absolutely right ! 
Leaving it clear he told her not to make him shy about the whole Ministry of Magic . If it was brought before the Ministry of Mystery Ordinance and Inspection , what else could it be ? 
Hermione resists Percy now : 
She did not do anything wrong ? 
She just happened to be at the scene at the right time ! 
Percy seems to have been countered by Hermione . 
Until now , Hermione was in harmony with Percy , in fact , more in harmony with Percy than with all the others in Weasley . 
Percy calmly said to Hermione in a voice : 
Hermione , a mage in Mr Crouch's position , could not tolerate an elf holding a wand like a madman ! 
Cried Hermione : 
She is not running like crazy ! 
She just picked it up on the ground ! 
Asked Ron impatiently : 
to misery ! 
Can anyone please explain what the skull is for ? Seeing it does not hurt anyone why people are so fussy like that ? 
Before anyone could reply , Hermione joked : 
I told you Ron , that's Who - Who - Know - Who's icon . 
I read that in The Darkness of the Dark Arts . 
Mr. Weasley quietly added : 
And for thirteen years no one ever saw that symbol again . 
Of course , one must panic to see that symbol , as well as to see Who it is who - knows - who . 
Ron snapped out : 
I still do not understand what that means is that it's just a sign , a shape in the sky 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Ron , who - who - knows - who - and his men emit a black sign up to the sky whenever they kill . 
The horror has been aroused the children are too young , do not understand where . 
Imagine returning home , seeing the black sign on the roof of your family , and know that you will find something in your home . 
Mr. Weasley blinked : 
That is the worst fear of the most terrible people 
Everyone was silent for a moment . 
Bill then removed the blanket to check the wound on his arm . 
I said : 
Well , no matter who called the Black Sign will not help us tonight . 
As soon as I saw the Black Sign , the Death Eaters were swept away . 
We have not even come close to peeling off the mask of one of them , they have landed indigestion . 
May we meet the Roberts before they land . 
They are now being reconciled to memory . 
Harry asked : 
Death Eaters ? 
Death Eater is what ? 
Bill said : 
It is the name of the people who belong to the Who - who - also - know - it - self . 
I think we may have seen the rest of our hands and feet tonight that they have somehow escaped Azkaban . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
We can not prove it's them , Bill , though it's probably theirs . 
Ron suddenly said : 
it's correct ! 
I bet they are fish ! 
Daddy , we met Draco Malfoy in the woods , and it almost admitted to us that he was one of those masked people ! 
And we all know too well that the Malfoys are the one - knows - who - who - the - brigade's wing . 
Harry opened his mouth : 
But the Voldemorts 
The people around Harry shivered . 
Like most people in the wizarding world , the Weasley family always avoids saying Voldemort . 
Harry hurriedly said : 
Excuse me , those who know - who - who - know - what - you - want - what - are - hungry Muggles I mean the meaning of that action . 
Mr. Weasley laughed . 
Meaning ? 
Harry , that's their entertainment . 
Up to half of all Muggles killed when Killer - Who - Know - Who - are powerful just because they want to kill for fun . 
I suppose this evening they drunk and drunk the urge to remind us that they were far outlawed . 
They gathered quite well , not less . 
Mr. Weasley said with disgust . 
Asked Ron : 
But if they are Death Eaters , why are they so obscure when they see the Signs ? 
Should they be happy to see that sign ? 
Bill said : 
Ron , I'm a little brainstormed . 
If they are true Death Eaters , then when the One - who - also - knows - who - lost power , they must have struggled to get rid of sin , have poured all their sins on him . - who - well - know - it , that he himself has forced them to slaughter and torture Muggles . 
I bet that when they see him back , they are more afraid than we are afraid anymore . 
When he lost power , they denied everything that rode with him , and returned to their normal lives . He saw Who - who - knows - who - that would not be very satisfying . with them , right ? 
Hermione said slowly : 
So , let's just say someone called the Black Sign . Does he do that to show support for the Death Eaters , or to scare them away ? 
Mr. Weasley said : 
Your estimation is like that of your doctors , Hermione . 
But let me tell you this . Only the Death Eaters know how to call that sign . 
You would be surprised if the person who called up the Black Sign was not a Death Eater , even though he may not be here anymore . Listen to me , it's late now , and if you Your child hears what happened , how does she also worry about getting sick ? 
We have a few more hours to sleep and then try to catch the port early to get out of here . 
Harry goes back to his bed with a bee - like mind . 
He knew it should have been tired : it was almost three o ' clock in the morning , but his eyes were still open and alert . 
Three days ago - sounds like it's been a long time , but it's only been three days - Harry was awake with a scar on his forehead . 
And tonight , for the first time in thirteen years , the icon of Dark Lord Voldemort appears on the bench . 
What does this mean ? 
Harry thought of the letter it had written to Sirius before leaving the house on Privet Drive . 
Do not know Sirius has received yet ? 
As long as the new reply ? 
Harry lay on his back looking at the roof of his father's tent , but now there is no mythical figure floating in his mind to soothe his brain , bringing a sleep . 
Long after Charlie's snoring echoed throughout the tent , Harry finally fell asleep . 
Chapter 10 The Chaos of the Ministry 
After a few hours of sleep , everyone was awakened by Mr. Weasley . 
He used the spell to tidy up the tents , then left the camp site quickly , passing Roberts in front of his hut . 
On the face of Mr. Roberts there was a strange look , and he raised his hand to wail the Weasley with his dream : 
Merry Christmas ! 
As they passed through the field , Mr. Weasley said , 
Then he will be fine . 
Sometimes , when a person's memory is adjusted , that person gets a little silly for a while . Saying it , makes him forget that it's a big job not to play . 
As they approached the Lockport location , they heard voices in an urgent manner ; Upon arriving , many wizards and wizards are gathered around Basil , who manages the Key - Port ; Everyone screamed out loud , demanding to leave the campground as quickly as possible . 
Mr. Weasley had a quick discussion with Basil ; They are waiting in line , and finally can ride an old tire back to Stoatshead before the sun rises . 
They walked through the village of Ottery St . Catchpole and back onto the dreamy trail at the Burrow Farmhouse in the dawn of dawn , talking a little bit because everyone was tired , and just thoughtful . to breakfast . 
At the corner of the road and the Burrow Farm appeared in sight , they heard a voice echoing through the road leading to the alley : 
Oh thank god heaven ! 
Mrs. Weasley , apparently she had waited long in the front yard , now rushed toward them , her feet still in her usual slippers , her face pale , her hand clenched The Proclamation of the Prophet . 
Arthur Arthur I worry so worried 
He threw his arms around Mr. Weasley's neck , and the Daily Prophet fell off her numb fingers dropping to the ground . 
Harry looked down and read the headline : QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP PERSPECTIVE , illustrated with a flashing black and white image A black sign above the tree tops . 
Mrs. Weasley muttered like a madman : 
You're okay . 
She let him out to look around all the children with red eyes : 
Oh , you're still alive boys 
And everyone was surprised to see her embrace Fred and George in arms , so tight that two heads together . 
Ouch ! 
Mommy cheeks choking us too 
Mrs. Weasley began sobbing : 
I scolded you before you went ! 
You always think about it ! 
If you - who - well - know - who - what do you do ? 
At last , my mother told me that you do not have enough Regular Sorcerer's Certificates ? 
Oh Fred , George 
Mr. Weasley took his wife out of the twins , leading the family into a gentle voice to his wife : 
Well , go home , good , Molly , we're all alone . 
He added to Bill , his voice smaller : 
To get back to that newspaper , what would you like to see ? 
As everyone gathered around the small table in the kitchen , and Hermione made a bold tea for Mrs. Weasley , a cup of tea Mr. Weasley insisted on adding a bit of Ogdens . Bill gave Mr. Weasley the newspaper . 
Mr. Weasley glanced at the front page as Percy read over his shoulder . 
Mr. Weasley said in a heavy voice : 
You know , the Department of management did not catch the assassin loose loose inspection of the black sorcerer National humiliation Who write this article ? 
A Rita Skeeter of course ! 
Percy said , 
She always talks to the Ministry of Magic ! 
Last week she wrote that we were wasting a lot of time doing the cauldron , while we should have stopped the vampires ! 
It is as if one did not particularly emphasize it in the twelfth section of the Guidelines on the Treatment of Non - Poisoned Human 
Bill yawned : 
Percy , give everyone a favor , im going to give people a thanks ! 
Mr Weasley's eyes widened behind the glasses as he read the last paragraph of the paper in The Daily Prophet : 
He is also mentioned . 
Where ? 
Mrs Weasley choked on the tea , and said , 
If you read it , I know you are alive ! 
Mr. Weasley said : 
There is no name . 
Listen : ' If the witches and wizards are scared of waiting for news at the edge of the forest waiting for a reassurance from the Ministry of Justice , they are sadly disappointed . 
An official from the Ministry of Magic came out of the forest . The black sign appeared that no one was injured , but refused to provide any further information . 
It is unknown whether this statement is true or not . The rumors are that many comics were taken out of the forest about an hour later . ' Oh , really ! 
Mr. Weasley was furious , giving the newspaper to Percy : 
No one was injured . 
What else can I say ? 
The rumors are that many of the bodies have been taken out of the Hmong forest , after the publication of this article , there will inevitably be rumors spread ! 
Mr. Weasley took a deep sigh : 
Molly , you will have to go to work ; This has to be settled . 
Percy said with great conviction : 
I will go with three , three . 
Mr. Crouch will need everyone to contribute . 
And you should hand over his report on your cauldron . 
He leaped out of the kitchen . 
Mrs. Weasley was very upset : 
Arthur Arthur , he is still on vacation . 
This has nothing to do with your department ; Surely people will solve where it does not need him . 
Mr. Weasley said : 
You have to go , Molly . 
He made the situation worse . 
I change and I will go now 
Harry suddenly spoke up for not being able to keep his heart : 
No , Hedwig brought you any letters ? 
Mrs. Weasley was bewildered : 
Hedwig ? 
No , no letters . 
Ron and Hermione looked at Harry curiously . 
With a meaningful look on his face , Harry said , 
So can I bring my stuff to my room , Ron ? 
Said Ron : 
Oh , me too . 
Is Hermione gone ? 
Hermione said : 
Let's go . 
The three of them walked out of the kitchen and went upstairs . 
As soon as they closed the door of the croaking room , Ron said , 
What is it , Harry ? 
Harry said : 
There is something I have not told you . 
On Saturday morning , I woke up because my scar was aching . 
Ron and Hermione's reaction is almost exactly what Harry imagined when he was at Privet Drive . 
Hermione gasped and promptly made some suggestions , referring to a number of reference books , and suggested that people attend from Pomfrey , the Hogwarts school nurse , to Dumbledore . 
Ron was dumbfounded in fear : 
But he was not there , did he ? 
Who - knows - who - knows - who ? I mean , last time , you had a painful scar at the Hogwarts School , did not you ? 
Harry said : 
I'm sure he was not in his aunt's house . 
But I have a dream to see him and Peter you know , Worm's tail . 
Now I can not remember all the details of the dream , but then they are plotting to kill somebody . 
Harry was just about to say something to kill her , but it did not make Hermione more alarmed when she was too scared . 
Ron comforted : 
It's just a dream . 
Just a nightmare . 
Harry looked out of the window , the sky clear . 
Oh , but is that just a dream ? 
Strange enough , is not it ? ... 
My scars hurt , three days later the Death Eaters came out , and Voldemort's icon appeared in the sky . 
Ron hissed through his gritted teeth : 
do not - say - out - name - of - him ! Harry did not care about Ron , continued to say : Remember what Professor Trelawney said ? At the end of last year ? 
Professor Trelawney was the teacher who taught them the Prophecy at Hogwarts . 
Hermione's frightened face disappeared as soon as she let go of a snorting snort : 
Oh , Harry , do you care about the old lady's words ? 
Harry said : 
You were not there at that time . 
You do not hear the neck . 
I told him , at that time the neck said differently , the neck up - real copper . 
And it is said that the Dark Lord will once again be greater and more terrible than ever , and he does so because the supporters return to support him that night as the tail of the tiger escapes . . 
A complete silence enveloped them as Ron struggled unconsciously around the hole in his bedclothes . 
Hermione asked : 
Why did you ask Hedwig about Harry ? 
Are you expecting a letter ? 
Harry shrugged . 
I told Sirius about the scar suddenly ached . 
I'm waiting for his reply . 
Ron's expression cleared , he said : 
Thinking wisely ! 
Fish Sirius would know what to do . 
Harry said : 
I hope he soon reply to me . 
Hermione said deliberately : 
But we do not know where Sirius is now ? He may be in Africa or somewhere far away , right ? 
Where can Hedwig cross that path for a few days ? 
Harry felt heavy as he looked at the search window in Hedwig's distinctive sky . 
It says : 
Oh , I know . 
Said Ron : 
Harry , we went to the Quidditch yard . Go away , please . 
All three : Bill , Charlie , George and Fred will be playing together , you can try to play Wronski 
Hermione said in a voice I - not - you - you - lack - sensitive : 
Ron ! 
At this time Harry does not want to play Quidditch at all . He's anxious , tired . We need to go to rest . 
But Harry suddenly said , 
Oh , I want to play Quidditch . 
Wait a minute , I went to get the lightning bolt . 
Hermione walked out of the room , mumbling something that sounded like a son ! 
* *

During the following week , neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home . 
They both left the house very early , before the rest of the family woke up , and only returned home after a long dinner each night . 
On Saturday night before the kids returned to Hogwarts , Percy told the boys : 
Absolute chaos 
This week he had to put out fire . 
People are sent to Thunder , and of course the letter will explode if people do not open the Thunder immediately . 
Everywhere his desk was full of burn marks , and his goose feather was turned into a piece of burning coal . 
Ginny was sitting on the carpet in front of the fireplace in the living room , wrapping her book A Thousand Herbs and Mold with Spell - Turtle . 
She asked : 
But why did they send Thunder ? 
Percy said : 
They complained about security in the World Cup . 
They claim compensation for their damaged property . 
Mundungus Fletcher has filed for compensation for a twelve - bedroom tent with a sprinkler , but he knows his plans . 
He knew he was sleeping under a jacket on the sticks . 
Mrs. Weasley glanced at the old clock in the corner . 
Harry enjoyed the clock so much . 
If you want to watch this clock is completely useless , but on the contrary it provides much information . 
It has nine needles , and each needle carries the name of a member of the Weasley family . 
On the watch face there is no number , but there is a note of the place where each member of the family is present . The home , school , or workplace is listed on it , and also strayed , hospitalized , in jail , and in the place where the ordinary meter is 12 , the watch records the risk of death . . 
At present , eight needles are pointing at the word House , but Mr Weasley's needle , the longest tree , still points to the word Do . 
Mrs. Weasley sighed : 
From the time of You - who - also - know - it , your father is not enough to work overtime on weekends . 
They now torture the three children to work too hard . His dinner is about to arrive and if he does not come home soon . 
Percy said : 
No , I feel you must correct my mistake at the World Cup . 
To tell the truth , the three little girls talked in public without consulting their heads first 
Mrs. Weasley scowled . 
Do not blame me for what the evil Skeeter wrote ! 
Bill playing chess with Ron , said : 
If you do not say anything , Rita will also write it as shameful that no one of the Ministry of Magic gives any comment . 
Rita Skeeter never wrote about anyone for a bit of kindness . 
Do you remember that , once she interviewed all the agents except the spell of Gringotts Bank , she called him a long hair robbery ? 
Mrs. Weasley said softly , 
Oh , she also found it a little long , dear . 
If you let the cheeks 
no , mama ! 
The rain was knocking on the living room window . 
Hermione is drunk to read the Book of Basic Quaternary Book 4 . 
Mrs. Weasley bought Harry , Ron and Hermione the textbooks at Cross Lane . 
Charlie was wearing a hooded hat . 
Harry brushed off his lightning bolt , and at his feet opened the guard bracelet that Hermione had donated on her thirteenth birthday . 
Fred and George sat in the far corner , writing goose feathers , talking to each other , clawing on a parchment . 
Mrs. Weasley looked up at her twin sons , her voice clear : 
What are your two children doing ? 
Fred answered absently . 
Exercise . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
Do not be funny . 
You can not draw a new order anymore , do you ? 
And you think about re - opening the Weasley sorcerers ' chapters ? 
Fred looked up at his mother , his face revealing the hurt : 
Oh , if the risk that the Hogwarts expedition will crash tomorrow , George and I die , how will your cheeks feel when you know that the last word we heard was an unfounded accusation ? 
Everyone burst into laughter , even Mrs. Weasley laughed . 
Suddenly she exclaimed as she looked up at the watch again : 
Ah , three children are coming home ! 
The watchmaker's name , Mr. Weasley , suddenly jumped from the Department of Transportation ; and just a second later it shook one and stopped at the House with the other needle , and everyone heard his call from the kitchen : 
I'm coming , Arthur . 
She answered her husband and hurried out of the room . 
Just a moment later , Mr. Weasley entered the cozy main room , holding his dinner plate . 
He looked completely exhausted . 
As he sat down on the couch near the fireplace and swatted his fork with dagger , Mr. Weasley said to Mrs. Weasley , 
Well , now that the oil is really poured into the fire . 
Rita Skeeter has been hunting for news in the Ministry of Magical Arts for a week now , trying to get more out of the mess to make the report . 
And now she has discovered that Bertha's old woman has disappeared , so that tomorrow's Prophet Tomorrow will probably run the headline on the disappearance . 
He had told Bagman long ago that he should have gone to find her . 
Percy said quickly : 
Mr. Crouch said that from week to week . 
Mr. Weasley snapped : 
Thankfully for Crouch , Miss Rita was not aware of Winky . 
The story of his eldest son was caught in the wand holding the wand to call the Black Sign also enough on the front page for a week without joking ? 
Percy said impatiently : 
I thought we all agreed that the elf did not call on the black sign ! 
It is absolutely not responsible at all ! ' 
Hermione interrupted : 
If you allow me to say , I would say that it is very fortunate for Mr. Crouch to have no one in the Daily Prophet know how harsh he is with his elves . 
Percy said : 
Hermione , listen to it ! 
A high - ranking official in the Ministry of Magic as Crouch deserves to be loyal to his servant 
Hermione's voice grows strong : 
You must say your slave ! 
Because he does not pay Winky ! 
Mrs Weasley ended the debate by saying : 
It is better to go upstairs to see your belongings have been sorted out is not finished yet ! 
All right , all right 
Harry collects his broomstick maintenance kit , carrying a Thunderbolt on his shoulder , and Ron climbs up the stairs . 
The sound of the rain blowing down the roof is even louder , the screams of the winds accompanying the scream , it is not to say the howl to explain the wind of ghosts living in the roof attic roof . 
When Ron and Harry went into the room , the Pigwidgeon began to fidget over his pants . 
The litter box and the unfinished furniture would have excited the little eagle eagerly . 
Ron tossed a candy to Harry : 
Give it some sweets . 
May make it go away . 
Harry stuffed the Candy Candy through the bars of Pigwidgeon's cage , then returned to his chest . 
Hedwig's cage was placed right next to the empty chest . 
Harry looked at the tree branch for the bird in the stall : 
It's been over a week , Ron , do you think Sirius could be caught again ? 
Said Ron : 
Are not ! 
If so , then have the full post on the Prophet . 
The Ministry of Magic really wants to show that they have caught somebody , right ? 
Oh , maybe 
Look , this is the cheeks bought for you in the alley . 
And she also took some gold from the coffin to the bridegroom and washed her socks off ! 
Ron picked up a stack of boxes on Harry's bed , and dropped a purse with a pile of socks down next to Harry , who began to unpack the items that had been bought . 
In addition to the basic level 4 charm book , Miranda Goshawk , Harry also has a handful of brand new goose feathers , a dozen rolls of parchment , and accessories for the poison - made ingredients - it has lost lion fish bone sperm and the essence of Datura . 
Harry was wearing underwear with a cauldron , and Ron uttered a disgusting noise behind him : 
What is this thing ? 
Ron was holding something up and Harry saw it like a long velvet dress . 
The collar was tattered and tattered , and the collar was laced with a lace collar . 
There was a knock on the door and Mrs. Weasley came in , holding a Hogwarts uniform in her hand that had just been cleaned . 
She divided the hug that into two heaps : 
Of you here . 
Now the animals are arranged so that they are not wrinkled . 
Ron raised the lace dress for Mrs. Weasley and said , 
Mummy , give me the wrong baby Ginny's shirt . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
Of course not . 
That dress . 
Shouted Ron , 
What ? 
Ms . Weasley repeated : 
Vestments ! 
In the new year's list of items for the new school year , you will be required to wear a formal dress code . 
Ron seemed unbelievable : 
Guess my mother said to play ! 
I do not care about this stuff , no way . 
Madam Weasley : 
Everyone wears that , Ron ! 
The uniform is the same . 
Your father also has some sets for the solemn parties . 
Ron was still stubborn : 
I would rather be naked , but no life busy . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
do not be foolish 
You will have to wear a dress , on a list of dress code . 
I bought some sets for Harry . 
Harry , give it a go 
Harry opened the last package on his bed in distress . 
But not as bad as he thought ; Its dress does not have any rua rua - rather the coat is the same as the slacks he wears to school , only the blue color is not black than tan . 
Mrs. Weasley said cheerfully : 
I think this color highlights the color of your eyes . 
Ron looked at Harry's shirt , angrily said : 
Oh , that looks good ! 
Why do not you buy the same kit ? 
Mrs. Weasley blushed : 
Because the cheek to choose the goods and then buy it for children , so can not choose as it is ! 
Harry turned away . 
It always wanted to share the gold it had in its coffers at Gringotts Bank with the Weasley family , but it knew they would never receive . 
Ron said stubbornly : 
I'm not busy with that . 
No way ! 
Mrs Weasley said : 
okay ! 
Let's go and get naked ! 
And , Harry , I remember taking a picture of him naked . 
Heaven knows , he will laugh abdominal tummy always . 
Mrs. Weasley came out of the room , closing the door behind her . Behind Ron's and Harry's back was a laugh . 
It was Pigwidgeon who was eating an oversized candy . 
Ron walked across the room to Pigwidgeon's cage to take out his beak , angrily exclaiming : 
Why is everything that I get is what people throw away ? 
Chapter 11 On the Hogwarts Express 
When Harry woke up early the next morning , the air carried a distinctly dark look of the day - off - the - end . 
The rain was still heavy , raining outside the window , Harry was wearing jeans and under his T - shirt . 
When they board the Hogwarts , they change their school uniforms . 
Harry , Ron , Fred , and George went down to the breakfast kitchen , but just down the first floor , Mrs. Weasley appeared at the bottom of the stairs , looking confused . 
She called up the floor : 
Arthur Arthur ! 
Arthur Arthur ! 
There is the emergency of the Ministry of Magic ! 
Harry pressed against the wall as Mr. Weasley ran across it to descend the stairs , the robes worn backwards in front , and he shoved one against the other before running away . 
Harry and the others came to the kitchen , and they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging through the drawers : 
I have some goose feathers to do . 
Meanwhile , Mr. Weasley leaned over the fire , talking to him 
Harry closed his eyes and then opened again to make sure his nose was still functioning properly . 
Between the flames of fire is the head of Mr. Amos Diggory , looks like a giant bearded egg . 
The head spoke very quickly , but completely woken up between the flames and licked around the ear . 
The Muggles lived in the neighborhood heard loud explosions and screams , so they ran to call the people he called the port . 
Arthur Arthur , you must go there right now 
Mrs. Weasley was holding her breath , squeezing Mr. Weasley a parchment , a blunt goose and a squid . 
here he 
Diggory's head continued to say , 
I heard this was a surprise . 
I was too early to send some owls , so I discovered a whole bunch of Misuse of Magic if Rita got this news , Arthur 
Mr. Weasley twisted the lid of the ink bottle , squeezed the ink , then said , 
What's wrong with your eyes ? 
Diggory head reversed his eyes : 
Said he had a home intruder in his yard . He said he crawled toward the house , but he was ambushed by garbage cans . 
Mr. Weasley said as he looked at the goose and asked , 
What do the bins do ? 
Mr Diggory said : 
Fucking like hell and burning junk all over , as far as I know . 
When the porters arrived , it was clear that one of the trash was still burning fireworks . 
Mr. Weasley moaned . 
What about the intruder ? 
The head of Mr. Diggory rolled his eyes again . 
Brother Arthur , you know Eyes - crazy . 
Who dared to crawl in the middle of the night late night hả ? 
It seems that there is a scary cat wandering somewhere , or hiding in the potato shells . 
But if the Eye - crazy fall in the wrong hands to use Wrong Magic will be miserable - I think of his profile - We have to remove him , pushed through his office , put down in the trash bunker burst what is the crime ? 
May be warned . 
Mr. Weasley writes so fast , his brows frown : 
Eye - crazy not to use his wand , right ? Is he really not attacking anyone ? 
I bet he jumped out of bed and started messing everything up to reach the window . 
But they will verify that , no casualties at all . 
Okay , I'm leaving 
Mr. Weasley put the parchment in his pocket and threw himself out of the kitchen . 
The head of Diggory looked around and saw Mrs. Weasley : 
Sorry Molly . 
Bother me so early and apologize to me for everything . 
But only Arthur alone can run for Eyes - crazy , and today is the day that Crazy Eyes - should start his new job . 
Why did he choose the right yesterday ? 
Ms . Weasley said : 
do not mind me Amos 
Really do not you want to eat a piece of toast or something before you go ? 
Mr Diggory said : 
Stay , that's right . 
Mrs. Weasley took a piece of toast from the bread basket on the kitchen table , sandwiched it between the pair of flames and fed it to Diggory . 
With a mouth full of bread , Mr. Diggory said , 
Thank you . 
And then just blurted out that he had disappeared . 
Harry could hear Mr. Weasley hurrying to say goodbye to Bill , Charlie , Percy and the two little girls . 
Within five minutes , Mr. Weasley returned to the kitchen , his robes now worn neatly , but his head was still in the comb of hair . 
Mr. Weasley told Harry , Ron and his twin sons : 
Daddy is having a good job with a good semester . 
Tightening his jacket over his shoulder , Mr. Weasley prepares to litter . 
Molly , you alone bring the children to the King Cross ? 
Ms . Weasley said : 
Of course you will . 
You just have to worry about Crazy - Eyes , we will be fine . 
Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen , Mr. Weasley was gone . 
Bill asked : 
Who mentioned the eyes - crazy ? 
What was he meeting ? 
Ms . Weasley said : 
He said someone had attempted to break into his house last night . 
George scooped up the jam on his toast and said , 
Is Moody Eyes - crazy no ? 
Is that crazy ? 
Mrs. Weasley was serious : 
My dad paid close attention to Moody Eyes - crazy . 
When Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen . 
Fred said softly : 
Yeah , right , three collectors of plugs , right ? 
So is the boat council 
Bill said : 
Moody was a great wizard in his day . 
Charlie continued : 
He is an old friend of Dumbledore , right ? 
Fred commented : 
Dumbledore's friend can not be the kind of person he thinks is normal , right ? I mean genius and everything 
Harry asked : 
Eyes - who is crazy ? 
Charlie said : 
Previously he worked at the Ministry of Magic , now retired . 
He met him once when he led his careless father . 
He is a Light God who is one of the most brilliant of all Black Magicians . 
In front of Harry's bewildered face , Charlie added : 
Half of the Azkaban prison is filled with his work . 
However , he also caused a large number of enemies , mostly the families of those arrested by him , and he heard that when he was old he became suspicious . 
He no longer believes in anyone . 
The dark sorcerer is everywhere . 
Bill and Charlie decided to take people to the King Cross station , but Percy apologized that he really needed to work . 
I said : 
At this point I can not look at any time . 
Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me . 
George said solemnly : 
Well , do you know anything , Percy ? 
I guess he will not be his name anymore ! 
Mrs Weasley made a public call in the village to call three Muggle regular taxis to take the children to London . 
When they were standing in a clean , dusty yard , watching the taxi drivers pick up six heavy Hogwarts chests in the car , Mrs. Weasley said to Harry : Uncle Arthur has tried to borrow the Magician's car to take us away . There are no cars at all , Cha , they are not happy , right ? 
Harry did not like to tell Mrs. Weasley that the Muggle taxi driver never carried too much excitement , but the Pigwidgeon was huddled with deafness . 
There was no way to make the Fiery Flames , wet , throbbing , flushed out of Fred's chest as Fred's chest burst open , causing the driver to carry the chest screaming in horror . , and the pain of Crookshanks clawed his legs . 
The journey is not comfortable at all , because they have to be packed in the back seat with trunks . 
Crookshanks had to recover from the fire , and when they arrived in London , Harry , Ron and Hermione were all scratched by the cat . 
Everyone was relieved to arrive at the King Cross Station , although the rain was still heavier than ever before , and everyone was wet as mice unloaded as they carried the chests across the busy street . Vehicles to enter the station . 
Now Harry was familiar with entering the Nine Three - Four station . 
Just a simple matter of step straight through a fence between the Ninth Station and Ten Mile Station . 
The most insidious part of this is how to get to the platform in a private way to avoid the Muggle . 
Today , the children go to the platform in groups ; Harry , Ron , and Hermione are the most exposed because of the accompanying Pigwidgeon cats Crookshanks , which should go first . 
They stood on the fence as usual , spoke innocently , and gently slid through the barricades . And as they passed , the nine - fourths of the platform appeared in front of them . it . 
The Hogwarts Express train , a shining purple train , was lying on the platform , rolling up the steam from the engine , and in the steam , the students and parents Hogwarts looks like black ghosts . 
The Pigwidgeon was ever louder than it ever was when he responded to the murmur of countless owls in the smog . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione boarded the ship , and soon they packed their bulky luggage in a carriage in the middle of the train . 
Finished , they jumped down the platform to break up with Mrs. Weasley , Bill and Charlie . 
Charlie kisses her bestby little sister Ginny just grinned , said : 
You may see them again sooner than you think . 
Fred asked eagerly . 
What happened ? 
Charlie said : 
You will know . 
As long as you do not tell Percy that you're going to talk about it , after all , that's the news of the ' secret ' , until the Ministry of Magic finds the right time to ' disclose ' it . 
Bill looked at the train , two hands folded his pants , he said : 
Oh , I also wish to return to Hogwarts this year . 
George impatiently : 
Why not ? 
Bill's eyes flashed : 
They will have a very interesting year . 
Maybe he will take a break to see a little 
Asked Ron : 
A little something ? 
But at that moment , the train whistle sounded , and Mrs. Weasley urged the children to go to the door to board the train . 
As they climbed the carriage , shut the door , and leaned over the window to talk to Mrs. Weasley . Hermione said , 
Uncle Weasley , we thank you for letting us spend our summer holidays at your house . 
Harry also said : 
Yes , we thank you for everything , Uncle Weasley . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
Oh , that's my happiness , honey . 
I would also like to invite you to play for Christmas , but I guess all of you will want to stay at Hogwarts for one reason or another . 
Angry Ron : 
Mama ! 
Do you know something that we do not know ? 
Mrs. Weasley smiled : 
I hope you will know this evening . 
This is interesting . Tell the children , I'm glad they changed the rules 
Harry , Ron , Fred and George all say , 
What rules ? 
Did you know that Professor Dumbledore will tell you that now he is behaving righteously ? 
Listen , Fred ? 
And you , George ? 
The pistons screeched and the convoy began to pacify . 
And though Mrs Weasley , Bill and Charlie were being rushed away by the train , Fred stuck his head out the window , 
Tell us what happened to Hogwarts ? 
What laws have they changed ? 
But Mrs. Weasley just waved and waved . 
And before the train was hidden in the bend , Mrs. Weasley , Bill and Charlie were invisible . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione went to their own cabin . 
A thick rain splashed against the glass of the car , making it impossible to see anything outside the window . 
Ron opened his chest , took out the hazelnut tuxedo , and threw it on Pigwidgeon's cage to stop the loud snuffling of it . 
He sat down next to Harry and grunted : 
Mr. Bagman was about to tell us what was going to happen at Hogwarts , in the World Quidditch Cup , remember ? But my mother refused to say . 
Do not know what is 
Shit ! 
Suddenly Hermione whispered , pressing one of her fingers to her lips and pointing to the cabin next to their chamber . 
Harry and Ron listened , and they heard a familiar plastic squeaky sound through the door to open . 
My dad actually sent me to study at Durmstrang , not Hogwarts , we knew that . 
I know the principal , we see ? That's right , we know the opinions of my father 
Dumbledore - he was a claw - blooded man - Durmstrang did not pick up the folks . 
But my mother did not like me to go to school so far . 
My brother says that Durmstrang has a more reasonable guideline than Hogwarts School of Dark Arts . 
Durmstrang students study the subject really , not just three classes of rubbish as we learn in Hogwarts 
Hermione stood up , his heels reaching the chamber door , gently pulling the door shut , blocking Malfoy's voice again : 
The angry girl said , 
So is it that Durmstrang is better suited to it ? 
I pray for him to go to school at that time , so that we do not have to endure it . 
Harry asked : 
Durmstrang is another witch training school ? 
Said Hermione , looking slightly contemptuous : 
Ừ . 
The school was scandalous . 
According to A Look at Magical Education in Europe , that school focuses more on Dark Arts . 
Ron asked : 
I remember hearing about it . 
Where is it ? In which country ? 
Hermione raised her eyebrows and said , 
Well , no one knows . 
Harry asked : 
Why do not you know ? 
Hermione explains the fact that : 
Among all the magical schools , there is a traditional antithesis . 
Durmstrang School and Beauxbaton School are hidden away from the school so that no one can steal their secrets . 
Ron started laughing . 
Stop it ! 
Durmstrang must be about the same size as Hogwarts , not a little , how can you hide a castle ? 
Hermione said , 
Is his Hogwarts school also hidden ? 
Everyone knows that Well , anyone who read Hogwarts , A History will know . 
Said Ron : 
Then you're the only one to know But keep on going How can they hide a castle like Hogwarts ? 
Hermione said : 
It was spellbound . For a Muggle to look at only a mosaic ruined building with a panel hanging on the gateway record : DANGER ! NOT SAFE ! 
Then to everyone outside Durmstrang looks like a ruined building only ? 
Hermione shrugged . 
May ! 
Or maybe it was muggle like Muggle World Cup stadium . 
And for foreign wizards and witches not to find it , they will make it impossible - to - map . 
Say it again ! 
Well , one can conjure up a building that makes it impossible to draw it on the map , do you understand ? 
Harry said : 
Oh , if you said so . 
Said Hermione thoughtfully . 
But I think Durmstrang is somewhere far north , somewhere very cold , because part of the school uniforms are fur coats . 
Said Ron dreamily : 
Well , let's think of possible candidates . 
It was easy to push Malfoy out of the ice and make it as if it were an accident . 
The rain is heavier and heavier as the train rushes north . 
The sky was so dark and the window was so dim that I had to light the lantern in the middle of the day . 
The trolley for lunch began to tinkle along the corridor , and Harry bought a bag of cauldron for all three of them to eat . 
From noon to late afternoon , many of their friends stop by , such as Seamus Finnigan , Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom , an extremely absent - minded , round - faced boy , living with a grandmother terrible water . 
Seamus still wore Irish Republican blazer , but now some of the magic effects of the bow are gone . 
It still squeals : Troy ! - Mullet ! - Moran ! but in a sloppy voice and with a kind of exhaustion . 
After about half an hour or so , Hermione was bored of an endless conversation about Quidditch , again burying herself in the Grade 4 Charms book , and began trying to learn a Triệu - practice . 
Neville listens to other people's jealousy as they relive the World Cup . 
It says miserably : 
She did not want to go . 
Will not buy tickets . 
Although it sounds very attractive . 
Said Ron : 
Exciting Neville , look here 
He searched his chest in the luggage compartment and took out the tiny statue of Viktor Krum . 
When Ron put the picture on Neville's chubby hand , he exclaimed envy : 
Oh , too much ? 
Said Ron : 
We also see the fly directly in front of the page . 
We sit in the Hall of Honor 
For the first time in my life and also the last time in my life , Weasley ! 
On the threshold appeared Draco Malfoy . Behind it was Crabbe and Goyle , the two of them measuring their bumps , over a summer that looked like they had grown at least three inches . 
Apparently they overheard the conversation through the door to open , as Dean and Seamus entered . 
Harry said coldly : 
Do not you invite me to join in with you , Malfoy ? 
Malfoy asked Pigwidgeon , 
Weasley something ? One of Ron's sleeveless robes was swaying to the swaying rhythm of the ship , the dangling lace sleeves were easy to see . 
Ron wanted to put the suit over his head , but Malfoy was too quick to catch his fist . 
He held up Ron's formal dress for Crabbe and Goyle , saying in a loud voice : 
Watch this ! 
Weasley ! 
Are you in the middle of this thing ? 
I found this set very modest - black fashion in 1890 
Ron tugged at the shirt from Malfoy's hand , his face becoming the same color as the suit . 
You eat Malfoy ! 
Malfoy screamed at a mocking laugh ; Crabbe and Goyle chuckled and laughed in a stupid way . 
So is not it , Weasley ? 
Try a little glory for your family ? 
There is also a little bit more money , you know that Knowing you win will get some more cool robes . 
Ron ; 
What are you talking about ? 
Malfoy repeats : 
So you are not ? 
Do you think you will , Potter ? 
Have you ever missed any chance to play ? 
Hermione lifted her eyes from the fourth - grade Charms book to hug Malfoy : 
Explain what you mean , or else quit , Malfoy ! 
A grinning smile on Malfoy's pale face . 
She said happily : 
Do not pretend to tell me you do not know . 
Do you have a father and a brother who works in the Ministry of Magic and you do not know ? 
Damn , my dad told me from the brain when he heard that Cornelius Fudge himself said it . 
But my daddy is always on the wing with high - ranking officials in the Ministry of Magic . Maybe you're just a sheriff , so it's not known , Weasley , well , maybe they're not talking about the important issue in front of you 
Breaking out a short laugh , Malfoy signaled to Crabbe and Goyle , and the three left . 
Ron stood up and closed the door of his cabin so strong that the glass was shattered . 
Hermione rebukes : 
Ron ! 
And she withdrew her wand , and said , 
Reparo ! ( Meaning : Repair ! ) 
The glass door ragged to a plate and fly upward attached to the door frame . 
Ron grumbled : 
Let's do it as if we know everything we do not know what's going on . My daddy is always with the high officials at the Ministry of Magic . He can also advance his career at any time . He just likes to do his job 
Hermione quietly said : 
Of course he likes it . 
Do not let Malfoy take your nose , Ron . 
Is it ? 
Catching your nose , huh ? 
It's easy ! 
Ron picked up one of the remaining cauldrons , squeezing it into a dough . 
Ron's irritation extended to the end of the journey . 
It did not talk much when they changed into Hogwarts uniforms , and it was still angry when the Hogwarts Speedway finally slowed down to stop at the end station at Hogwarts Station as dark as the button hose . . 
As the train door opened , the rumbling of thunder resounded overhead . 
Hermione wrapped up Crookshanks in her cloak , and Ron put on his tuxedo on Pigwidgeon . 
The three of them got out of the train , their heads bent down , their eyes narrowed to avoid rainwater coming down . 
The rain was heavy and heavy , as if pounding , as cold as the ice was pouring continuously to the top of it . 
With a gigantic figure emerging at the far end of the platform , Harry shouted : 
Hello Hagrid ! 
Elder Hagrid waved and screamed : 
Good , Harry ? 
Try not to drown to meet again at the party ! 
Traditionally , the first - year students went to Hogwarts Castle to sail past the lake with Hagrid . 
Said Hermione enthusiastically . 
Oh , I can not imagine the sailing across the lake in this weather . She shivered as she and others slowly walked along the dark platform . 
Hundreds of chariot horses without horses are waiting for students outside the station . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione and Neville climbed one of those chariots with gratitude . 
The door was closed , and only a moment later , with the wheels rolling , the mud splashed , the carriage wagged its way to Hogwarts Castle . 
Chapter 12 Competition Tam Tam 
the convoy rolled through the gate , was greeted by two rows of boars with wings on both sides of the gate and ran along the wide expanse , eagerly shaking in a gust of wind that quickly turned into a hurricane . 
Based on the windows of the car , Harry could see Hogwarts approaching anytime . 
The shimmering windows of the castle shimmered in the thick rain . 
A light flashed across the sky as their carriage stopped in front of the huge , oak - edged oak door standing above the stone steps . 
The men in front of the convoy were hastily climbing the stone steps and into the castle . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione , and Neville jumped down from their carriage , and rushed up to the rock steps , only to look up when they were safe in the hall lit by the torch , which looks like a vast cavern , with magnificent marble stairs . 
As soon as shaking his head splash rain , Ron exclaimed : 
Wow , if the rain like this , then rain water will overflow . 
I'm soaked in Asia ! 
A big bubble filled with water and the last red was dropped from the ceiling down to Ron's head and blasted off ! 
Wet and cold , Ron staggered past Harry , just as the second water bomb dropped - narrowly hitting Hermione , bursting right next to Harry's feet , pounding a cold water With no shoes and Harry's stockings . 
Everyone around them screamed and started pushing each other in an effort to avoid disaster . 
Harry looked up and saw floating above people's heads at about six meters tall , the Peeves super - demon in the shape of a small man , wearing a flower helmet and wearing an orange butterfly bow . 
Peeves ' grimace and super - smirk face grimaces for concentration as he tries to target again . 
An angry voice shouted : 
PEEVES ! 
Come DOWN NOW , Peeves ! 
Professor McGonagall , Hogwarts vice principal and Gryffindor dormitory professor , rushed out of the hall ; She stood on the damp floor and wrapped her arms around Hermione's neck to keep her balance , helping her slip . 
Oh sorry Granger ! 
Hermione gasped , rubbing her throat : 
Yes , Professor , no problem . 
Professor McGonagall corrected the pointed cap on her head neatly , and then she glared up through the square shuttered eyes and shouted : 
Peeves ! 
Down here IMMEDIATELY ! 
Peeves chuckled , catching a water bomb with a group of five - year - old girls , causing the little girls to squeak in and out of the Hall . 
do not do anything ! 
The Super Evil Peeves stirrings . 
They are already wet and not ready ! 
Just a tiny trickle of water ! 
Xìììì tiììiiiiiii ! 
Finished it another bomb targeting a group of students who had just arrived . 
The professor shouted : 
I warn you , Peeves ! I will invite the President to come here ! 
Peeves stuck out his tongue , threw the last water bomb into the air , then turned around , soared up the marble stairs , laughing hysterically crazy like crazy . 
Professor McGonagall is now back in his wet , 
All right , go ! go to the hall , go ! 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione walked across the lobby and through the double room at the right hand . 
Ron just pulled his wet hair down on his face , cursed angrily . 
The hallway looks as splendid as it used to be , decorated magnificently for the beginning of the school year . 
Gold plates and golden cups shone in the light of hundreds and hundreds of tops hovering in the air above the tables . 
The students were sitting four long tables of four houses , fighting furiously . 
At the top of the hall was the fifth long table , for professors , who just sat at one side of the table , so that they could all face their students . 
In the hall this is much warmer than the lobby . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione walked through the rows of Slytherin students , the Ravenclaws , the Hufflepuff , and sat down with the other Gryffindor students at the other end of the hall . 
They sat next to Gryffindor's ghost , NickSuch - lost - head . 
Thanks to pearl - colored and semi - transparent , Nick - Near - loss - head of the night wearing his usual tunic , but especially wearing a large collared collar , The job was to make a splendid appearance , and to ensure that his head would not be wobbling too much on the neck that had been cut short . 
Mr. Nick - Near to death - smiling head with three Harry , Ron and Hermione : 
Hello children . 
Harry took off his shoe , pouring out his water , saying : 
Who says that ? 
May they categorize swiftly . 
I'm hungry to death . 
The Classification for placement of new students into the House was at the beginning of each school year , but due to the unlucky combination of situations where Harry did not attend another class of his own , since He attended Hogwarts School so far . 
So it was very anxious to see the ceremony . 
At that moment , a voice of calm and excitement called down from the top of the table : 
Hello Harry ! 
It was Colin Creevey , a third year student honoring Harry as an idol . 
Harry waved back : 
Hello Colin ! 
Harry , guess what ? 
Can you guess Harry ? 
My younger brother enrolled there ! 
My Dennis ! 
Harry said : 
Oh well ! 
Colin nearly jumped on the chair , continued : 
It's very exciting ! 
I just hope it will not be Gryffindor ! 
Make a mark for him , Harry ! 
Okay . alright . 
Harry finished talking back to Ron , Hermione and Nick . 
It says : 
Brothers and sisters are often in the same house , right ? 
It is based on the fact that the Weasley family , all seven brothers , were all assigned to the Gryffindor family . 
Hermione said : 
Oh , not necessarily . 
The twins were with Parvati Patil at Ravenclaw's house , although they were exactly the same . 
I thought they would be sharing the house together ? 
Harry looked up at the professor's desk . 
Seems to have more vacant seats than usual . 
Of course , Hagrid's place was empty as he was busy rowing the new soldiers across the lake . 
Professor McGonagall was probably directing the drying of the lobby floor . 
But there was still an empty seat , Harry thought forever , and there was still no one left . 
Hermione looked up at the professor's desk and asked : 
Where is Black Hawk Down ? 
They have never studied with a Black Hawk Preacher for three semesters . 
Up until now , the teacher who taught Harry the most is Lupine , but he resigned at the end of the school year . 
He looked up and looked down at the professor's desk . 
Obviously there are no new faces . 
Hermione was worried : 
Can not we find someone who teaches us ? 
Harry glared at each of them on the professor's desk . 
This is a tiny dwarf , Flitwick Professor , who is sitting on a heap of milky couches , right next to Professor Sprout , teaching herbal medicine , wearing a hollow helmet on his gray hair . 
The professor is talking to Professor Sinistra of the Department of Astronomy . 
Next to Professor Sinistra is the golden face , the snappy nose , the shaggy hair of the master of poison is Professor Snape - the teacher that Harry found the most difficult at Hogwarts this school . 
Harry's dissatisfaction with Snape can only be compared to that of Snape's hatred for him . 
That hatred , if possible , had risen to the end of the previous school year , at which time Harry helped Sirius escape under the oversized nose of Snape . 
Snape and Sirius have been enemies since they were schoolmates . 
Next to Snape was an empty chair that Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall's chair . 
Sitting next to that chair , in the middle of the table , was Professor Dumbledore , the headmaster , with long hair and beard trimmed in turquoise beards . 
The green chiffon blouse of the embroidery is embroidered many moon stars . 
Long , thin fingers touched each other to support his chin . 
And he sat there , staring at the ceiling through his half - moon - shaped eyes , as if he was meditating . 
Harry also glanced at the ceiling as he did . 
The ceiling was spellbound for exactly the same sky , and never before had Harry seen the great hall of the storm . 
Dark and dark clouds swirled through the ceiling , and a string of thunderstorms broke out of the sky , and a lightning flashed through the ceiling of the hall . 
Sitting next to Harry , Ron groaned : 
Hurry up . 
I'm so hungry to eat a cod liver . 
He just finished , the door of the hallway opened and all was silent . 
Professor McGonagall is leading a long line of newcomers to the front of the hall . 
Although Harry , Ron and Hermione are wet , but compared to these new children are not so damned . 
They look like they both swim through the lake rather than sailing across the lake . 
The cold and the tension made all of the kids tremble as they lined up in front of the professor's desk and stood in a row facing the whole school . 
All of them were trembling , except for one of the smallest of the bunch , a boy with a hair that looked like a rat . 
The kid curled up in what Harry recognized as Hagrid's moleskin . 
The jacket was so oversized that its tiny body made it appear to be wrapped in a dark , furry dark tent . 
His tiny face peeked out of the huge jacket collar , almost nervously suspicious . 
As she lined up with her crooked peers , caught sight of Colin Creevey , who raised his finger and whispered , " I'm falling into a lake ! " He seems happy about it . 
Professor McGonagall now placed a three - legged stool on the floor of the hall , in front of the first - year students , and on that chair was a wicked hatter and patch , extremely old and dusty . . First year students stared at the hat . 
Everyone is staring like that . 
A moment later , still completely silent , suddenly a tear near the cone opened like a mouth , and the hat sang : 
A thousand years ago or more , 
When I was just sewed 
There are four famous sorcerers famous Until now still know the name : Gryffindor brave land , 
Ravenclaw fair valley narrow , 
Sweet valley wide Hufflepuff , 
Slytherin shrews of swamp . 
They have the same ambition , one hope , one dream 
They cherish a bold scheme : 
train young witches 
And Hogwarts School was born . 
Every single founder 
There is a separate school 
Each school respects a different virtue 
In the disciples they teach 
For Gryffindor , the bravest 
is superior to all others . 
For Ravenclaw , the cleverest is always the best 
For Hufflepuff is diligent 
New to qualify for admission 
And the Slytherin longed for power 
I love all those who are ambitious 
When they are alive they are selective 
The guys they love the most from the crowd 
But how to choose the most worthy person 
When are they dead ? 
Gryffindor found this way 
He stripped me of his head 
Each founder shoved me a little of their brain 
to which i choose 
Now put me on your head 
I never choose wrong 
I will look in your mind 
And say you belong to the House . 
The hall shakes with a loud applause when the classifier hat is sung . 
Harry clapped hands with everyone , but he said : 
That's not the song that the hat sings when we sort out . 
Said Ron : 
Every year it sings another song . 
How do you make a hat like it ? 
I guess the hat spent the rest of the year to make new songs for next year . 
Professor McGonagall is now opening a great parchment . 
She told the first - year students : 
I call the name of the game when it hats a head and sit on the chair . 
When the hat informs you of the House , you will go to the table of your house and sit there . 
She started calling : 
Ackerley , Stewart 
A little boy stepped forward , seeing it trembling from head to toe . 
It's a sort of cone Sort team up and sit on the chair . 
The hat : 
Ravenclaw ! 
Stewart Ackerley opened her hats and hurried toward her seat at the Ravenclaw's table in the midst of the applause of the Ravenclaws . 
When Stewart Ackerley sat down , Harry met Cho Chang's eyes , the Ravenclaw Quidditch player , and greeted Stewart . 
In a very short moment , Harry had a strange desire to be in the same Ravenclaw table . 
Baddock , Malcolm 
Slytherin ! 
The table on the other side of the hall boomed loudly . 
Harry could see Malfoy cry out when Baddock joins Slytherin . 
Harry wonders if Baddock knows that the Slytherins are making more Dark Wizards than any other house ? Fred and George also whistled Baddock as he sat down at the Slytherin table . 
Branstone , Eleanor 
Hufflepuff ! 
Cauldwell , Owen 
Hufflepuff ! 
Creevey , Dennis 
Little Dennis staggered out , clutching Hagrid's jacket , just as Hagrid himself had just entered the hall through a door behind the professor's desk . 
He was nearly twice as likely to be human , and at least three times as wide as human . 
Hagrid , with long , wild hair and a thick beard , looked a little scary - but that was a false impression , because to Harry , Ron and Hermione , they knew him well . good belly extremely . 
As he sat at the end of the professor's desk , he winked at them and looked at Dennis Creevey with a hat on his head . 
The border around the cone enlarges . 
The hat : 
Gryffindor ! 
Hagrid clapped his hands together with all the Gryffindor members as Dennis grinned , lifted his hat , put it back on his chair , and rushed to the Gryffindor table to meet him . 
He threw himself into an empty chair , squawking : 
Colin , I fell into the lake ! 
Very good ! 
Something in the water grabs you and pushes you back into the boat ! 
Colin was as nervous as he was : 
Great ! 
Must be the giant squid that Dennis ! 
Gosh ! 
Dennis exclaimed , as if no one , even in the most crazy dreams , could dream of anything better than being thrown into a deep lake deep in the stormy rain , then again a monster Giant sea pushed out of the water . 
Dennis ! 
Dennis ! 
Did you see him sitting there ? 
Are you black hair wearing glasses ? 
See you ? 
Who is the picture , Dennis ? 
Harry looked away , beginning to look at the sorting cap sorting to Emma Dobbs . 
Classification continues ; little girls and boys , one by one , wearing different fears on their faces , climbing on a chair . 
When Professor McGonagall passed the L rhyme on her list , the new soldier was short to impatient . 
Ron rubbed his stomach , moaning : 
Oh , come on ! 
Nick - Near - death - said : 
Behold , Ron , classification is more important than eating ! 
At that moment , a baby named Laura Madley was assigned to Hufflepuff . 
Ron chuckled : 
Of course , it is more important than when one is dead . 
Nick - Nearly - lost - cheered as Natalie McDonald joined Gryffindor table . 
I hope the newcomers to the Gryffindor this year will not be so scared . 
We do not want to spoil our red goods , right ? 
Gryffindor has won the Inter - House Championship for three consecutive years . 
Pritchard , Graham ! 
Slytherin 
Quirke , Orla ! 
Ravenclaw 
And finally : 
Whitby , Kevin ! 
Hufflepuff 
The classification is terminated . 
The professor holds back the hat and takes the three - legged chair . 
Ron grabbed the fork and glanced at his gold plate . 
It's over now ! 
Professor Dumbledore stood up . 
Smiling at the students , two arms wide open to welcome them . 
He said , a deep , deep voice in the hall . 
I have only two hours to tell you . 
Weightless ! 
Yes , listen ! 
Harry and Ron said loudly as the plates suddenly filled up with the mysterious food in front of their eyes . 
Nick - Nearly - lost - head looked at Harry with mournful sadness . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione filled their plate with food . 
A mouth full of crushed mashed potatoes made Ron say the words : 
Aaaa ' ã ' Oh ' sicken 
Nick - Nearly - lost his head almost said : 
The ladies you get the party tonight is so lucky , you know ? 
Previously there was a problem in the kitchen . 
Harry said to the steak in his mouth : 
Why so ? 
What happened to you ? 
Nick - Nearly - lost - head shook his head making it sway pretty dangerous : 
Of course , he's a super - pee - guy too ! 
Nick - Nearly - lost - his pulling collar folded a little higher . 
The usual argument , you know . 
The devil wants to party , it's almost impossible , he knows how the devil is like , all the barbarians are always there , just to see what plate of food it is catching the toss . 
We were meeting the Council of Monks and Nuns who wanted to give it a chance - but in my opinion , it was not good to let the Baron bloody hand . 
The bloody baron was the Slytherin ghost , a gloomy , gaunt , gaunt , in the tarnished silver cloth . 
The bloody baron is the only one in Hogwarts who can control Peeves . 
Said Ron in a gloomy voice : 
Oh , we all thought Peeves were messing with something . What did it do in the kitchen ? 
Nick - Near - loss - head shrugged : 
Oh , that's normal . 
Pounding and stirring up the bowl ! 
Pitcher pan and pan pan . 
Swimming in the soup of people . 
Make the elves crazy 
X - ray ! 
Hermione drops her gold cup . 
The pumpkin juice splashed on the tablecloth , oblivious to the orange fabric , but Hermione did not care . 
She looked startled , staring at Nick . 
Is there an elf here ? At this Hogwarts school ? 
Nick - Nearly - lost - head looked at her , very surprised with Hermione's reaction : 
of course yes . 
And I believe they are here in the highest number in England , there are more than a hundred . 
Hermione said : 
I have never seen an elf here . 
Nick - Near - death - said : 
Well , the elves rarely leave the kitchen . 
Only at night did they come up to do some trivial things like cleaning up the furnace and so on . I mean , you girls do not need to see them ? That's the good thing about the elves , that the girls did not realize their existence . 
Hermione stared at Nick . 
She said : 
But are they paid ? 
Can they get a holiday ? 
And sick leave , and superannuation , and other things . 
Nick - Nearly - lost a smile so badly that the collapsed collar was torn and his head dropped , leaving only a flesh or size that attached to the neck . 
He said : 
Stay sick and retire ? 
Nick - Nearly - lost - head pushed his head back on his shoulders and reassembled it with his folded collar . 
Ejaculators do not want to get sick and retire ! 
Hermione looked down at the disheveled food she had not actually touched . 
But she put the knife and fork down and pushed the plate away . 
Said Ron , some pieces of Yorkshire bread accidentally sprayed in Harry's face . 
Oh , that's my head - pillow . 
Oh sorry da home , Harry 
He nibbled on the food in his mouth , telling Hermione , 
Do not you go hungry , they do not get sick ? 
Hermione breathed heavily , her breath puffing out her nostrils . 
She said : 
Slave labor . 
That's what makes this meal . 
Labor slaves ! 
And she definitely did not want to eat a piece of it . 
The rain still pouring water outside , pat on the glass window high and dark black sound like rattling drum . 
Another burst of lightning struck the windows , and the ceiling of the stormy hall filled with lightning bolts , flashed the golden plates with the dishes of the first set and was prepared . Refreshing with the next dish is a dessert . 
Ron deliberately blows the scent of the cake toward Hermione : 
Cake with honey , Hermione . 
Look , sour moon cake , chocolate cake again ! 
But Hermione gave Ron a look that reminded him of Professor McGonagall's eyes , and he stopped provoking her . 
When the cake was gone and the crumbs finally disappeared on the plates that had become clean , Dumbledore stood up again . 
The loud noise of the loud hall suddenly suddenly settles down , and one can only hear the winds and the screams of rain . 
Dumbledore smiled at everyone , saying : 
Oh ! 
Now everyone is eating well ( Hermione Hmmm ) I must immediately notice the focus attention so that I announce something . 
Filch , the school superintendent , asked me to tell the students that the list of prohibited things inside the castle during this school year was supplemented , including Yo - yo Rattling , fangs , and sticks stick nostalgic . 
The full list of banned items is four hundred and thirty - seven , I remember , and can be consulted in the Filch supervisor's office , if there are any games to try . 
Dumbledore's mouth was slightly raised . 
He continued : 
As before , I would like to remind you that all the forests in the property around the school are forbidden to students , and all third - year students are not allowed to go to Hogsmeade . 
I also took the painful task of informing you that this year there was no Quidditch Cup - home match . 
What ? 
Harry gasped . 
He looked over at Fred and George and the other Quidditch team members . 
They muttered something to Dumbledore without uttering a word , obviously staggering to say nothing . 
Dumbledore continues : 
The fact is that the Quidditch Cup will not be held because the event will start in October and last until the end of the school year , which will take time and energy . I am sure that all of you will be very excited to participate . 
I am very pleased to announce that this year at Hogwarts School 
But just in time , a thunderous thunder clanged and the door to the open hall burst open . 
A man stood in the doorway , leaning against a long stick , his body wrapped in a black tunic . 
Every head in the hallway turned to the stranger . 
Suddenly lightning flashed up on the ceiling of the hallway illuminating the stranger . 
He pulled his face covered with a hat , shuddered shaking his head , sprinkling rain water on his gray hair , and began to walk to the professor's desk . 
Every step of the stranger echoed a murmur across the hall . At the end of the long table , turn right , and then trudge to Dumbledore . 
Another flash of light , Hermione gaped in horror . 
In the flash , the man's face looked like a sharp - edged photograph , and it was a strange face that Harry had never seen before . 
It seemed as if it had been engraved on a wooden frosted wood , under the hand of a man who knew so vaguely the so - called personalities , and there was no hint of hiss . 
Each skin is like a scar . 
The mouth looks exactly like a twisted cut , with the tip of the nose tucked away . 
But the new eyes make him look terrible . 
One of the eyes is tiny , dark , and bright . 
The eyes are big , round like a coin , neon blue - he shines . 
Blue eyes are constantly moving . 
Do not blink one , it rolls up , rolls down , from side to side , completely independent of the rest of the eye . 
And when it hits up against the back of his neck , there is only one white . 
The stranger walked towards Dumbledore . 
Y stretched out a hand as well as the same scars as his face . 
Dumbledore caught his hand , muttering something Harry could not hear . 
You seem to be asking this strange character , who nods silently , does not smile , only responds in a very low voice . 
Dumbledore nodded and gave the man a blank spot on his right . 
The stranger sat down , shook his grayed mane off his face , pulled a sausage plate toward him , put it on the rest of the nose , and sniffed . He took a small knife from his pocket , slid into the tail of the sausage , and began to eat . 
His normal eye was fixed on the pieces of the sausage , but the blue eyes were still stuck in the eye socket , swept across the hall to the students . 
Allow me to be introduced , the teacher of Anti - Artistic Defense . 
Dumbledore murmured in the air . 
Professor Moody . 
Often , every teacher should be greeted with applause , but this time there was no teacher , no pupil except Dumbledore and Hagrid . 
The two clapped their hands together , but the clanging sounded mournfully in silence , and the two stopped very quickly . 
Everyone was so stunned by Moody's bizarre look that he did not know what to do but stare at him . 
Harry whispered to Ron : 
Moody ? 
Must Moody Eyes - crazy ? What are you going to do that morning ? 
Said Ron , looking tremulous in his voice : 
I guess so then . 
What happened to him ? Whispered Hermione . What's wrong with him ? 
Do not know , Ron whispered back , eyes still looking at Moody as hypnotized . 
Moody seems completely indifferent to the warm reception for her . 
Ignoring the water pumpkin in front of him , he resumed his lap in his street , pulled out a bottle of wine and pocketed a long sip . 
As he lifted his arm up to drink , his robes sputtered some of the feces off the ground , and Harry saw , under the table , the feces of a wooden leg , with a nail claw 
Dumbledore cleared his throat . 
He said smiling in front of the sea of ​​ students sitting in front , all eyes Moody eyes - crazy do not blink : 
As I would like to say we are honored to receive an amazing event in the coming months , an event that has not taken place for the past century . 
I am delighted to be able to tell you that the Triwizard Tournament will take place at Hogwarts this year . 
THANK YOU , teacher ! Fred Weasley said aloud . 
The tension filled the Hall of Fame since Moody's suddenly ruptured . 
Everyone laughs , and Dumbledore chokes . 
I'm not kidding , Mr. Weasley , however , at the reminder , I remember the very funny summer of a demon , a witch , a goblin , all three went to the pub . 
Professor McGonagall cleared his throat loudly . 
Dumbledore said , 
Oh maybe now is not no time I'm talking about ? 
Well , come to the Magic Trial anyway , some games do not know what this duel has , so I hope the game has known 
I was a little bit confused , and I allowed the attention of the spoilers to wander . 
The Magic Triangle was created about seven hundred years ago as a match between three European Magic Schools : Hogwarts , Beauxbaton , and Durmstrang . 
Each school selects a champion , and the three champion will compete in three magical tests . 
Schools take turns organizing every five years , and at that time , it is generally agreed that this is the best way to establish relationships between males and femens of nations - until the name The book of the murdered man was too high to end the fight . 
Hermione whispered fearfully : 
List of people killed ? 
But her anxiety was unlikely to be felt by most of the students in the hall ; Many are humming excitedly , and Harry himself is happy to hear about the fight , rather than worry about those who died several hundred years ago . 
Professor Dumbledore continued : 
There have been many attempts over the past several centuries to revive the competition , but so far no effort has been made . 
However , the Ministry of International Cooperation with the Ministry of Athletics and Sports has decided that the time was ripe to try again . 
We worked hard throughout the summer to make sure that this time no female or male champion was in danger of death . 
The principals of Beauxbaton and Durmstrang will come here in October , with players entering the final round , and the championship will take place at the Ma ceremony . 
A fair judge will select the most worthy students to attend the trilogy of witches to win glory for the school , pocketed a thousand Galleons bonuses . 
You go ! 
Fred hissed under the table . 
Its face is radiant with the prospect of glory and riches . 
He was not the only one who imagined himself to be a Hogwarts champion . 
At every table in the House , Harry could see the game , or look at Dumbledore , or else he would also be ardently whispering to the kids next door . 
But as Dumbledore went on , the Hall once again im - re : 
Although he knows the children may be the ones who brought the Triple Cup to Hogwarts , but the principals of the schools attended , together with the Ministry of Magic , this year agreed to set the age limit for the opponents . 
Only students of the right age - that is , seventeen or older - are allowed to post for review . here 
Dumbledore's voice was slightly raised , for at that moment some of them made a loud noise when they heard these words , and the Weasley brothers suddenly looked bloody . 
is a measure that we deem necessary , given that the test of the game is difficult and dangerous , no matter how cautious we are , and students under sixth or th Seven are almost impossible to cope with these tests . 
Individual teachers will ensure that not a player under the age of the jury to be judged as a champion Hogwarts . 
His pale blue eyes glinted at the rebellious faces of Fred and George . 
Therefore , I beg you not to waste your registration time if you are under the age of seventeen . 
The Beauxbaton School Delegation and the Durmstrang School will arrive in October and will stay with us for the most part of the year . 
You know that you will give your guests the privilege of staying with us , and once you have chosen the male or female champion of Hogwarts , you will be a great support to the champion . . 
Now , it's late , I want to know the most important thing is tomorrow you have to be calm and calm when you start tomorrow morning lesson . 
Let's sleep ! 
Quick ! 
Professor Dumbledore sat down and spoke to Moody - crazy . 
A screeching sound and trembling as the whole school students shuffled toward the double doors into the hallway . 
They can not do that ! 
Says George Weasley . 
He did not join the crowd with the door , but stood up and glared at Dumbledore . 
This April we are seventeen , why not try one ? 
Frustrated Fred , looking furiously at the long table : 
They will not stop me from naming myself . 
The champion will be doing all sorts of monsters that normally are not allowed . 
There are still a thousand Galleons bonus ! 
Ron said with a distant look : 
Ờ Ờ , to a thousand Galleons cheated 
Cried Hermione : 
Come on , do not go , we're just here . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred and George went out into the lobby . 
Fred and George are arguing about ways Dumbledore can prevent under - 17 s from registering for the tournament . 
Harry asked : 
The judge who decides who is the champion ? 
Fred said , 
Tolerate 
But they must be tricked . 
Drops of poison are aging , George 
Said Ron : 
' Dumbledore knows you are not old yet ! 
Fred sighed : 
Oh , but I'm not the one who decides who is the champion , right ? 
It seems that once he knows who wants to register , he will choose the best one in every school , no matter how old he is . 
Dumbledore was trying to stop us from giving his name . 
Said Hermione , as they passed by the door hidden behind the rug and suddenly opened another narrow staircase : 
Someone died ! 
Fred said indifferently . 
Oh , but for a long time , right ? 
Anyway , do not risk how happy ? 
Hey , Ron , what if we find out how to trick Dumbledore ? 
Do you have a liver to register ? 
Ron asked Harry : 
What do you think ? Is it so delicious ? 
But I think they want to have bigger people than Hong knows we have learned enough 
Certainly not enough . 
Neville's melancholy voice echoed behind Fred and George's back : 
But she also wants to try . 
She always says she has to protect her family's honor . 
I have to do that Oh 
One of Neville's feet sank to a stairway in the middle of the stairs . 
There were so many stairs in this school in Hogwarts , and for the big students , they were so familiar with stepping on this level that Neville's memory was notorious . 
Harry and Ron pulled out their armpits , while the warrior's armor stood on the stairs , creaking and croaking , laughing : 
Shut up ! 
Ron said as he lowered the cover of the armor's eyes as they passed . 
The little ones headed for Gryffindor's entrance , hidden behind Mrs. Bon's portrait in pink silk . 
She asked as they approached : 
Password ? 
Three three . George said , the chief under his new house said good . 
The portrait flickers forward , revealing a hole in the wall for the children to pass . 
A fire flames circulate around the common room , filled with soft chairs and tables . 
And before I could say hi to the bed , I disappeared behind the door leading to the bedroom of the girls , and Hermione threw a dark look into the fire of joy , and Harry heard it murmured : labor . 
Harry , Ron , and Neville climbed to the last spiral staircase until they reached their bedroom , at the bottom of the tower . 
Five beds with piles of mosquito netting with dark red curtains close to the wall , at the bottom of each bed is the chest of the master . 
Dean and Seamus had to sleep in bed : Seamus pinned the Irish rose on the bedside table , and Dean pinned the Viktor Krum poster above his bedside table . 
The old West Ham football poster was pinned to the side . 
Ron sighed , shaking his head at the motionless soccer player . 
Mental ! 
Harry , Ron , and Neville went to sleep in bed . 
Someone - probably an elf - put the warm pan between the blankets . 
It was pleasant , lying in bed listening to the storm raging out there . 
Said Ron sleepily in the dark : 
Maybe I should attend , you know . 
If Fred and George find a way to keep the fight unfamiliar , huh ? 
Probably not 
Harry rolled into the bed . 
A series of bright new images appeared in his mind . It was condemned by the jury to be believed to be seventeen years old . It became Hogwarts , it stood on the ground , winning high in the field . , all clapping loudly and shouting it won the Magic Trilogy competition . 
To stand out among the smudged crowd , her face was reddened by admiration 
Harry grinned in his pillow , delighted even more that Ron did not see what he saw . 
Chapter 13 
The next morning , the storm dissipated , though the hallway was still dark , the gray clouds swirling overhead as Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at the breakfast schedule . 
A few seats away , Fred , George , and Lee Jordan are discussing what kind of magic can make them old enough to trick the Triwizard Tournament . 
Said Ron , pointing his finger at the second schedule : 
It was not bad outside in the morning . 
Herbal with Hufflepuff . 
I have to study with the Slytherins 
Harry whined : 
Two prophecies this afternoon . 
He drops his eyes . 
Prophecy is the subject that it is most difficult to find , besides toxic drugs . 
Professor Trelawney predicted the death of Harry , which made him feel terribly uncomfortable . 
Said Hermione quickly , hands tossed butter over the toast : 
You should have left the subject as yourself . 
Then find the right subjects like arithmetic learning . 
Ron looked at Hermione with a jar of jam , 
I see you eat again ! 
I decided to have better ways to defend the elves . 
Said Hermione arrogantly . 
Ron grinned . 
Yes , and you are hungry . 
Suddenly , there was a rustle above the small man's head , and hundreds of flies flickered through the open window frames , carrying bright letters . 
Instinctively , Harry looked up , but there was no sign of the white shadow between a hungry and gray . 
Striped pants on the table , to find people with letters and parcels sent to . 
A large owl hung down to Neville Longbottom and dropped into his lap a packet - Neville almost always forgot to pack something . On the other side of the Hall , Draco Malfoy's hawk ducked on his shoulder , carrying something that looked like a pack of candy supplies at home . 
Ignoring the hunger for alcohol in his stomach , Harry turned to his oatmeal . 
Or what happened to Hedwig ? 
Or Sirius did not receive the letter ? 
Its anxiety extended all the way through the wet vegetable garden , until they reached the third glasshouse , where it was distracted by Professor Sprout , who was teaching the whole class . The most ugly tree that Harry ever saw . 
Indeed , the plants are not like anything but a giant snail , black , thick , straight from the ground . 
The tree is slightly writhing and grows a large pile of luminescence on the body , as if it is filled with liquid . 
Sprout said hastily : 
U . 
Have to squeeze them . 
You will harvest the pus 
What ? 
Seamus Finnigan cried out in protest . 
Pus , Finnigan , pus . 
Said Professor Sprout . 
And they are extremely precious , so do not waste it . 
The game will harvest latex , to see , put down a few bottles . 
Wear gauntlet gloves , licking thick latex will cause some devil skin . 
Squirting some of the tubers is indeed hideous , but it also seems strange . 
Whenever a lump is smashed , a pile of yellow - green liquid spills out and smells of petroleum . 
The pus was in the pile of bottles that Professor Sprout had pointed out , and at the end of the study they had harvested a few liters . 
Professor Sprout said just closing the last bottle with a leathery button : 
Mrs. Pomfrey will be very happy . 
Latex is a great remedy for treating acne . Can prevent students from having to spend some risky methods to break the acne . 
Hugh Abbott , a Hufflepuff student , said , whispering , 
Like poor Eloise Midgen . 
He tried to curl his pimples . 
Professor Sprout shook his head : 
She is stupid . 
Miss Pomfrey had her nose repaired . 
A bell rang from the direction of the castle , passing through the wetlands , signaling the school was over , and the school spread out ; The Hufflepuffs climbed the stone steps to the Turnstile ; while Gryffindor heads in another direction , down the slope , down Hagrid's wooden hut at the edge of the Forbidden Forest . 
Hagrid stood outside the hut , holding one of the giant black hound's necklaces - Fang . 
At his feet , lying on the ground , were many wooden crates , and Fang groaned , struggling in his neck tie , seemingly looking intently to look inside the barrel . 
As they drew near , a strange whirring sound struck the ear , cushioned by sounds like a few small blasts . 
Hagrid grinned at Harry , Ron and Hermione : 
Hello ! 
Now wait for the Slytherins here , they do not want to miss this one ! - Tailed Shrike ! 
Shouted Ron : 
What do you say ? 
Harry pointed at the wooden crates . 
Lavender shouted , jumping back . 
Sweet ! 
It is enough to summarize all of Harry's feelings about the Tailed Shrike . 
They look like unshelled lobsters , deformed , pale and muddy , with their legs out of bizarre places and invisible heads . 
There were about a hundred in each box , each one about fifteen inches long , crawling over each other , flipping over the sides of the barrel . 
They stink of fluffiness . 
From time to time , a few sparks emerge from the tail of a monster , and with a small ' squeeze ' , the creature shoots himself up to a dozen feces . 
Said Hagrid proudly : 
It's hatched . 
They can feed themselves . 
But also prepare a bit . 
What do we want to feed them ? 
A cold voice lifted . 
The Slytherins arrived , and the speaker was Draco Malfoy . 
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled at each other's words . 
Hagrid looked hard at the question . 
Malfoy continued : 
I mean , what do they do ? What does that mean ? 
Hagrid opened his mouth , thinking hard . 
Pause for a few seconds , and then he says gingerly : 
That's for the next post , Malfoy . 
Let's eat them now . 
Now , the game will give them a different try . 
I have never breed , not sure what they like . There are a few eggs , liver frogs , some snakes try to give them a little bit . 
First is pus , now this . Seamus grumbled . 
Nothing but Hagrid's deep affection led Harry , Ron , and Hermione to pick up a few fistfuls of liver frogs , throwing them in the bin to lure Clownfish . 
Harry can not help wondering that all these gestures are meaningless , because the monsters do not seem to have a mouth . 
After about ten minutes , Dean Thomas cried out : 
Drink it ! 
It bites me ! 
Hagrid rushed back , looking worried . 
Dean said in an angry voice , pointing to Hagrid's hand as he saw the burn on his hand : 
its tail burst ! 
Hagrid nodded . 
Oh , yeah , this happens every time they explode . 
Lavender exclaimed again : 
E ! 
Uncle Hagrid , what is sharp on him ? 
Said Hagrid , warmly : 
Well , some have tentacles . 
( Lavender immediately jumps out of the cage . ) 
Uncle think they are the males . Some children have the suction cup on the belly Uncle think they are blood sucking . 
Malfoy said sarcastically : 
Well , I know for sure why people try to keep them alive . 
Who does not like to raise children to burn , bite , know how to prick ! 
Hermione immediately : 
Not because they are not beautiful but they say they are useless ! 
Blood Dragon , That magic magic , which you do not want to raise dragons do not play , right ? 
Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid , and he laughed under his beard . 
It was as if Harry , Ron and Hermione were all too familiar , Hagrid was no better than a little dragon - he had owned a child for a brief period of time in his first year , a Norwegian - type dragon The name is Nobert . 
Mr. Hagrid simply loved monsters , the more deadly the better . 
Good , at least some little monsters . 
Ron said as they headed for the castle for lunch an hour later . 
Exasperated Hermione : 
Now , but when Hagrid found out what they were eating , I thought they had to be two feet long . 
Ron smiled wryly at Hermione , saying : 
Oh , but what if they turned out to cure a seasickness or something , right ? 
Hermione was slightly annoyed : 
You know that I say so just to let Malfoy shut up ! 
Actually I think that guy is right . 
Perhaps the best thing to do is to hold all of them before they hit us all . 
They sat down on Gryffindor's table and cups of lamb chops with potatoes . 
Hermione so fast that Harry and Ron had to stare at him . 
Shouted Ron : 
Eh , this is called ejaculatory disease ? 
Instead , watch out for you now . 
Hermione replied earnestly , filling a mouth full of money . 
No , I just want to go to the library immediately . 
Shouted Ron , incredulous : 
What ? 
Hermione , today went back to school today . 
We do not have homework yet ! 
Hermione shrugged and continued eating food , as if she had not eaten for days . stood up , said : 
Meet at dinner ! 
And go fast . 
As the bell rings to announce the afternoon class , Harry and Ron head out to the North Tower , where the end of the twisted staircase ends , a silver staircase leading to the arched ceiling of the ceiling . , and the room where Professor Trelawney resides . 
The familiar sweet perfume was emanating from the fireplace at the small nose as they came up at the top of the ladder . 
As always , curtains are closed ; The circular room was bathed in a dim red light emanating from the many lamps , all covered with a towel wrapped with incense . 
Harry and Ron crossed over a pile of tallly painted chairs and a long mattress that filled the room , sitting together on a tiny round table . 
Welcome the game . 
Professor Trelawney's haughty voice snapped up Harry's back , causing it to jolt . 
Slightly thin with huge eyes , which made his eyes appear too big on his face , Professor Trelawney looked at Harry with a tragic face she always wore whenever he met Harry . 
The bulk of the bracelets , beads , and bracelets , as usual , lit up the Professor in the fire of the fireplace . 
She said to Harry , 
I'm worried , baby . 
My eyeballs look through the brave face of the child , see inside the disturbance . 
And I'm sad to tell you , the things that make me worry are not groundless . 
I see in front of you will be a difficult period , alas the hardest I'm afraid that I'm afraid to come true and can come soon than I thought 
Her voice dropped to almost a whisper . 
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry . 
Harry looked back at him coldly . 
Professor Trelawney swept the two of them and sat in an armchair in front of the fireplace , facing the whole class . 
Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil , who loved Prof . Trelawney , sat on the cushions next to her . 
Professor Trelawney said : 
Dear children , it is time to consider the stars . 
The motions of the planets and their mysterious harbots are only revealed to those who understand the steps of galactic dance . Human fate can be decoded by the rays of the planet , they mingle 
But Harry's thoughts drifted . 
The perfume always made it sleepy and dull , and Professor Trelawney's proverbial utterances never attracted it , although it could not help but think of what she said . I was afraid that what I was afraid of was coming true . 
But Hermione was right , Harry thought snobbishly , Professor Trelawney was an old fool . 
At the moment it does not fear anything at all , unless it is a little afraid that maybe Sirius was arrested but Professor Trelawney knows what ? 
It has come to the conclusion long ago that the prophecy of the neck is no more than a guessing experience combined with a ghostly style . 
Of course , except for that time at the end of the school year , when she predicted Voldemort would rise again and when Harry told Dumbledore , the old man said he thought the blow could be genuine . 
Harry ! 
Ron whispered . 
What ? 
Harry looked around ; The whole class was staring at it . 
He straightened up . 
It was almost asleep , straying in a state of flame and its thoughts . 
Professor Trelawney gave a bit of resentment as Harry did not bother to mention her words : 
I'm saying , honey , that you are obviously born under the shades of awe myth . 
Born under what ? 
I'm sorry 
Shen Nong , dear , Star Spirit farm . 
Professor Trelawney's voice sounded so irritating that Harry did not seem to be concentrating on the news . 
I'm saying that Shennong is definitely in a position of power in the galaxy at the moment of birth . The black hair of the small physique of the tragic loss of life as a child . Is it true that , baby , you were born in the middle of winter ? 
Harry replied , 
No , I was born in July . 
Ron quickly turned his big laugh into a dry cough . 
Half an hour later , each student in the class is given a complicated pie chart , and they try to fill the planet at the time they are born . 
It is a tedious task , requiring a look at the schedule and counting the corners too . 
After a while , Harry said , his shoulders glancing down at his parchment : 
We have two Neptune stars here , so that's not right , right ? 
Ron mimics Professor Trelawney's mysterious voice : 
When the two Neptune stars appear in the sky , Harry , that's sure of a kid wearing eye glasses coming out . 
Seamus and Dean are close by , laughing aloud , though not as loud as Lavender Brown's exclamation : 
Oh , professor , look ! 
I think you have an unfocused star ! 
What is it , Professor ? 
Professor Trelawney looked down at the diagram and said , 
that's Uranus , honey 
Asked Ron : 
How can one find a Uranus star ? 
Bad luck , Professor Trelawney heard , and probably so that at the end of the lesson , she gave them a heap of so many homework . 
She repeatedly said , like Professor McGonagall , rather than her daily , light - hearted : 
A detailed analysis of how the galaxy's motion will affect games in the coming months , remember to map their own games . 
I want to submit the next Monday , do not have any excuse it ! 
Poor old bad girl . 
This article will take two days weekend , will 
Said Ron bitterly as he entered the crowd to go down the stairs , back to the hall and have dinner . 
Hermione caught up with them , happily saying : 
Too many exercises ? 
Vector professor did not give us this one ! 
Ron : 
Good , cheer up Professor Vector . 
They reached the lobby , which was packed with people waiting for dinner . 
The young man just entered the end of the line , a voice shouted behind him : 
Weasley ! 
Hey , Weasley ! 
Harry , Ron and Hermione turned around . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , Goyle was standing there , the one who seemed to be enjoying something . 
Ron said curtly . 
What ? 
You on the newspaper , weasley ! 
Malfoy said , waving a Proclamation . 
It was very loud , so that all the crowded halls would have to hear . 
Listen ! 
ADD THE LETTERS IN THE MINISTRY 
It seems the troubles at the Ministry of Magic have not come to an end yet , said Rita Skeeter , a special correspondent for the junta . 
Just recently being blamed for controlling too few people in the Quidditch Cup , and yet unable to explain the disappearance of one of their wizards , the Department is deeply embedded in a new incident . Yesterday , caused by the clowns of Arnold Weasley , of the Muggle Department . 
Malfoy looked up and rang : 
Imagine , weasley , to the guy he did not write right . 
So he almost did not have any value , right ? 
Everyone in the lobby is listening ear . 
Malfoy unfurled the newspaper and read : 
Arnold Weasley , who has been convicted of owning a car two years ago , has been involved in a fight with law - abiding Muggles ( police ) for a while . junk is extremely aggressive . 
Mr. Weasley had apparently rushed to support Moody's Crazy , a former senior of the Department of Light , retired when he could no longer distinguish between an honest handshake and a murder . . 
When he arrived at Mr. Moody's heavily - guarded home , Mr. Weasley discovered , no surprise , that Moody once again fabricated the false alarm . 
Mr. Weasley had to fix some of his memories before escaping from the police , but he refused to answer the NAPA's questions about why he had dragged him into an uncharacteristic and ugly stage . tiger to so . 
Malfoy said , flipping over the newspaper and raising : 
There's another picture , Weasley ! 
A photograph of three mothers standing outside the house , if you call it home ! 
Frown that reduced a few pounds , she was happy , right ? 
Ron shivered with anger . 
Everyone was staring at him . 
Harry said : 
Malfoy ! Let's go , Ron 
Malfoy laughs : 
Oh , you're at home last summer , are not you Potter ? 
Tell me , is it cheeky like a pig , or just a picture ? 
Both Harry and Hermione grabbed Ron's tail to stop him from jumping on Malfoy . 
Harry said : 
How do you know Malfoy ? 
The look on her face as if there was a pile of feces right under her nose . 
Do you always look like that , or just because you were there next time ? 
Malfoy's face was slightly reddish : 
Do not take the risk off my cheek , Potter . 
Shut your mouth ! 
Said Harry and turned away . 
BANG ! 
Many people scream . 
Harry felt something whitish , hot flashing across his face . 
He reached into his pocket to find his wand , but before touching the wand , he heard a second Mandarin , and a roar rang across the hall . 
Ồ NO , NO , YES YOU ! 
Harry turns horizontally . 
Professor Moody was limping down on the marble stairs . 
His wand leaned out and was pointing straight into a white cedar , standing trembling on the stone floor , just as Malfoy had just stood . 
A terrible silence in the lobby . 
No one , except Moody , dared to move to a muscle . 
Moody turned to look at Harry , or at least , his normal eye looking at Harry , and the other eye was looking behind him . 
Does it hurt ? 
Moody growled . 
His voice was low and small . 
No , sir ! Suddenly Moody yells : 
YET ! 
Asked Harry , 
to what ? 
Not that guy ! 
Moody growled , thrusting his thumb over his shoulder , pointing at Crabbe , who was almost petrified , picking up the coterie . 
It seems Moody's eye can be magical and can be seen behind his back . 
Moody starts limping toward Crabbe , Goyle and the coyote , who screams and then flees toward the dungeon . 
Moody roared : 
I do not think so ! 
Then pointed his wand at the cot again . 
The fox flies up to three feet , falls to the floor , and then bounces again . 
I do not like the attack when people turn away . Moody screamed as the cannabis bouncing higher and higher , screaming in pain : 
To do all the rotten , despicable , scum 
The weasels flew in the air , their legs and tail dangling helplessly . 
do not - do - now - do - do - anymore - hear - not ! 
Moody word for word while the coyote falls to the stone floor and bounces on the threshold . 
Suddenly a voice said , 
Professor Moody ! 
Professor McGonagall was walking down the stone stairs , her hands full of books . 
Hello Professor McGonagall . 
Moody said calmly , making the ferret bounce higher . 
What do you do ? 
Professor McGonagall asked , her eyes watching the cannabis bounce up in the air . 
Teach . Moody replied . 
Professor McGonagall screamed , her husband's book fell from her : 
Teaching English Moody , is that a pupil ? 
it's correct . 
Are not ! 
Professor McGonagall shouted , running down the ladder , pulling out the wand . 
At the same time with a blast , Malfoy appeared again , lying in a heap on the floor , his blond hair flushed and his face now red . 
He stood up , scowling . 
Professor McGonagall said weakly : 
Brother Moody , we never take the verdict to make a penalty ! 
Did Professor Dumbledore tell you that ? 
Moody replied as he scratched his chin . 
Looks like say yes . 
But I think a good shock at the right time 
We took a fine , Moody ! 
Or tell the homeroom teacher the home of the offending student . 
Moody says , staring at Malfoy full of hate : 
Next time I will do that . 
Malfoy , pale blue eyes are still tearful of pain and humiliation watching Moody with malicious eyes , mouth muttering something that most certainly heard from my three . 
Oh , so ? 
Moody said quietly , limping a few steps , the creaking of the wooden leg ringed in the hallway : 
Oh , baby , I know you three in the past Certainly told him that Moody was following his son in the mornin's sayin ' what I said So now , your home teacher is Snape's teacher ? 
it's correct ! Malfoy resigned . 
Moody growled : 
Again , an old friend I waited for some time to be chatted with my friend Snape 
And he pulled the Malfoy upside down , pushing it toward the dungeons . 
Professor McGonagall watched them anxiously for a while , then waved the wand into the stack of books , causing them to soar back into her arms . 
A few minutes later , as he was sitting at the Gryffindor table , surrounded by a gloomy voice about what had just happened . 
Ron quietly said to Harry and Hermione : 
Do not talk to me ! 
Asked Hermione , 
Why not ? 
I want to put it in my memory forever . 
Said Ron , his eyes closed and an expression of excitement appeared on his face : 
Draco Malfoy , the weasel , bounced wildly 
Harry and Hermione both laughed , and Hermione started distributing the stewed beef on each plate . 
She said : 
Do not you dare to hurt Malfoy ! 
Also Professor McGonagall stopped 
Ron shouted angrily , eyes piercing , irritable : 
Hermione ! 
You are spoiling the best moment of your life ! 
Hermione caused a faint sound and started to eat again . 
Harry looked at her : 
Do not tell me you're going to the library tonight ! 
Said Hermione firmly . 
come on ! 
A lot of work to do . 
But he says Vector 
Not exercises . 
Said Hermione . 
Within five minutes , she cleaned her plate and left . 
She had just left Fred Weasley on the spot . 
It says : 
God , Moody ! 
How cool ? 
Too cool ! George said , pulling down the seat to face Fred . 
Super cool Lee Jordan , a close friend of twins , said as he slid down to sit next to George . 
It informs Harry and Ron : 
This afternoon we have our teacher's time . 
Harry eagerly : 
How is the class ? 
Fred , George and Lee exchanged meaningful visions . 
Have never studied like that before . Fred said . 
Teacher very small , oh ! Lee said . 
What is it ? Ron leaned forward , asking . 
How do you do that ? George was impressed . 
Do what ? Said Harry 
Against the Dark Arts . Fred replied 
What he smelled well . George added . 
Excellent shot ! Lee said . 
Ron Green in his pocket out schedule : 
To the fifth we have teachers now ! It's disappointing , says . 
CHAPTER 14 THE BENEFITS CAN NOT WORK 
Two days later , nothing would have mattered , except for the fact that Neville had melted his sixth cauldron during the poison hour . 
Professor Snape , seems to have reached a new level of hatred after a summer , arresting Neville for a ban , and Neville returning from a punishment in a mental collapse , for having caught every bowel in a bowl . full of horns . 
Ron told Harry as they stood with Hermione pointing to Neville using a scouring cleansing pad to wipe the gut from his nails : 
Do you know why Snape is crazy ? 
Know . 
At Moody . Said Harry . 
It was well known that Snape was keen to teach Dark Arts , and now he has failed in the race for the fourth year . 
Snape hated all the teachers of the dark arts , and revealed the hatred . 
But surprisingly , he seemed cautious when expressing resentment to Moody Eyes - crazy . 
Indeed , every time Harry saw them together - at lunchtime or in the corridor - it was clear that Snape avoided seeing Moody's eye , whether it was the eye or the magician's eye . 
Harry pensive : 
You know , I think Snape is a great teacher , Moody . 
Said Ron , eyes dreamy : 
Imagine Mr. Moody turning Snape into a horrible toad , then tossing him around in his hatch . 
Gryffindor's fourth - year students looked forward to Moody's first day of class , so that on Thursday , they came to class early in the morning from lunchtime , lined up in front of the classroom before the bell rang . 
The only person who was not there was Hermione , who just came home from school . 
Now stay 
Library . Harry finishes his sentence for Hermione : Come on , hurry up , there is no good place to sit . 
The three hastily took up three chairs in front of the teacher's desk , taking out the book : Dark Force - Guiding the Self - Defense , and waiting , unusually quiet . 
Soon they heard footsteps of Mr. Moody along the corridor , and he entered the classroom , looking both stranger and fearsome than ever . 
And they had just seen a wooden claw with his claws peeking out under his loincloth . 
He snuggled up to the table and sat down , 
They put that aside . 
Those books do not need to . 
The children in the book . 
Ron looked excited . 
Moody shook off a list , shook the mane of the salty hair away from his distorted face and scarred , and began to roll . 
His normal gaze listens slowly , while his eyes are spinning , sticking to each student whenever he answers . 
That's it . He said , when the last one was present . 
I received a letter from Lupine about this class . 
It looks like they have quite a bit of knowledge about how to deal with dark creatures . You know how to deal with Kooks , ghosts , manta rays , ghosts , and werewolves , right ? 
The fence agreed . 
But the game is poor - very poor - in handling some curse . 
So I came here to raise the standard of what witches can do with each other . 
I have a year to teach you how to deal with Dark . 
Exclaimed Ron : 
Why do not you stay ? 
Moody's magical eyes turned round , staring at Ron . 
Ron looked terrified . 
But a moment later , Moody smiled - for the first time Harry saw him doing so . 
As a consequence , his scaly face looked cramped and wrinkled , but nevertheless , seeing him as friendly as the smile was just as good . 
Ron is so lightweight . 
Are you the son of Arthur Weasley , huh ? 
My father pulled me out of a jam several days ago , I only stayed here for a year . 
Special help for Dumbledore One year , then back to his quiet retirement . 
Mr. Moody laughed dryly , and clapped his hands together on one another : 
Then the problem . 
Curses 
Poems have many forms , many weak levels . 
Currently , according to the Ministry of Magic , I should only teach the counter - offensive and stop there . 
I suppose I should not have played the game for the illegal black curses , until the games were up to sixth . 
I think the games are big enough to deal with that . 
But Professor Dumbledore has a higher view of the nerves of the game , thinking that the games can be confronted , and I also say , the sooner you learn to cope with what the better . 
But how can you defend yourself , against something while you have not seen it yet ? 
A witch is going to unleash an illicit curse on him and never tell him what he's going to do . 
He will not do it in a cute way , elegant with his face . 
Therefore , the games should be prepared . 
You need to be alert and cautious . 
You need to put that aside , Miss Brown , while I'm talking . 
Lavender snapped , and flushed . 
He was giving Parvati his raw horoscope in his desk . 
It is clear that Moody's vision can be seen through solid wood , as well as being visible through the back . 
So who among you knows the curse that is the most witchcraft law ? 
Hands up , Ron and Hermione . 
Moody pointed at Ron , though his magician's eyes remained fixed on Lavender . 
Ron hesitated : 
Did you tell me about one ? Is that a curse of dictatorship , or something ? 
Ah , yes . Teacher Moody agrees . 
You must know that curse already . 
Once caused the Ministry of trouble , that domineering curse . 
Thick Moody walked limp , opened the drawer , took out a glass jar . 
Three big black spiders are hurrying around inside . 
Harry felt Ron's back to sit close to him - Ron still spiders . 
Mr. Moody reached into the jar , caught a spider , dropped it in the palm of his hand to see the whole class . 
Then he pointed his wand at the spider and muttered : 
arbitrary ! 
The spider jumped out of Moody's hand on a silk thread and began to hit him forward , backwards as if he were on a beamer . 
He stretched out the legs rigidly , then backed off , broke the silk thread , and landed on the table , where it began to tumble on the legs in a circle . 
Mr. Moody wiggled his wand , and the spider stood up on his hind legs , starting to do something that could not be mistaken for a stunt . 
Everyone laughs ha ha - everyone , except Moody . 
Shout growled : 
Are the games fun ? 
You also like , do not you , if I do it myself ? 
Laughter immediately shut down . 
The spider turns round and rolls over . 
Mr. Moody quietly said : 
Full control . 
I could make it jump out the window , drown myself , throw myself down my throat 
Ron suddenly shivered . 
Many years ago , there were many male and female witches were controlled by arbitrary curse . 
Harry knew that Moody was talking about the days when Voldemort had been in charge of all the power . 
There is work for the ministry , they must try to filter out who has acted because of coercion , and who has acted freely according to their will . Can resist the arbitrary curse , and I will teach you how to do it . , but it requires a really strong personality , and that's not all . 
It is best to avoid touching the curse if you can avoid it . RIGHT NOW ! 
He roared , and the class snapped . 
Mr. Moody picked up the spider and threw it back into the jar . 
Who knows any other curse ? 
Another illegal curse ? 
Hermione's hand fluttered into the air , and Harry was surprised to find Neville's arm too . 
The only class that Neville used to invoke was herbal medicine , which was the easiest subject for her . 
Neville also seems surprised about his own liver . 
Star ? 
said Moody , the magician's magician's eye on Neville . 
Neville said tiny but distinctly : 
There is a curse curse Torture . 
Mr. Moody looked at Neville intently , this time with both eyes : 
The name is Longbottom . 
Then his magician's eye slammed down the log again . 
Neville nervously nodded , but Moody asked nothing . 
Turning back to the class , he reached into the jar and took out the next spider and placed it on the table . 
The spider stood motionless , obviously too afraid to dare not take steps . 
Curse of abuse . 
Make a bit of sense for the concept . 
He pointed his wand at the spider , shouting : 
Engorgio ! ( meaning : bulge ! ) 
Spider blooms . 
Now it's bigger than a hairy spider . 
No longer hiding , Ron pushed his chair backward , as far away from Moody's desk as possible . 
Mr. Moody raised his chopsticks again , pointed at the spider , and whispered : 
Crucio ! ( Meaning : Torture ! ) 
Immediately , the spider's spine curls into the body , it rolls and begins to twitch fearfully , from side to side . 
There was no sound from the spider , but Harry was sure that if the spider could make a scream , it must have been a scream . Moody did not move the wand , and the spider started shaking . shaking , convulsing increasingly intense . 
Cried Hermione , 
Stop ! 
Harry turned to Hermione . 
She was looking , but not looking at the spider , but Neville ; and Harry , watching Hermione's eyes , saw Neville's hands clench at the table in front of him , his fingers white , his eyes wide with horror . 
Moody raised his wand . 
The spider legs stretched , but then it continued to twitch . 
Reducio ! ( That is : Teo again ! ) 
Moody whispered , and the spider shrank to its proper size . 
He put it back in the jar , quietly said : 
pain . 
No need for nails or knives , you can torture someone if you execute the curse . Torture is also a popular curse a while . 
And who knows what else ? 
Harry looked around . 
Looking at everyone's eyes , he guessed that they were all guessing what would happen to the last spider . 
Hermione's hand shook slightly , and then , she raised it to the sky , the third time . 
Star ? 
Moody looked at her . 
Hermione whispered : 
Avada Kedavra . 
Some uncomfortable classmates looked at Hermione , including Ron . 
Said Moody , a slight grin on his mouth : 
A ! 
Yes , the last and the worst . 
Avada Kedavra - Killing Curse . 
He poked his wand into the glass jar , and seemed to know what was about to happen ; the third spit ran frantically around the bottom of the jar , trying to hide Moody's fingers , but He wrapped it up , placing it on the table . 
The spider started running like crazy on the wood . 
Mr. Moody held up his wand , and Harry suddenly found himself shivering with anticipation . 
Teacher shouted : 
Avada Kedavra ! 
A lightning bolt dazzles with a fence sound , as if something vast , invisible soaring in the air - the spider immediately falls back , without a trace , but can not wrong , dead . 
Many girls cry , Ron falls back and almost falls off the chair as the spider slides towards it . 
Mr. Moody drove the dead spider on the table to the floor and said calmly : 
Not nice at all . 
Not pleasant at all . 
Not even to the counter . 
No way to stop it . 
From the past only one survivor was with him , and he was sitting right in front of me . 
Harry felt his face flush when Moody's eyes ( both eyes ) looked at it . 
It feels like everyone around him looks at it . 
Harry stared at the blank board as if hypnotized by the panel , but actually did not see anything 
So how did his parents die like a spider ? 
Do they die without a trace , so deadly so ? 
Did they just see the lightning bolt and hear the sound of death rush in , before life was swept away from their bodies ? 
Over the past three years , Harry has rebuilt the death of his parents since he discovered they had been killed , since it discovered what had happened that night . Tracing the wormhole to Harry's hiding place for Voldemort , he came looking for them in the hut . 
Harry imagined how Voldemort had killed his father , how James Potter had fought him , while he screamed at Harry , who ran away . Voldemort threatened Lily Potter , telling her to stand aside to kill Harry . Harry imagines she had begged him to kill her life and decided not to stop her baby and Voldemort killed her , before pointing her wand at Harry . 
Harry knew all these details as he heard the cry of his parents , as he fought with the jailers last year . It is the dreadful power of the dementors to force their victims to relive the darkest memories of their lives , drowning them , exhausting their despair . 
Brother Moody said again , but with Harry it sounded like somewhere far away . 
With a huge effort , it pulled me back to the present and listened to what he was saying . 
Avada Kedavra is a curse that needs to have behind it a powerful magic - the game now withdrew the wand , and pointed at me to read the mantra , then I suspected that the same just made me flow a little Orange juice . 
But okay . 
I'm not here to teach you how to do that . 
Now , if there is no counterattack , why do I give you games ? 
Because you have to know about it . 
You have to know what the worst is . 
The game does not want to find yourself falling into the situation facing it . 
So PLEASE ATTRACTIONS . 
Thieves roared , and the whole class jumped . 
Now these three curses - Avada Kedavra , domineering , and Torture - are called Unforgettable Curse . 
Just apply one of the three curses on a human being who lives long enough in Azkaban . That's what I have to teach the fight . 
Games should be prepared . 
Games should be equipped . 
But more than all , the game needs constant vigilance , do not stop vigilance . 
To write the feather goose to copy that sentence 
The kids spend the rest of the lesson to write notes about The Unforgettable Curse . 
No one spoke until the bell rang , but as soon as Mr. Moody left the classroom and left the classroom , a stream of talk broke down . 
Most of the students talk about curses with fear - Do you see it convulsed ? , when he killed it less than half - heartedly ! 
Harry thought , they talked about the class like talking about something spectacular . 
But it does not seem to be entertaining here - and so is Hermione . 
Hurry up ! Tensioned to Harry and Ron . 
Asked Ron : 
Do not go to that damn library anymore ? 
Hermione replied curtly , pointing to the corridor side : 
Are not . 
Look , Neville ! 
Neville was standing alone , in the middle of the aisle , staring at the opposite wall of stone , his eyes wide with horror as he watched Moody's curse show Abuse . 
Neville ! Asked Hermione softly . 
Neville looked around . 
Oh , hi . His voice is higher than usual . Good lesson ? 
I'm thinking tonight what to eat , my hunger near death , how are you hungry ? 
Neville , are you okay ? Asked Hermione . 
Neville stammered , his voice unusually high . 
Oh , no , I'm fine , dinner is so interesting What do you want to say tonight ? 
Ron looked at Harry . 
Neville , what's up ? 
But behind them they suddenly heard a strange whirring sound , and they saw Professor Moody limping toward them . 
The four were silent , scared to look at the teacher , but when he spoke , his growling sounded louder , gentler than ever when they still hear . 
He told Neville : 
Okay , son ? 
Why do not you go to my office ? Go to your teacher to make tea 
Neville looked frightened at the prospect of sipping tea with Moody . 
It can not speak , can not go . 
Brother Moody turned his magical eye toward Harry : 
Are you okay , Potter ? 
No , Harry replied , quite stubborn . 
Moody's blue eyes fluttered in his sockets as he watched Harry . 
Then he said : 
You need to know . 
It may be cruel , but you must know . 
Can not pretend , Longbottom , you have some books that you may like . 
Neville begged for Harry , Ron and Hermione , but the three of them did not say anything , so Neville had no choice but to let Mr. Moody go , with a tufted hand on his shoulder . 
What is this ? Ron looked at Neville and Moody turned to the corner . 
Do not know . Asked Hermione . 
Is learning new school , huh ? 
Ron said to Harry as they entered the hall . 
Fred and George are right , right ? 
Is Moody right ? 
When he made Avada Kedavra and the way the spider rolls to death , make it to the correct way . 
But Ron suddenly stopped to look at Harry's face , and he did not speak until they were in the hall . Then he told him to think that the two of them should begin to work on Professor Trelawney's prophecy tonight . Yes , that exercise will take hours . 
Hermione did not participate in Harry and Ron's struggles during dinner . 
She just devours devour , then left the dining room run to the library . 
Harry and Ron walk to Gryffindor Tower ; And Harry , during the meal , did not think of anything else , and now he was giving the Unforgettable Words to the table . 
Would Moody with Dumbledore be troubled if the Department knew we were cursed ? Harry asked as they approached Mrs. Beo . 
That's great , Ron said . But Dumbledore is always doing things his way , and Moody has been in trouble for years now , I think . 
Do before then calculated , see the trash of the teacher is known . 
Three three . 
Ms . Beo flushed forward to reveal the hole in the portrait , and they dug into Gryffindor's common room , which was crowded and loud . 
Harry asked : 
Do the Prophets ? 
Oh , sure . Ron moaned . 
They climbed up to the bedroom to get books and charts , seeing Neville alone , sitting in bed reading . 
It was much more peaceful than when Moody's class was over , though it had not returned to normal . 
His eyes were still red . 
No , Neville ? Asked Harry . 
Oh , that's fine , Neville said . I'm fine , thank you . Reading Professor Moody lent him 
It exposes the book : Mystical Plants of the Mediterranean and their features : 
It is clear that Professor Sprout told Professor Moody that he was quite a herbalist . 
In his voice there was a sense of pride that Harry had rarely heard before . 
He thinks he likes this book . Neville said . 
Harry thought , telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said was a subtle way to make Neville happy , because Neville rarely heard anyone complimenting him for anything . 
In the past , Professor Lupine used to do the same . 
Harry and Ron bring his Future Curtain down to the common room , find a table , and begin to predict for next month . 
Until an hour later , they were only a little ahead , though the table was covered with parchment marks littering with mathematical and symbolic signs , and Harry's mind was as clouded as the furnace . Heating of Professor Smoked Trelawney . 
Harry stared at the long list of mathematical operations : 
I do not detect clues meaning of these demons . 
Ron said , his hair was upright because his fingers were constantly rubbing his head in despair . 
You do not know , I think this game just rely on the ancient guess is done . 
What ? Make it ? 
Anyway , Ron said as he rubbed the crumpled paper off the table , dipped the ink , and started writing , just as he reads : 
Next Monday , I will probably cough , it is due to the association between Mars and Jupiter . 
She looked up at Harry : 
You know that the neck is stuffed all the pain is inflamed neck is all . 
Already ! Harry said , creasing his head at first and flipping it over the head of his first - year student , 
Then Monday , I will be in danger of being burned . 
Yes , you will . Ron said gloomily , we are going to meet again the Monsters on Monday . 
Well , Tuesday , I ' ll be fine 
Take a precious thing . Harry continued , flipping through the Future Screen to find his mind . 
Good idea . Said Ron , copy right down . Because , um , Mercury . 
Why do not you have a person you think you stabbed your back ? 
That's right , Harry said hurriedly . 
because Venus is in the twelfth . 
And on Wednesday , I thought I would have the worst outcome in a game . 
Ah , I'm going to play . 
Then , I will lose bets . 
Oh , you bet you won . 
For hours afterwards , they continue to make predictions ( which are more and more tragic ) , while the common room is slowly emptying , people are going to the bedroom . 
Crookshanks hovered around them , jumping lightly on an empty chair , and stared at Harry mysteriously , more than Hermione looked at them knowing they did not do homework at all . 
Looking around the room , trying to figure out what the risk was not used , Harry saw that Fred and George were sitting together on the opposite wall , the goose feather quilt racing on a parchment . Best . It was the most unusual sight of Fred and George hiding in a corner and quietly working ; They still like to stay in the bowl , the center of the noisy to attract attention . 
There seemed to be something hidden behind the way they worked on the parchment , which reminded Harry the way they'd been drafting a reply at the Burrow ; Harry thought it was a Weasley Witch order , but this time it did not look right , otherwise they would have given Lee Jordan a joke . 
Harry wondered if this had anything to do with the Magic Triangle . 
While Harry was staring at him , George nodded to Fred , took out the goose feather , and said , though in a very quiet voice , was still being passed near the end of the room : 
Do not sound like you're accusing him too Be careful 
Then George looked around , seeing Harry looking at him . 
Harry grinned and quickly turned back to his prophetic exercise - he did not want George thinking it was a wiretap . 
A little later , the twins rolled the parchment , good night , and went to bed . 
Fred and George walked for about ten minutes , the portrait opened and Hermione climbed into the common room , a hand holding a bunch of parchment , a hand holding a box with a clatter of what went by . little girl , Crookshanks stretched her back and cursed 
Hi , new job ! Said Hermione . 
I'm new ! 
Ron triumphantly threw the goose down . 
Hermione sat down , put some things in her hands , hugged an empty chair , and dragged Ron's prophecy to him : 
Next month is not it good ? 
Said Hermione , mockingly , while Crookshanks rolled to sit on her lap . 
Ron yawned : 
Oh , but at least I foresee . 
Cried Hermione . 
Oh , it seems you drowned two times ! 
Oh , so Ron , looking at his prophecy . Let's change it to be a bad temper . 
You do not see clearly that you just made up these demons ? 
How dare you say that ? Shouted Ron , pretending to be very insulting . We had to crawl like eagles all the time . 
Hermione frowned . 
Ron's golden countertop : 
Just a way to say it ! 
Harry had also written down , having just finished predicting that he would be beheaded . 
She pointed to the box , asking : 
What's in it ? 
You asked , also strange ! 
Said Hermione , looking at Ron uncomfortably . 
She opened the box and showed them it . 
Inside is a dozen medallions , all in different colors , all with H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
Asked Harry , picking up a medal to see : 
Duck Eggs For Eating Right ? 
What does that mean ? 
Hermione loses her patience : 
Not ' Ducklings for Erotic Rights ' but H . V . D . C . Q . L . G . T . . 
Short for the Goodwill Association . 
Never heard of . Said Ron . 
Said Hermione briskly : 
Of course , you have not heard that yet , I just started . 
Shouted Ron , a little surprised : 
What ? 
How many members do you have ? 
If you two always go to three . 
Said Ron : 
And do you think we will go round , bring the badge sign Duck Honey ? 
Cried Hermione fiercely : 
H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
! 
I am going to Prevent Mysterious Bioterrorism , and Legitimate Change of Status of Mysterious Creatures , but not yet . That's just the beginning of our manifesto . 
When she finished , she threw away the parchment paper for them : 
I have studied the whole library . 
Slavery has been around for centuries . 
Unbelievably , since then no one has done anything for it . 
Shouted Ron . 
Hermione - Listen carefully ! 
We - it - enjoy - talk - it . 
They like slavery ! 
Hermione said , still louder than Ron , as if she had not heard the words before : 
Our short - term goal is to ensure fair wages and fair working conditions for the elite . 
Our long - term goal is to change the law not to use chopsticks , and then try to put an elf to the Commission to coordinate and control the occult , because their representation numbers are horrendously low . . 
How do you do all that ? Asked Harry . 
Hermione replied happily : 
Start by recruiting members . 
I think Sickle is about to join - enough badge to buy - and this money can fund our brochure campaign . 
Ron , you're the treasurer . 
I give you 
The cans to raise coins are upstairs . 
And Harry , you're the secretary , so please record what you're saying , as our first meeting minutes . 
There was silence , and Hermione smiled brightly at the two of them . 
Harry plopped down , torn between being annoyed by Hermione , and one of them was laughing while looking at Ron's face . 
The silence was broken , but not by Ron , who was strangling for a minute , but for a croaking , gently pressing on the window . 
Harry gazed into the moonlight , a snow - white owl sitting on the window sill . 
It shouted : 
Hedwig ! 
Then came out of the chair , across the room , to open the door . 
Hedwig flew in , hovering over the room , then parked on the table , right on Harry's Prophecy . 
Come on ! Harry said as he hurriedly ran after the owl . 
Ron pointed at the filthy parchment at the foot of the owl , exclaiming excitement : 
It's got a reply ! 
Harry hurriedly took off the parchment , sat down to read , while Hedwig patted the pillow down his knees , snuggling smoothly . 
Asked Hermione , almost holding her breath : 
What does the letter say ? 
The letter is very short , which seems to be written in a very hasty way . 
Harry read aloud : 
Harry , 
You fly to the North right here . 
The news of my oysters is the last of a series of bizarre rumors that you get here . 
If the scars hurt again , you go straight to Dumbledore - people say he pulled Eye - crazy out of retirement , meaning he read the signs , even if no one read . 
I will contact you soon . 
Send your wishes to Ro n and Hermione . 
Seriously , Harry ! 
Sirius 
Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione , who were staring at Harry . 
Whispered Hermione : 
Does he fly to the North Sea ? 
Does he come back ? 
Ron looks very confused : 
What is Dumbledore reading ? Harry , what does that mean ? 
Harry fisted his fists on his forehead , ejecting Hedwig from his lap . 
She was angry : 
I should not have told him that ! 
Ron's surprise : 
What do you mean ? 
Harry made a fist on the table , causing Hedwig to fall on Ron's chair , choking on his anger . 
This made him come back ! 
Go back , just because he thinks he's in trouble ! 
Which trouble does not happen to me ? 
I have nothing for you 
She turned to Hedwig : 
want to eat up the whip eat that ! 
Hedwig threw Harry an extreme look of affection and flew right out the window , as he passed Harry's broad canvas . 
Hermione opened her voice , calmly : 
Harry ! 
We go to bed Harry said curtly . See you tomorrow morning . 
In the bedroom upstairs , he was wearing pajamas and was in bed , but he did not sleep well . 
If Sirius returned and was captured , it was his fault , Harry's ! 
Why does not it shut up ? 
It's only a few seconds of pain and it must be revealed as well 
He heard Ron enter the bedroom a moment later , but did not speak to Ron . 
A long , long time , Harry lay , staring at the top of the mosquito . 
The bedroom was completely quiet , and it was less anxious . 
Harry may have noticed that the absence of Neville's nape of the week meant he was not the only one lying down . 
Chapter 15 BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG SCHOOLS 
Early the next morning , Harry woke up with a plan filled up in his head , as if his sleepy brain had been working on the matter all night . 
He sat up , dressed in pale morning light , left the bedroom without waking Ron , going down to the common room quietly . 
Here , she took a piece of parchment from the table and laid it on the prophetic exercise , writing the following letter : 
Dear Sirius , 
I found out only at the imagination of the pain scars , when writing to me before sleeping . 
No matter what happens , here things are good . 
Do not worry about me , I see the head completely normal . 
Harry 
Then he climbed out of the portrait hole and went up to the mansion ( just a little clogged , as the Peeves flipped a Harry pot in the middle of the pass , along the fourth floor corridor ) , finally to the owl's cage , located at the top of the West Tower . 
The owl is a circular stone room , quite cold and windy , because no windows here are glassy , ​​ floors covered with straw and bird droppings , along with some mouse skeletons and rat rats . Release . 
Hundreds , hundreds of owls , every possible breed in the world , stand huddled on top of a pole peeping straight to the top of the tower . 
Almost all of them were asleep , though somewhere had an amber eye glaring at Harry . 
He saw Hedwig parked in the middle of a pig with a fierce owl , and rushed over to the owl , slightly slipping on the floor full of birds . 
It took Harry a while to convince the owl to get up and take a look at it , while the owl walked around on the perch , pointing his tail at Harry's face . 
The owl is clearly angry because of the attitude 
ungrateful of Harry the night before . 
After all , Harry suggested to Hedwig that if he was too tired to borrow Harry Pigwidgeon , then Hedwig would stand up and let Harry put the letter . 
You must find him ! 
Before the dementors found . 
Harry said as he stroked the back of the owl , while holding it in his hand toward a hole in the wall . 
The snout gnawed at Harry's fingers , probably slightly stronger than he'd gnawed all day , but he snuggled up the way he was . 
Then it spread its wings in the light of dawn . 
Harry looked up at the owl until it disappeared with an unpleasant sensation returning in his stomach . 
It was Sirius's reply that he had to lighten his worries more than to add to this . 
That's a lie , Harry . 
Hermione spoke up at breakfast , as Harry told Ron and Hermione what he had done . 
You never imagined that the pain would hurt , you know . 
So what ? 
Harry said , he can not go back to Azkaban for himself . 
Stop it ! 
Ron's voice turns to Hermione as she opens her mouth to say a few words . 
Again , Hermione glared at Ron and was silent . 
For the past two weeks , Harry had tried his best not to think of Sirius . 
Indeed , it can not stop you from looking anxious every morning , when the mail is coming ; could not resist , every night before going to bed , again saw the terrible vision occurred to Sirius , the darlings were piled into some dark corner in London . 
Between those two moments , he tried not to think of the godfather . 
He wished that Quidditch was still there to distract him , nothing better than a messy mind with a good and hard workout . 
On the other hand , subjects are becoming increasingly difficult and demanding , especially Moody's Anti - Artistic Defense . 
To their surprise , Professor Moody announced that he would turn the autobiographical curse on each of them to show the power of the curse as well as to see if they could withstand the impact . of it or not . 
But he said it was illegal that teacher ? 
Hermione asked hesitantly as Moody brushed the tables with a wand scan , leaving an empty space in the middle of the room . 
Teacher says to apply it to someone who is 
Moody's eyes widened at Hermione and stared at her with a bizarre look , without blinking : 
Dumbledore wants to be taught the true feeling . 
If you want to learn the hard way - that is when someone throws a curse on the game they can control the game completely - that's fine . 
Games are exempt . 
Let's go out . 
He pointed a bony finger toward the door . 
Hermione blushed and muttered something that she did not intend to leave . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other grinning . 
They knew that Hermione would rather swallow a tuberous plant than to miss an important lesson like this . 
Mr. Moody began to signal to the students to move forward and read the curse on each of the children . 
Harry , one by one , one by one , is doing the most bizarre things under the influence of the curse . 
Dean Thomas hopped three rounds around the room , singing the national anthem . 
Lavender Brown imitates the squirrel . 
Neville performed a series of strange gymnastics exercises that were undoubtedly normal . 
Neither of them seemed to be able to resist the curse , and each of them only recovered when Moody dropped the curse . 
Potter , next to the game . Moody growled . 
Harry stepped forward , out in the middle of the classroom , into the open space where Master Moody had cleaned the table . 
He raised his wand , pointed at Harry , and shouted : Imperio ! 
It was the best feeling Harry felt as if he floated , every thought , every anxiety in his head was swept away gently , leaving nothing but a vague happiness , hard to describe . 
He stood there , feeling completely relaxed , just dreaming that everyone was looking at him . 
And then he heard Moody's Eye - mad , echoing in some distant corner of his brain : Jump on the table to jump on the table ! 
Harry obeyed , kneeling down , preparing to jump . 
Jump on the table ! ... 
Oh , why ? 
Another voice woke up behind the brain . 
It's a stupid thing to do , really , voices . 
Jump on the table ! ... 
No , I will not jump , thanks . 
The other voice said , a little hard , I really do not want 
JUMP , DANCE NOW ! 
Just then , Harry felt a terrible pain . 
He just wants to dance , he wants to stop himself from dancing . 
As a result , it staggered at the table , dropped it , and felt as if it had broken both the knees . 
Well , pretty much ! 
Brother Moody snarled , and suddenly Harry saw the echo , empty in his head where he lost . 
He remembered exactly what was happening , and the pain on his knees seemed to have doubled . 
Look , all the Potter has resisted ! 
She is resistant to the curse , just smashed the curse again ! 
We will try again , Potter , and all the rest , pay attention , look in his eyes , look at that very well , Potter , very , very good ! 
They are hard to control me ! 
The way he said it made me think as if the whole group could be attacked at any moment . 
Harry muttered as he stepped out of the Dark Arts Defense class an hour later . Moody insists that Harry must try four times at a time , until it can completely dispel the curse . 
Oh , I know . 
Said Ron , jumping two stairs . 
He had more trouble with the curse than Harry , though Moody had reassured him that the effects on lunch would be to fly clean . 
It is doubtful 
Ron looked at Mr. Moody for sure , not sure what he was talking about , and continued : 
I was so happy when I got rid of him from the Ministry . 
Do you listen to Master Tell Seamus what did you do with the witch - witch who dared to protest at his back on April Fool's Day ? 
Some 
Do we have time to study how to resist the authoritative curse when there are so many other things to do ? 
All four of the fourth year saw a significant increase in the volume of jobs that required them to do this semester . 
Professor McGonagall explained the reason , as the whole class moaned loudly in front of the exercises she had given her : 
The games are now entering the most critical stage of magical training , the upcoming witchcraft test is coming 
Her eyes glittered dangerously behind rectangular eyes . 
By the fifth year we get a Regular Witch Doctor ! Dean Thomas exclaimed . 
Maybe not , Thomas , but believe me , the game needs to prepare everything necessary ! 
So far , only Granger was the only person in the class who turned the hedgehog into a pillow that I just met . 
I have to remind you , Thomas , is the pillow of the needle of the game is still curled up fear when someone stabbed a needle in it nhe ! 
Hermione blushed again , seemingly trying not to be too complacent . 
Harry and Ron were so happy that during the next prophet's session , Professor Trelawney told them they had reached the maximum point for their homework . 
She read a long passage in her prophecy , praising them for the attitude of welcoming the impending disaster . 
But they were less happy when she asked them to do one more post for the next month : both of them spent all their ideas on disaster . 
Meanwhile , Professor Binns , a ghost teaching History of Magic , presented them with a weekly essay on the eighteenth - century goblin revolts . 
Professor Snape started them studying the antidote . 
They do this very seriously , and he hinted that before Christmas , he would probably poison one of them to see if their antidote worked . 
Professor Flitwick asked the children to read three more books to prepare for the lesson on the Summoning Charm . 
Even old Hagrid added to the children a pile of work . 
The Tailed Shrike Monsters are growing at great speed although no one has yet found out what they eat . 
Hagrid was very happy , and as part of the project , he suggested that every day he went to his hut in the evening to observe the monsters and record their strange behavior . 
I will not come . 
Malfoy said bluntly as Hagrid suggested this with a Santa Claus gesture of taking a huge gift out of his pocket . 
Look at those crazy things in school is enough , thanks . 
The smile turned away from Hagrid's face , irritable , 
What do you do , or do not let me imitate Moody teacher said the game turned into a beautiful mink , Malfoy . 
The Gryffindor crowd laughed . 
Malfoy was angry but clearly the memory of Moody's punishment was still painful enough for him not to retaliate . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the school year , excited to see Malfoy humiliate Malfoy , especially since last year Malfoy had found all sorts of ways for Hagrid to get fired . 
Upon arriving at the lobby , they found it impossible to advance any further because a crowded crowd gathered there , rounding up a large table erected at the foot of a granite ladder . 
Ron , the tallest of the three , stood toe - to - toe with the front of his head and read aloud to the other two : 
TEST THE LEGAL TEST 
SCHOOL BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG SCHOOL WILL BE AT 6 AM OF FRIDAY , 30 OCTOBER . CLASSES WILL BE EARLY BEGINNING 
Great ! Harry screams , The poison layer is the last layer on Friday ! 
Snape did not have time to poison us ! 
PRACTICE ON BAGS AND BOOKS AT THE SLEEPING CIRCLE BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF DAYS BEFORE THE CALLING . 
Ernie Macmillan Hufflepuff out of the crowd , eyes sparkling : 
There's another week ! 
Do not know Cerdic already know ? 
Let me say it well 
Which Cerdic ? Ron was gone when Ernie was gone . 
Diggory Cerdic . Said Harry . How does it register ? 
Who is that Hogwarts champion ? 
Said Ron as he made his way through the crowd , heading for the stairs . 
Hermione argued : 
He's not a fool . 
You do not like him just because he beat Gryffindor in the Quidditch match . 
I heard that he is really a good student - and a leader too . 
She said in a way - like - free - table . 
Ron scoffed : 
She likes him just because he's handsome ! 
Hermione immediately , angry voice : 
Sorry , I did not like anybody just because he was handsome ! 
Ron pretends to be a cough , sounds like Lockhart ! strangely . 
The appearance of the panel in the vestibule has caused a significant effect on the entire population of the castle . 
For a week or so later , wherever he went , Harry seemed to have only one topic to talk about : the Magic Trial . 
Rumors fly from pupil to pupil like infectious germs : who will be the Hogwarts champion , how will it be played , how the Beauxbaton school students and other Durmstrang students 
Harry also noticed that the castle seemed to be undergoing a thorough cleansing . 
Some dirty portraits were cleaned up , very irritating to the characters in the picture , they were grasping in the frame , they would rather whisper and frown as they felt the naked face , blushes her . 
The armor was suddenly shiny , unmoving to an hour . 
The tutor Argus Filch behaved too violently to any student who forgot to clean his heels , so much so that he made the first two girls frightened to neuroticism . 
The members of the faculty also stress strange : 
Longbottom , please do not reveal that you can not play a simple swap in front of anyone at Durmstrang ! 
Professor McGonagall yelled at the end of a particularly difficult lesson , which Neville inadvertently implanted his ears into the cactus . 
When they came down to the breakfast room on the morning of October thirty , they found the hall was decorated the night before . 
Large silk banners strewn the walls , each representing a House : red with a lion Gryffindor , blue with a golden eagle Ravenclaw , yellow with a black lance the Hufflepuff , and the green with silver sprinkles are the Slytherins . 
Behind the teacher's desk , the largest banner with all the Hogwarts badges : lions , eagles , mezzanines , and snakes , all wrapped around a big H . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down beside George and Fred at the Gryffindor table . 
Again , and most abnormally , they separated from each other , away from the others and low - pitched . 
Ron went to the side . 
It's just a job . George grumbled to Fred . 
Okay , if the retired guy still does not talk to us individually , we ' ll send him a letter . 
Or do not put it in the hand . 
I can not avoid my face forever . 
Ron sat down next to his two brothers : 
Who avoided him so ? 
You must avoid the face is not help ! Fred said , annoyed by the incident . 
Ron asked George : 
What is the job then ? 
I have a boy or a nose like you ! George said . 
Harry asked : 
What do you think of the Triwizard Tournament ? Have you figured out how to register ? 
George bitterly said : 
He asked Miss McGonagall how to choose the champion , but he did not say so . 
He just told me to shut up , to worry about the transformation of the panda . 
Ron reckons : 
Do not know how many exams it ? 
Harry , you know , I bet we can do it too . 
We have done a lot of dangerous work 
Fred said , 
But at that time we did not do in front of the judges . 
McGonagall said that the champion would be given more points for the performance of the test . 
Harry wondered : 
Who on the jury ? 
Presidents of participating schools are always on the jury . 
Everyone turned to look at Hermione , quite surprised ; She continued : 
In the Trial of the Magical Trial in 1792 , all three judges were injured , when a parrot crowned with the champion to catch up . 
Hermione looked around and said , with a pensive expression that no one reads : 
This is in Hogwarts , A History . 
However , this book is not entirely reliable . 
The history of the revised Hogwarts is probably more accurate . 
Or a history of distilling and full of prejudice about Hogwarts : Critique of the worst aspects of school . 
What's more here ? Asked Ron , though Harry knew Ron was going to know what was going to happen . 
Said Hermione , flaming eyes : 
Ejaculate ! 
In the thousands of pages of Hogwarts , A History , there was not a single note that we were summarily interrogating hundreds of slaves ! 
Harry shook his head and finished eating his egg . 
Its lack of enthusiasm and Ron also did not prevent Hermione from resolutely equating equality with justice . 
In fact , both of them paid two Sickles to buy the badge H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
, but only to silence her . 
However , their Sickles were wasted : it seemed that they only made Hermione more vociferous . 
From there , she started harassing Harry and Ron , first grabbing two badges , and then convincing others to do the same , and Hermione began to pee in the common room every evening , Put people in the corner and then put the box to raise money near the nose . 
Said Hermione sharply : 
Have you noticed your bedclothes are changed , your fireplace is set fire , your classrooms are cleaned , your food is cooked , thanks to a group of mysterious creatures not paid and enslaved ? 
Some people , like Neville , for example , paid for Hermione not to scare her . 
Some people seemed to be slightly concerned about what she said , but hesitated to take a more active role in the campaign . Most of the rest is a joke . 
Ron rolled his eyes to the ceiling , now filled with the autumn sunshine , and Fred naturally focused on the smoked meat ( both twins refused to buy the badge ) . However , George leaning towards Hermione : 
Listen , have you ever been to the kitchen , Hermione ? 
Hermione murmured , 
No , of course not . 
I do not think students are allowed 
Oh , so we came down there ! 
George pointed at Fred : 
Down several times , to eat awkward . 
And when we met them , they were very happy . 
They think they have the best job in the world 
Hermione started harshly : 
That's because they are not civilized and have been brainwashed ! 
But her followers were sunk into a roaring noise above her head , signaling the letter had arrived . 
Harry looked up immediately , and saw Hedwig gliding toward it . 
Hermione immediately stopped talking , and Ron and Ron watched nervously as the owl landed on Harry's shoulder , reached for his feet , and stretched out tiredly . 
Harry pulled out Sirius's reply and gave Hedwig a piece of smoked bacon ; The owl immediately eats with a gratitude . 
Then , checking to make sure Fred and George were engrossed in the deeper talk about the Three Witches , Harry whispered to read Sirius's letter to Ron and Hermione . 
That's it , Harry 
I went home and hid . 
I want to send you letters or things that are happening at Hogwarts . 
Do not use Hedwig again , remember to always change , and do not worry about me , you worry about me . Do not forget what you told me about the scars . 
Sirius . 
Ron lowered his voice and asked : 
Why change ? 
Hermione said : 
Hedwig caught the attention . 
It floats too . 
A snow - white owl goes back to where he was hiding , he said , they are not birds in the area , right ? 
Harry rolled the letter and stuffed it in his cloak , wondering if he was less worried or anxious than before . 
He thought that Sirius managed to get back without being arrested was a very good thing . 
Nor did it deny that the thought that Sirius had come closer would make it more secure ; At least it does not have to wait too long each time he writes a reply to it . 
Thanks , Hedwig . he said as he stroked the owl . 
The owl snuggled up to sleep , ducked through Harry's unmoving cockpit , and took off , apparently not expecting much more than a long sleep in the stables . 
That day , a bustling atmosphere . 
No one focused on the work , only care about how many people from Beauxbaton and Durmstrang school will arrive this afternoon . 
Even the poison is easier to swallow than usual , also thanks to be out before half an hour . 
When the bell rings , Harry , Ron and Hermione return to Gryffindor Tower , take the pair and the book as instructed , put on the robes , and rush back down the hall . 
The instructor of the House instructs his pupils to stand in line . 
Mrs. McGonagall : 
Game Weasley , hats right . 
Patil , remove that ridiculous thing from your hair ! 
Parvati scowled at a decorated butterfly in the braid . 
Then McGonagall ordered : 
Come on , follow me . 
The first one goes ahead without shoving 
They walked down the stairs and stood in line in front of the castle . 
In the evening , the clear sky , the dew and the clear moon shone throughout the Forbidden Forest . 
Harry stood between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row , in the first , Dennis Creevey shuddered nervously . 
Ron watches the clock , looking out the path from the portal : 
Nearly six hours . 
What do you think they come from ? 
Train sure ? 
Probably not . Said Hermione . 
Harry looked up at the starry sky : 
So what ? 
Bust ? 
I do not think so far 
Said Ron : 
Or is the lock - port ? 
Or burgeoning ? 
Where are they allowed to be submerged under seventeen ? 
Angry Hermione : 
Can not say how many times you talked to Hogwarts ? 
They are excited on the black ground , but nothing moves . 
Everything is quiet , quiet , and quite normal . 
Harry started to feel cold . 
It may only be for those people to come quickly . Maybe foreign students must prepare for a dramatic break - up . Remember what Mr. Weasley said at camp before the World Quidditch Cup final : always - We never stop being loud when we meet . Suddenly from the back row , where the teachers stand , Dumbledore exclaimed : 
Ah , here it is ! 
Unless I'm too miserable , the Beauxbatons delegation is approaching ! 
Where ? The students shouted out loud , eyes full of impatience . 
A sixth year student of the forest : 
Look ! 
Something much larger , much larger than a broom - no more than a hundred broomsticks - was rumbling through the dark blue sky , toward the castle , growing in size . 
A first year screamed , completely lost composure : 
Oh ! 
Dragon ! 
Dennis Creevey scolded : 
Do not be crazy ! 
Dennis guessed close . When the giant black mass was flying over the trees of the Forbidden Forest and touching the light from the windows of the castle , they looked out over a giant chariot . Bordered by the size of a large house , they glided over their heads , being pulled by about a dozen golden horses in the air , with wings and large elephants . 
Three students in front of the back when the rickshaw rumbled landing , landing on the ground at a rate of horror ; Then , with a loud bang , Neville panicked and jumped back , pounding on the fifth leg of the Slytherin ; Horses , which are larger than the plate , touch the ground . 
A second later , the car landed on the giant wheels , while the golden horses shook their big heads and turned their red , big , fierce eyes . 
Harry just barely saw the door of the trailer with the badge ( two gold wands crossed , each with three stars ) , the door opened . 
A boy in a pale blue coat jumped down from the car , crouched forward , looking for something under the floor , and opened a whirlwind of gold . 
He jumped back respectfully . 
Then Harry saw a black , high - heeled shoe peeking out of the car - a baby sled - sized sled . 
Immediately afterwards , almost immediately , was the greatest woman she had ever seen in her life . This immediately explains the size of the car and the horses . 
Some of the children gap open mouth . 
For a moment in his life , Harry had only seen one as big as her , Hagrid ; He thought the two of them probably just moved a few inches apart . 
However , it may be because he is used to Hagrid - he sees this woman ( now standing at the foot of the stairs , looking around the crowd waiting to see ) seems to be unusually large . 
As she walked into the light from the Hall , her face was beautiful , with olive skin , black eyes , big eyes , watery eyes , and a slightly curved nose . 
Her hair was flushed out into a bunny glow . 
She was dressed from head to toe with black satin , and lots of shiny cat eyeglasses glittered on her neck and on her full mo . 
Dumbledore started to clap . 
The students , follow the tail , also began to pat , many toes to see this woman more clearly . 
Her face widened into a gentle smile as she walked toward Dumbledore , and she shook a glistening hand . 
Dumbledore , even though he was very tall , was only slightly inclined to kiss that hand . 
He said : 
Dear Maxime , welcome to Hogwarts . 
Mrs. Maxime replied , deep voice : 
Mr. Dumbly - Dorr , do not you ? 
Very well , ma ' am . Dumbledore said . 
Mrs. Maxime waved a giant hand behind her back . 
My pupil . 
Harry , who had been paying close attention to Maxime now , noticed that about a dozen sons and daughters , about seventeen and eighteen , got out of the car and stood behind Mrs. Maxime . 
They were not surprised , because the robes themselves seemed to be sewn with thin silk , and no one was wearing a coat . 
Some of them wrapped their scarves and scarves around their necks . 
From the stand , Harry could see them ( standing in Maxime's huge shadow ) staring up at Hogwarts Castle with a look on his face . 
Maxime asked : 
Was Karkaroff there yet ? 
Dumbledore said : 
He came right now . 
Would you like to wait for him here and welcome him , or would you like to be so warm in a little warmth ? 
I think , for warmth . 
Mrs. Maxime replied . But there are some dwarfs 
Dumbledore said : 
Our Paranormal Careers will be very pleased to take care of them . 
Soon he will come back here , dealing with a small situation with a few other things . 
Ron grinned , whispering to Harry : 
Shrimp . 
Maxime seems suspicious of some of the mystical orthodox caretakers who can afford this job : 
My war horses need to be strong . 
They are so eager 
Dumbledore smiled : 
I guarantee Hagrid will do well . 
Mrs. Maxime softly shrugged : 
Very good . 
He asked Agrid to admit that the seagulls were drinking pure zucchini . 
Dumbledore bowed too : 
Everything will be arranged . 
go ! Maxime spoke to his students in a commanding voice , and the Hogwarts crowd turned to her and her students to the stone . 
Seamus Finnigan leaned over to Lavender and Parvati to ask Harry and Ron : 
How do you think the Durmstrang horses will grow ? 
Harry said : 
Oh , if they were bigger than this , then Hagrid would be out of his mind . It is assumed that you have not been attacked by the Shrimp . 
Do not know what's wrong with them ? 
Ron said hopefully : " They must be in cages . " 
Hermione shuddered : 
Oh , do not say that . 
Imagine the monsters escaping from the tombs on the land 
We were standing there , shaking slightly , waiting for Durmstrang to come . 
Most look up to hope . 
It took a few minutes , the new silence was broken thanks to Maxime's horse , which was slightly swollen and sloppy . 
But then 
Do you hear anything ? Asked Ron suddenly . 
Harry listens . 
A loud , strange sound , bizarre from the darkness was flowing toward them . 
Stuttering sounds and sucking winds , as if a huge vacuum cleaner is moving on the riverbed 
Lee Jordan pointed down , exclaiming : 
Lake ! 
Look at the lake ! 
Standing from the ground looking through the parcel , they clearly see before the eyes is the black water surface calm , only the sudden water surface is not smooth at all . 
A stirring is taking place deep in the bottom of the lake : the great bubbles hatch on the surface , the waves bubbling on the muddy shore . 
And then , right in the middle of the lake , there was a whirlpool , as if someone unplugged a button in the middle of the lake . 
An object like a black and long pole slowly rising up in the middle of that vortex And then Harry saw the mast 
Sailboat ! She turned to Ron and Hermione . 
Slowly , beautifully , the ship rose out of the water , sparkling under the moonlight . 
Looks like a bizarre skeleton , like a wrecked boat reappeared ; and the shimmering , dim light emanating from the deck windows looks like ghost eyes . 
Finally , accompanied by a large muffled sound , the entire ship rose up , knelt on the drenched water , and began surfing to the shore . 
A few minutes later , the little girls heard a loud noise , an anchor being thrown into shallow water ; and a sound , a board is raised to the shore . 
People landed . 
They see the shadow passing by the light from the light from the deck window . 
Harry noticed that all of them had Crabbe's and Goyle's silhouette . But then , as they got closer , walking to the grass , stepping into the stream of light from the Hall , Harry saw that his stature was real . It's because they dressed in something like a fur - lined rug . 
Only the man leading the crowd toward the castle was wearing a different coat : the hairs were smooth and sparkling like silver . 
Dumbledore ! He stepped up , calling intimately . Are you not ? 
Healthy ? 
Thanks , Professor Karkaroff , as well as a thump ! said Dumbledore . 
Karkaroff has a sweet voice , pale . 
As he entered the light from the front doors of the castle , the young men found him as thin as Dumbledore , but his silver hair was short , and the goatee was curled up . small rolls can not cover all the curved chin . 
Stepping ahead to Dumbledore , he shook hands with both hands . 
Oh dear old school Hogwarts ! He said , looking up at the castle and smiling , yellow teeth , and Harry noticed his smile did not reach his eyes , it just stopped at the cold and deadly : 
Come back here feel how happy , how happy Viktor , go baby , go to warm Do not mind , Dumbledore brother ? 
Viktor has a slight feeling 
Karkaroff beckoned for one of his students . 
When the student walks past , Harry glances glimpses of the nose and black eyebrows . 
No need to wait for Ron to hiss or whistle into his ears , Harry can also recognize the face to look it : 
Harry - Krum ! 
CHAPTER 16 DAMAGE 
I can not believe it ! 
Harry , Krum ! 
Viktor Krum ! 
Ron was shocked when the Hogwarts students lined up the stairs , behind the Durmstrang disciples . 
Cried Hermione : 
Oh , Ron , he's just a Quidditch player ! 
Just a Quidditch player ! Ron looked at Hermione as if he could not believe his ears . Hey , Hermione , he's one of the hottest players in life ! 
I did not expect him to go to school ! 
As they returned to the Hall with their Hogwarts students entering the hall , Harry saw Lee Jordan jump up and down to see Krum's neck better . 
Many of his sixteen - year - old daughters were madly in their pockets as they passed by 
Oh , no , I do not have a hedgehog 
Do you think you have to sign on your hat with a lipstick ? 
So again ! Hermione said hoarsely as they passed by the girls , who were arguing over lipstick . 
Said Ron : 
If so , I will ask him for his signature . 
Do not you have any fur ? Harry ? 
No , in the bag upstairs . 
Said Harry . 
They went to the Gryffindor table and sat down . 
Ron carefully sat facing the door , as Krum and the Durmstrang students gathered around , seemingly wondering where to sit . Beauxbatons students chose their seats at the Ravenclaw table . 
They looked at the halls with sad faces . 
Three of the clowns wrapped their scarves around their heads . 
Said Hermione , annoyed . 
not so cold ! 
Why do not they wear a jacket ? 
Ron suddenly hissed : 
here 
Come sit here ! here 
Hermione , moved to the side of the place 
What ? 
Delayed ! Said Ron bitterly . 
Viktor Krum and Durmstrang pupils came to sit at the Slytherin table . 
Harry could see Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle looking very smug about it . 
Looking at Harry , Malfoy leaned forward to talk to Krum . 
Ron taunted : 
That's right , Malfoy , just take it easy . 
Krum fish will bore it right when not many people around the picture She thought they would sleep ? 
We can let them sleep in their room that Harry is willing to let him sleep on his bed , I sleep on the folding chair . 
Hermione snorted . 
Harry commented : 
They look more cheerful than the Beauxbatons . 
Durmstrang's pupil was taking off his heavy coat and looking up at the black - and - white ceiling , his face aroused . 
Two of them holding gold plates and gold cups to look at , seems very happy . 
At the teacher's desk , supervisor Filch was holding more chairs . 
He wears an old - fashioned tail - dress shirt . 
Harry surprised Filch by adding four chairs , two of them Dumbledore each . 
He wondered : 
Only two more ! 
Why are you up to four more , Filch ? 
Huh ? Ron replied dreamily . 
He was still staring at Krum . 
When all the students entered the Hall and settled down at the desks of the Houses , the new administration came in , rowing on the long table and sat down . The late Dumbledore , Professor Karkaroff , and Maxime . 
As soon as their principal appeared , the Beauxbatons students stood up . 
Some Hogwarts laughed . 
However , the Beauxbatons seemed unconcerned , and only sat down when Maxime was on Dumbledore's left . 
Dumbledore stood still , and there was a silence in the hall . 
He looked at foreign students , smiled : 
Greetings gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , and especially , guests . 
I am very happy to welcome all of you at Hogwarts . 
I hope and believe that you will be comfortable , have fun while staying here . 
A Beauxbatons daughter still nudges the scarf around her head giving a mocking laugh . 
Cried Hermione , whispering : 
No one will stop you ! 
Dumbledore continued : 
The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the party . 
Now I would like to invite you to eat , drink , and stay home . 
He sat down , and Harry saw Karkaroff immediately lean over to talk to him . 
The plates in front of the children as usual filled with food . The elf in the kitchen seems to have gotten out of gas : there are so many different dishes out in front of which Harry has never seen , including some sure foreign dishes . 
Ron pointed to a large plate of scallops standing next to a pudding - large nails including kidney and beef : 
What is that ? 
Bouillabaisse . ( Bui - bet - x , fish soup of Marseille , France , including many fish and shrimp , shellfish , snails with tomatoes , saffron pistils and spices ) 
Give up . Said Ron . 
Hermione explained : 
that's French . 
In summer I have eaten before the return . 
Very delicious . 
Ron took a piece of cake - black nails : 
I believe in you . 
The hall seemed more or less busy than usual , although there were only about twenty more students , but this could have been due to the different color uniforms that stood out when standing next to the block . black coat of Hogwarts . 
When they removed their fur , the new Durmstrang pupils revealed that they were wearing burgundy coats . 
Twenty minutes after the party began , Hagrid crept into the hall with the door behind the teacher's desk . 
He squeezed his place at the end of the long table and waved Harry , Ron , and Hermione with a heavy hand . 
Harry exclaimed : 
Weird monsters , Hagrid ? 
Hagrid replied cheerfully : 
Strong ! 
Ron quietly said : 
I also think they are strong . 
It seems they finally found the food they enjoyed ? 
Hagrid's fingers ! 
At that time , a voice said : 
Excuse me , are you still half bouillabaisse ? 
It was the daughter of the Beauxbatons who laughed when Dumbledore spoke . 
Finally , he also gave up his scarf . 
A long platinum hair fell down to the waist . 
She has big eyes , blue eyes and teeth , white . 
Ron's face was purple . 
He stared at her , gaping at his answer , without uttering a word other than the weak chanting . 
Well , take it , Harry said and pushed the plate to his daughter . 
Did you finish eating ? 
Ron almost breathless : 
Oh , great . 
The girl holding the plate and carefully put on the table Ravenclaw . 
Ron was still looking at her as if she had never seen a girl before . 
Harry laughed . 
Laughter seemed to pull Ron back . 
He said to Harry , his thick voice : 
That's a fairytale ! 
Said Hermione , 
Definitely not . 
I did not see anyone gasping and looking at him like a fool . 
But Hermione was not entirely right in this . 
When the girl walks across the Hall , many of the boys have to come back , some of them even seem to ban the pass , like Ron . 
I say , it's not a normal girl . 
Said Ron , leaning back to look at his daughter more clearly . 
At Hogwarts they do not produce any girls ! 
Harry thought to himself : 
At Hogwarts people produce a good girl or not ! 
Cho Chang inadvertently sitting just the other silver hair girl with chairs . 
Cried Hermione . 
If both of you are out of sight , you will see who is coming . 
She pointed to the teacher's desk . 
The two vacant seats are now occupied . 
Ludo Bagman was sitting on Professor Karkaroff's side , while Percy's head Crouch was sitting next to Mrs. Maxime . 
Surprised Harry : 
What are they doing here ? 
Hermione said : 
They are in the Organizing Committee of the Trial Chamber , right ? 
I guess they want to sit here and watch the game start . 
When the second batch of food arrived , they realized there were many fancy desserts . 
Ron carefully scrutinized a bizarre pale flan , then carefully pushed it to the right one by one , so that the Ravenclaw table could be seen clearly . 
However , the girl looked like the Fairy girl who seemed to have eaten so much , so she did not come to get the cake . 
When the gold plates were cleaned up , Dumbledore stood up again . 
There seemed to be a pleasant tension filled the hall . 
Harry felt trembled with excitement , wondering what was going on . 
Just a few chairs , Fred and George leaned forward , watching Dumbledore with high concentration . 
Dumbledore smiled at the sea of ​​ pupils raising their eyes : 
it's time 
The Magic Trial is about to begin . 
I want some explanation before we bring the chest of jewels 
Take what ? Whispered Harry . 
Ron shivered . 
We are committed to transparency in the process we will conduct this year . 
But first , let me introduce to those who do not know , said Bartemius Crouch , Head of International Cooperation for Magic . 
Some clap clap clapping . 
and Mr. Ludo Bagman , Head of Sport and Game of Magic . 
The applause for Mr. Bagman was bigger than that for Mr Crouch , apparently because of his reputation , or simply because he was more adorable . 
He accepted this with a cheerful wave . 
Bartemius Crouch did not waved his hand or smiled when he was named . 
Recalling him in his decent suit at the Quidditch World Cup , Harry found him quite strange in his sorceress robe . 
His whiskers and straight lines were a bit faintly rounded by Dumbledore's long beard and long white hair . 
Dumbledore continues : 
Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have been working tirelessly for the past few months to prepare for the Magic Trial . 
And they will be with Professor Karkaroff , Maxime , and I on the jury to evaluate the efforts of the champions . 
When it comes to the word ' champion ' , the attentiveness of the student body is beginning to sound more like it . 
As Dumbledore noticed the sudden silence of the young man , he smiled and said , 
The trunk of jewelry , then , brought in , Filch ! 
Filch , who had not noticed for a moment , was still standing in the far corner of the Hall , heading for Dumbledore , carrying a large wooden chest full of jewels . 
The chest is too old . 
A sudden whisper of suspense came from the students ; Dennis Creevey stood on the couch for a good look , but for too little of a head he could not get over the head . 
Dumbledore continued as Filch carefully placed the chest on the table in front of him : 
Instructions on the tests that the champions will have to do this year have been carefully reviewed by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman , and they have made the arrangements necessary for each challenge . 
There will be three tests , spanning the whole year , and will examine champions in various ways on magical skills , courage , reasoning , and , of course , the ability to confront the same danger . insurance . 
At the last word , the Hall was so quiet that no one seemed to be breathing . 
Dumbledore continued , calmly : 
As you know , there will be three champions in the competition , each coming from a participating school . 
They will be judged on how well each test is doing , and the champion who scores the highest score after the three exams will win the triumvirate trophy . 
The winners will be chosen by a fair judge : The Goblet of Fire . 
Dumbledore pulled out his wand and knocked three hours on the lid of the chest . 
The lid slowly opens to the cuckoo . 
Dumbledore reached inside , pulling out a harsh , wooden mug . 
No one would pay attention to the cup without a flaming blue - green flame reaching the glass's mouth . 
Dumbledore closed the chest and carefully placed the cup on the lid , from which the Hall could be seen . 
He said : 
Any game that wants to register as a champion must write his name and school clearly on a piece of parchment and drop it in the cup . 
Those who aspire to become champions will have twenty - four hours to submit their names . Tomorrow night , at the Ma ceremony , the cup will return three names of the three most deserving people to represent their school . 
The cup will be located in the lobby throughout the night , which is very convenient for those who want to try . 
To make sure that there is no age trapped , once the Cup of Fire is in the Hall , I will draw an Age around the cup . 
There will be no way under the age of seventeen . 
Finally , I would like to emphasize that with any game you want to compete in this competition , there is no superficial participation for fun . 
Once the cup has chosen the champion , he is obliged to follow along . Naming yourself in the cup also means signing a contract full of tied magic . 
And once you have been selected as the champion , you can not change your mind . 
Therefore , please ensure that the game is ready to play this game before dropping its name in the cup . 
Now I think of going to sleep . 
Have a good night . 
As the students dragged each other across the hall , through the door , into the lobby , Fred Weasley said , 
Realizing my age , I get poisoned . 
Once you get your name in the cup then spoiled for laughing , how he knows he is seventeen or not . 
Hermione said : 
But I do not think people under seventeen have any hope . 
We do not learn enough 
George said curtly : 
that's about you ! Harry , try it ? 
Harry thought quickly to Dumbledore's insistence that under 17 would not register , but the magical image of himself winning the Triple Trophy filled his mind . He wondered if Dumbledore would bother . How much do I have if a child less than seventeen dare to cross Age 
Where is he ? 
Ron looked blank . 
He did not even listen to the sound of the conversation , just looking at Krum where the crowd was . 
Dumbledore did not tell them that Durmstrang was sleeping , right ? But the question was answered almost immediately : they were at the Slytherin table , and Karkaroff just urged his students : 
Come back to the train . 
Viktor , how are you ? 
Have you eaten ? 
Do you need a kitchen to bring your children a warm wine ? 
Harry saw Krum shake his head and put on his coat . 
Dear professor , I want to drink wine . A Durmstrang schoolboy said , full of hope . 
Mr. Karkaroff shouted , the warmth of his father vanishing instantly : 
I did not invite you , Poliakoff . 
I noticed the game to drop the food down the jacket then , lychee 
Mr. Karkaroff turned and led the students toward the door , hitting Harry , Ron and Hermione right there . 
Harry stopped to let him pass . 
Thanks , Karkaroff said , his expressionless expression , his eyes glinting at Harry . 
Suddenly he stood dead . 
He turned his head and stared at Harry as if he could not believe his eyes . Durmstrang students behind their back . Karkaroff's eyes slowly moved up to Harry's face and glued to his scar . 
The students of Durmstrang also looked at Harry curiously . 
Just glancing at Harry also saw the burst appeared on their faces . 
The boy with the sticky food on his jacket , the girl next to him , stood white and pointed at the scar on Harry's forehead . 
A voice goes up behind them : 
Yes , that's Harry Potter . 
Professor Karkaroff turned around . 
Moody Eyes - crazy standing there , leaning against the cane , the magician's eyes glinting at the principal of Durmstrang . 
Harry looked up , seeing Karkaroff's face suddenly pale . 
A look of anger mixed with panic over him . 
You Karkaroff stared at Moody as if he was not sure if he was actually seeing him . 
I am here ! Moody cursed . Karkaroff , unless you have something to say to Potter , otherwise please avoid it . 
He is blocking the door . 
Indeed , half of the students in the hall were waiting behind them , looking over their shoulders to see what was causing the blockage . 
Without a word , Professor Karkaroff pulled his pupils away . 
Moody looked at him until he disappeared , his magician's eyes fixed on Karkaroff's back , an extremely hated look on his disfigured face . 
The next day is Saturday , usually most students will eat late . 
However , Harry , Ron and Hermione are not the only ones getting up earlier than every weekend . 
Down to the Hall , they 
About two dozen people were hovering around , some of them chewing on toast , while the other was looking at the Goblet . 
The cup in the middle of the hall , on the stool normally placed the hat Sorting . 
A small gold line is laid out on the floor , making a circle about three meters wide . 
Ron asked impatiently for a third daughter : 
Has anyone left the name yet ? 
She said : 
The crowd of Durmstrang . 
But I have not seen anyone on Hogwarts . 
Harry said : 
Dare to fish last night when we go to bed all , as well as some people to leave the name . 
If it was me , I would not do that to anyone . 
What if the glass spouted out ? 
Someone laughed behind Harry . 
Turn around , he saw Fred , George and Lee Jordan were hurrying down the stairs , all three looked extremely excited . 
Fred whispered triumphantly to Harry , Ron and Hermione : 
Done ! 
Just finished drinking ! 
What ? Asked Ron . 
Aging Aging , stingy guy . Fred said . 
Every one drops . George said , rubbing his hands together happily : " We just need to be older for months . 
Lee grinned . 
We will divide a thousand Galleons into three , if one of them wins . 
Hermione wary : 
I do not believe it works , you know that . 
I'm sure Dumbledore thought of this round . 
Fred , George and Lee did not pay attention to her . 
Fred said to the other two , trembling with excitement : 
Ready ? 
Come on , let's go first 
Harry looked fondly , seeing Fred take a piece of parchment from Fred Weasley's Hogwarts in his pocket . 
Fred went straight to the edge of the lane and stood there , jumping up and down as jumping athletes prepared for the fall of a hundred and fifty meters . 
Then , before everyone in the Hall of Fame rolled their eyes , it took a deep breath and crossed the line . 
In half an hour , Harry thought the drug was working . 
George definitely thinks so , because it exclaims a triumph and jumps in with Fred . 
But soon after , a hollow sound was heard , and the two men were knocked out of the gold ring , as if thrown out by an invisible thug . 
They fell to the ground , hurt , three meters away on the icy cold floor ; and for the sake of more humiliation , a loud scream , and then the two of them sprouted two long white beards that looked exactly the same . 
The hall shook with laughter . 
Fred and George also laughed , they stood up and this one was staring at the other's beard . 
You said before 
A deep , cheerful voice , and all came back to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the hall . 
Looking at Fred and George , eyes glares : 
I suggest you go to Mrs. Pomfrey . 
She is also taking care of Ravenclaw Fawcett , and Summers of Hufflepuff , both of whom have decided to grow old . 
However , he must say , no beautiful beard with the whiskers of two children . 
Fred and George went to the infirmary , accompanied Lee , laughed like crazy . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione both laughed , walking together . 
This morning , decoration in the hall has changed . 
As a festival of the Ma , a bent tree full of life swinging in the ceiling of the hall was spell , while hundreds of carved pumpkins stand glancing from every corner . 
Harry walks past Dean and Seamus , who are discussing which students in Hogwarts are seventeen ( or older ) can register . 
Dean said to Harry : 
There are rumors that Warrington got up early and left his name . 
That Slytherin guy looked exactly the same way . 
Harry , who had played Quidditch with Warrington , shook his head , 
We can not have a Slytherin champion . 
Seamus said contemptuously : 
All Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory . 
But I do not think that father wants to play the risk of beauty . 
Hermione cried out : 
Listen ! 
Everyone was laughing happily outside the Lobby . 
They all turned around and saw Angelina Johnson walking into the hall , smiling and embarrassed . 
The black Gryffindor Quidditch went to them , sat down and said , 
Hey , I'm done ! 
Just dropping the name . 
Ron looked amazed : 
Nostalgic joke ! 
Harry asked : 
Are you seventeen ? 
Said Ron : 
Of course , not the beard , huh ? 
I just ate a birthday last week . Says Angelina . 
Hermione said : 
Good , the Gryffindor house is registered . 
I really wish you were chosen , Angelina ! 
Thanks , Hermione . Angelina smiled at her . 
Damn , that's you , more than Nhoc pretty Diggory . Seamus said , making the Hufflepuffs go across the dashboard with his eyes on it . 
What are we doing today ? 
Ron asked Harry and Hermione as they finished breakfast and left the hall . 
Said Harry 
We have not been to Hagrid yet . 
okay . Ron agreed , as long as he did not show us how to donate his fingers to us . 
A glimpse of excitement appeared on Hermione's face , and she shouted happily : 
I thought I did not propose to Hagrid to join H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
Can you wait for me ? 
I ran upstairs to get some badges . 
What's wrong with it ? Ron asked as Hermione ran up the marble stairs . 
Suddenly Harry said : 
Hey , Ron , you friend 
Beauxbatons schoolmates from outside are passing through the front door , among them a fairy girl . 
The children gathered around the Fire Cup standing back to let us pass , looking eagerly . 
Mrs. Maxime walked into the hall , followed by her students and placed them in rows . 
Each of them , one by one , the Beauxbatons students crossed the age line and dropped the parchment into the blue - white flame . 
Whenever a name falls into the fire , it immediately turns red and sparks out . 
Ron whispered to Harry as the fairy dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire : 
What do you think will happen to those who are not chosen ? 
Do you think they will return to school , or stay in competition ? 
Harry replied , 
Do not know . 
Must stay Maxime to stay as judge , right ? 
When all the Beauxbatons students were enrolled , Maxime led them out of the hall , back into the yard . 
Where are they sleeping ? Said Ron as he walked out the front door , staring at us . 
There was a loud noise coming from behind them , signaling that Hermione was reappearing with a ducklings badge box 
Ron leaped down the stairs , his eyes unmoving , and Maxime was crossing the grass with Maxime : 
Oh , hurry up ! 
As they approached Hagrid's hut at the edge of the Forbidden Forest , the mystery of the Beauxbatons nightmare was answered . 
The blue jeep slept in the carriage two hundred yards ahead of Hagrid's house , and the students were climbing into the car . 
The horses flew like elephants the other day , grazing in the troughs to the side . 
Harry knocked on the door of Hagrid's hut . 
One of Fang's barkers responded immediately . 
New arrival ! Hagrid said as he opened the door . Forget you forgot ! 
Hermione said : 
We were busy , Hagr , but she was dead , looking up at Hagrid , almost banning him . 
Hagrid was wearing his brown , most beautiful ( and most horrible ) suit , knotting a yellow orange bell . 
But still not the worst ; Apparently he tried to tame his hair , using a large amount of stuff that looked like a grease wheel . 
Ear hair is now squeezed down into two bundles , perhaps he tried to tie the ponytail like Bill's hair , but found that too much hair , not finished . 
Appearance does not match with the old man at all . 
For a moment Hermione rolled her eyes , then decided to stop commenting , she said , 
How many monsters do not you ? 
Hagrid said happily , 
Outside the pumpkin garden . 
They are big , dare to be long . 
The only thing caught up in the meat again . 
really ? 
Hermione cried , throwing Ron a look of repression as he stared at Hagrid's bizarre hair , opening his mouth to say something about his hair . 
Hagrid said sadly : 
That's it , but it's okay . 
You gave them a box . 
About two dozen . 
Said Ron : 
That's lucky . 
Hagrid did not realize it made fun of him . 
Hagrid's hut had only one room , in the corner a huge bed spread with a patch of patches and patches . 
A great table and chairs stood in front of the fireplace , beneath a pile of smoked ham and dead birds hanging from the ceiling . 
The little girls sat at the table while Hagrid began to make tea , and soon they were all about the Trilogy . 
Hagrid seemed to be as excited as they were . 
He grinned : 
Wait , wait . 
You will see the masses never seen before . 
The first exam , but I was not told . 
Say it , Hagrid ! Harry , Ron and Hermione urged , but he shook his head , laughing : 
I do not want to make a few animals . 
But he said , spectacular . 
The championships are the same . 
Never thought he was alive but was considered playing the Magic Trial again . 
They finally left for lunch with Uncle Hagrid , though not much . 
Hagrid made what he called a stew pot , but after Hermione scooped up a huge bird's nail in his plate , the girl , Harry , and Ron ate well . 
However , they liked the idea of ​​ trying to tell Hagrid about the exams in the upcoming competition , considering who among the registrants would be chosen as champions , and ask each other whether Fred and George had fallen off the beard . . 
In the afternoon , a small rain began to fall . 
It was so warm when he was sitting by the fireplace , listening to the rain falling on the window , watching Hagrid talk to Hermione about the affair - because he had definitely refused to enter the company . CQLGT . 
When she gave him some badges . 
He said seriously , sewing with a huge hornbone , a long yellow thread : 
To be so cruel to them , Hermione ! 
The nature of them is caring people , they enjoy it , understand ? 
They took their jobs , they were sad . 
Paying them off is offensive to them . 
Hermione said : 
But Harry paid Dobby free , so he always came up ! 
And we've heard that it now demands a salary ! 
Yes , yes , there is no exception . 
You do not say that there are no eccentric elves who want freedom , but I can not convince most of them to do that , do not do anything . 
Hermione . 
Frankly , Hermione looked angry , she stuffed the badge into her coat pocket . 
At around five - thirty , Ron , Harry and Hermione decided to return to the castle to celebrate the Ma ceremony , and , more importantly , to hear the announcement of each school's champion . 
Said Hagrid , throwing the pieces aside . 
Uncle to go together . Wait a second ! 
He got up , to the drawer next to the bed , looking for something . 
The little ones do not pay much attention until a really horrible odor hits the nose . 
With coughing , Ron cried out : 
Uncle Hagrid , what is it ? 
Huh ? 
Do not like it ? Hagrid turned to a large bottle in his hand . 
Asked Hermione , chokingly . 
Do not shave the shaver ? 
Mouth watering . Hagrid blushed , murmuring . 
Then he said curtly : 
It's a bit hard . Let the wipe off , wait for it 
He trudged out of the hut , and they saw him scouring in a bucket of water outside the window . 
Said Hermione , in astonishment . 
Perfume ? 
Hagrid used perfume ? 
Harry low voice : 
What about the hair and the suit ? 
Ron exclaimed , pointing out the window : 
Look ! 
Hagrid just stood up and turned around . 
If he had blushed in the past , he would not be able to do anything at all . 
Tiptoeing away , Harry , Ron and Hermione peeked through the window and saw Mrs. Maxime and the Beauxbatons students coming out of the wagon , obviously going to the party . 
They did not hear what Hagrid was saying , but he was talking to Maxime with a happy and dreamy face that Harry had seen only once since - when he looked at the little dragon Norbert . 
Said Hermione , 
He came to the castle with her ? 
But I thought he was waiting for us ! 
Without glancing back to his hut halfway , Hagrid slowed his footsteps with Maxime across the ground , following the Beauxbatons disciples , to run on their giant strides . 
Ron : 
He liked it ! 
Well , if they had children at all , they would also break the world record - dare any child weighing a ton . 
They get out of the hut and shut the door . 
The outside was surprisingly dark . 
Wearing their slacks tighter , they started climbing the steep slope grass . 
Oh , they are , look ! 
Hermione whispered . 
From the lake , the Durmstrang walk towards the castle . 
Viktor Krum next to Karkaroff , the other Durmstrang behind , disconnected . 
Ron looked at Krum excitedly , but , when he reached the door Krum did not look around , he walked in front of Harry , Ron and Hermione had a little straight and straight through them . 
When the crowd looked up , the candle - lit hall was almost full . The Goblet of Fire was removed , now facing Dumbledore's vacant chair and teacher's desk . 
Fred and George - now that he has cleaned his beard back - have accepted the disappointment pretty well . 
Fred said as Harry , Ron and Hermione sat down : 
Hope it is Angelina . 
Said Hermione gasp : 
Me too ! 
Yes , I know right away ! 
The Hoi Ma party seems to be much longer than usual . 
Maybe it was a second party in two days . 
Harry does not seem to be as hungry as ever . 
Like all the other people in the Hall , the constant smirk , the same impatient face , restless standing up to see if Dumbledore had finished eating , 
Harry simply wants the plates to be cleaned up , and to hear who was chosen as the champion . 
Finally , the gold plates returned to their original purity , and the noise level rose sharply throughout the Hall and collapsed as soon as Dumbledore stood up . 
The two sides , Professor Karkaroff and Mrs. Maxime look as stressful and full of suspense as anyone . 
Ludo Bagman laughed and winked at the students . 
However , Mr. Crouch looked rather indifferent , somewhat bored . 
Dumbledore said : 
Finished , the glass is almost ready to be judged . 
I figured it would take more than a minute . 
Now that the names of the champions have been announced , I would like to ask them to go straight to the top of the hall , walk along the teacher's desk , straight to the next room and then point the door behind the tables of the professors : 
That is where they will receive the first instruction . 
He pulled out a wand and scuffed a large one . 
Immediately , all the candles except the lit candles in the pumpkins fell off , all in the darkness . 
Now there is nothing in the Hall of Fame with the Goblet of Fire . 
Its bluish white sparks glow , lacking in the eye . 
Everybody look , wait Some people watch the clock 
Lee Jordan sat two chairs from Harry , whispering : 
Coming soon ! 
Suddenly , the fire inside the glass turned red . 
Sparks scatter . 
A moment later , a tongue burned out a piece of parchment that was almost coal . 
The room sounded like a scream . 
Dumbledore picked up the parchment and took it far away so that he could read it with the light of the fire , which was now back to white . 
Readable , clear voice : 
Durmstrang's champion , Viktor Krum ! 
No surprises ! Ron screamed as a storm of applause and cheers spread throughout the hall . 
Harry saw , from the Slytherin table , Viktor Krum got up and hunched toward Dumbledore , turned right , walked down the teacher's desk , and disappeared into the door of the next room . 
Mr. Karkaroff said loudly , so that everyone could hear , even applause : 
Hooray , Viktor , know how I was chosen ! 
The applause and the screams diminished . 
Now everyone's attention is focused on the cup , when , a few seconds later , it turns red again . 
A second parchment was flicked out by the flames . 
Dumbledore shouted : 
Beauxbatons champion , Fleur Delacour ! 
That's it , Ron ! 
Harry exclaimed as the fairytale girl rose up lovingly , threw her platinum hair back and forth across the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuff . 
Oh , look , the whole crowd was disappointed ! 
Said Hermione in the crowd , nodding toward the remaining Beauxbatons . 
Harry thought , disappointment is a bit light . 
Two of the girls did not pick up crying , head collapsed into the arm . 
When Fleur Delacour also disappeared into the room on the side of the hall , once again the silence was over , but this time it was a hard silent echo that everyone could feel . 
Hogwarts ' next success is 
The fire glow turns red again ; sparks flew to the fence , the tongue of fire licked up into the air , and from the top of that tongue Dumbledore pulled out the third parchment . 
The chorus : 
Hogwarts champion , Cerdic Diggory ! 
Are not ! Ron yelled , but no one heard it , except Harry . 
The roar from the next table is too big . 
All the Hufflepuffs jumped up , screaming and stamping as Cerdic passed them , smiling brightly , heading for the room behind the teacher's desk . 
Indeed , the applause for Cerdic lasted so long that it took a while for everyone to hear Dumbledore's words . 
Excellent ! The happy man said when the chaos finally settled down . Finished , now we have three champions . 
I'm sure I can get all of the games , including the rest of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students , to give their champions their every penny . 
By continuing to encourage your champion , you will contribute to one 
But Dumbledore stopped speaking , and everyone clearly saw what had made him so distracted . 
The flame in the glass is red again . 
Sparks emitted . 
A tongue of fire suddenly shot into the air , carrying a piece of parchment over him . 
Apparently , completely automatic , Dumbledore reached out his long arm and grabbed a piece of paper . 
He opened it and looked at the name written on it . 
There was a long silence , while Dumbledore was still staring at the piece of paper in his hand , and everyone in the room was staring at him . 
Finally , Dumbledore cleared his throat , reading : 
Harry Potter . 
CHAPTER 17 THE FATHER OF THE FOURTH FATHER 
Harry sat there , knowing that every head in the hall was turning to look at him . 
It stunned , stunned . 
He felt dumbfounded . 
He must be dreaming . 
It must have been mistaken . 
Not a clap . 
A faint , as if an angry bee , slowly filled the hall ; Some of the students stood up to look at Harry more clearly ; he sat there , hard , in the chair . 
At the top of the table , Professor McGonagall stood up , passing Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff , to the emergency room with Professor Dumbledore , who tilted his ear towards her , frowning slightly . 
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione ; Over his shoulders , he saw Gryffindor's long table , staring at him , his mouth open . 
Harry said sternly : 
I did not give up my name . 
You know you do not leave . 
They both looked at Harry . 
At the head of the table , Professor Dumbledore stood up straight , nodding one to Professor McGonagall . 
Call again : 
Harry Potter ! 
Harry ! 
Come on , come on ! 
Come on , Hermione whispered , gently pushing Harry one by one . 
Harry stood up , treading his shirt , slipping a little . 
He walked along the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables . 
It felt like this was an endless journey , never closer to the table above , and it could feel hundreds , hundreds of eyes looking up at it , each eye as a lamp . so illuminated . 
The sound is louder and louder . 
After an hour or so of thought , it stood in front of Dumbledore , feeling every look at all the teachers glued to him . 
Come out the door , Harry . Dumbledore said . 
You do not laugh . 
Harry walked along the teacher's desk . 
Hagrid was at the last minute . 
He did not wink at Harry , waving his hand , not making any greetings to him as usual . 
Hagrid looked completely stunned , only staring at Harry as he passed by like everyone else . 
Harry crossed the door , came out of the hall , and found himself standing in a smaller room , hanging out with his paintings , the witch . 
In front of him was a large fire burning in the fireplace . 
The faces in the portraits turned to look at it as it stepped in . 
He sees a dry witch flying gently out of the picture frame , slipping into the next frame , including an old witch whiskers . 
The witch began to whisper into this old man's ear . 
Viktor Krum , Cerdic Diggory and Fleur Delacour are gathering around the fireplace . 
They look amazing , very impressive , with the shadow over the fire . 
Krum , hunched and groggy , leaned toward the fireplace , slightly apart from the other two . 
Cerdic stood behind us , staring into the fireplace . 
Fleur Delacour was looking around for a moment as Harry pulled back , throwing his long silver hair back : 
What's up ? Who are the proud people in this Salute ? 
He thought this kid was very informative . 
Harry does not know how to explain what has just happened . 
He stood there , watching the three champions , feeling a bit tall , how tall they were . 
The footsteps echoed behind Harry , and Ludo Bagman walked into the room . 
He grabbed Harry's arm , pulled forward , whispered , squeezed his biceps : 
Super ! 
Skill ! 
Ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen 
He walked over to the fireplace and said to the other three : 
Let me introduce - maybe this is an unbelievable thing - the fourth champion of the Triple Struggle . 
Viktor Krum straightened up . 
Her irritated face darkened as she watched Harry . 
Cerdic looks confused . 
He looked over at Mr. Bagman and looked at Harry , then looked at Mr. Bagman , as if convinced he had heard what Bagman had said . 
Fleur Delacour , however , flicked her hair and said , 
Oh , that's funny , Bagman ! 
Mr. Bagman said , bewildered : 
Kidding ? 
No , no , not at all . 
Harry's name comes from the Goblet ! 
Krum's black eyebrows slightly frowned . 
Cerdic still looks confused politely . 
Fleur grimaced , he spoke softly to Mr. Bagman : 
But the sting is wrong It can not play , too tight ! 
Mr. Bagman said , rubbing his chin and laughing at Harry : 
Well , that's amazing . But , as you know , this year's age restrictions are just another safeguard measure . I mean , I do not think I've come to this country yet deserted . Follow the law that must follow Harry to try to do it 
The door behind them opened again , and a large crowd entered : Professor Dumbledore , followed closely by Crouch , Professor Karkaroff , Maxime , Professor McGonagall , and Professor Snape . 
Before Professor McGonagall closed the door , Harry heard the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall . 
Fleur ran to her principal , saying immediately : 
Mrs. Maxime ! They said that this guy is also playing ! 
somewhere in his heart Harry was drenched in anger : Baby boy ? 
Maxime stretched out , high up . 
Her beautiful head swept into the candle - lit chandelier , and her great black satin breast was swollen . 
She asked , her voice imperious : 
Mr. Dumbly - dorr , what is this ? 
I would like to know that , Mr. Dumbledore . 
Mr. Karkaroff interjected . 
He hugged a cold steel - eyed , two dark - green eyes like ice cubes : 
Hogwarts champion ? 
Did not anyone say to me that the host school was allowed two championships , or did I read the rules carefully enough ? 
Then he laughed at the harsh , hateful laugh : 
C ' est impossible , Ogwarts could not even have two champions . 
This is not fair . Mrs. Maxime said , her huge hand clad in a beautiful cat eye on Fleur's shoulder . 
Karkaroff still smiled coldly , but his eyes were colder than ever : 
And do we think that his Age will drive out younger opponents , Dumbledore ? 
Of course , if not then we have brought more rivals from school ! 
Mr. Karkaroff , that's not someone's fault , but Potter's fault . Snape said softly . 
His eyes light up maliciously . Do not blame Dumbledore for Potter's determination to break the law . 
Ever since he came here , he has learned to cross the dirt 
Thank you Severus . 
Dumbledore said curtly , and Snape shut up , though his eyes were still raspy after the shiny black hair . 
Dumbledore looked down at Harry . 
He was looking straight into the eyes , trying to find out what the view behind the glasses half the moon wanted to describe . 
Quoted : 
Did you leave my name in the goblet , Harry ? 
Are not . Said Harry . 
It is well known that people are looking at it without leaving their eyes . 
From the dark corner , Snape gave a small , boring sound , out of patience . 
Professor Dumbledore pretended not to hear Snape , he asked , " Do you have any bigger games than give your name to Gorman ? 
are not ! Said Harry firmly . 
Of course she was talking , Mrs. Maxime said . 
Snape shook his head , his lips curled . 
Professor McGonagall said , steel accent : 
She can not overcome the age shake . 
I'm sure we all agree 
Maxime shrugged : 
On Dumbledore - Dorr , there must be something wrong with the line . 
Of course , it is possible . Dumbledore said politely . 
Professor McGonagall angrily : 
Mr. Dumbledore , you know he did not do anything wrong ! 
Indeed , it is ridiculous ! 
Harry himself was not able to overcome the Age , and Professor Dumbledore certainly did not convince a large pupil to do it for Harry . 
I think , so what else do you want ? 
Then she threw a glance at Professor Snape . 
Mr. Karkaroff , once again , took on the slippery voice : 
Mr. Crouch Mr. Bagman you are objective judges . 
Do you agree that this is the most illegal ? 
Mr. Bagman wiped the round face like a son's face with a handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch . 
He stood outside the ring , his face half hidden in the dark . 
He looked a bit bizarre , the light was dim so he looked much older , looking almost like a skull . 
However , when he said that , it was still a stiff voice : 
We have to follow the law , and the law has indicated that those who have been fired from the Goblet of Fire will have to fight in the fight . 
Yes , Mr. Barty is in the law ! Mr. Bagman said with a beaming smile , turning back to Mr. Karkaroff and Mrs. Maxime , as if the matter was closed . 
But Mr Karkaroff said : 
I asked to be re - registered again . 
Now he threw his slippery voice and smiled . 
Indeed , his face became even worse : 
You have to put up the Fire again , and we will continue to add names , until each school has two champions . 
So fair , Dumbledore ! 
Mr. Bagman dismissed : 
But Mr. Karkaroff , can not do that ! The goblet is gone , and it will not burn again from here until the start of the next competition . 
The Durmstrang School will not be involved ! Mr Karkaroff exploded . After all the meetings , negotiations and agreements , I was slightly suspicious that something like this would happen ! 
Now I want to leave here ! 
do not scare Karkaroff . a voice growled near the door . He can not give up his champion again . 
He must play . 
All have to fight . 
As Dumbledore has said , a contract of magic tie advantage ? 
Moody entered the room . 
He hummed toward the fireplace , and each time he took the right foot , there was a sound . 
Karkaroff says : 
Advantage ? 
I'm afraid I do not understand you , Mr. Moody . 
Harry could say that Karkaroff was trying to be contemptuous , as if what Mr. Moody had said was not worth listening to , but the hands had accused him : they were two fists . 
Moody says quietly : 
Do not understand ? 
Very simple that Karkaroff . 
Someone had put Potter's name in the cup , knowing that if the mug would release the boy's name , it would have to be played . 
Maxime exclaimed : 
That is to say , some people wanted to have the Ogwarts school doubled . 
Karkaroff folded herself before her : 
I totally agree , Mrs. Maxime . 
I will send a proposal to the Ministry of Magic and the International Witch Association 
Moody roared : 
If anyone has a reason to make a recommendation , then that is Potter . 
But honestly I do not hear the word complaining to a word 
Fleur Delacour stomped , bursting : 
Why is it recommended ? 
Is it a chance to compete ? 
While we keep chewing , we can not get through this week ! 
Honor for the school , then a thousand dollars of money - is full of the occasion how many willing to die to be ! 
There may be some who hope Potter is willing to die . Moody hissed through her teeth . 
After those words , a silent and stifling silence envelops . 
Mr Ludwig Bagman , now looking really anxious , clicked on the door and said , 
Oh my old man Moody you say so ! 
Karkaroff's mouth : 
We still know that Professor Moody is the kind of person who thinks one morning is thrown out if , before lunch , no six conspirators are found . 
Obviously , he is teaching his students to be fearful of assassinations . 
Anti - Artistic Dark Arts teacher . 
But , Dumbledore , I'm sure you have a reason . Moody growled : 
Imagine everything ? 
Is that so ? 
I have an illusion ? 
Only a sorcerer or a tall witch could throw a guy into a cup 
Ah , where are you ? Mrs. Maxime raised her huge hands . 
Mr. Moody says : 
Because they have overcome a very powerful magic object . 
There must be a very strong Absorber for that cup to forget that there are only three participating schools . I guess they registered the name Potter under a fourth school , to make sure it was the only one in the league . like it 
Karkaroff coldly : 
You're thinking too much , Moody . 
And how cool is the new hypothesis , even though I heard that he was just one of his birthday presents containing a cleverly disguised hammer , and he crushed the package . Presenting it in pieces , before realizing it was a pocket watch . 
So please be sympathetic if we do not completely listen to him seriously 
Moody thumped in a threatening tone : 
There are those who turn these harmless occasions into their advantage . 
Mr. Karkaroff , my job is to think of a way the dark witches do , please remember 
Alastor ! Dumbledore exclaimed , warning . 
Harry wondered what it was like for him to say something , but it suddenly broke , right , Crazy Eye could not be Moody's . 
Moody was silent , though still looking at Karkaroff , Karkaroff's face flushed . 
Dumbledore told everyone in the room : 
Why do we fall into this situation , we do not know . 
However , for me , we have no choice but to accept it . 
Both Cerdic and Harry were selected to compete in the competition . 
Therefore , they must 
Ah , but Dumbly - dorr 
My great Maxime , if you have any alternative , I would like to hear it ! 
Dumbledore waited , but Maxime did not say anything , just glared at him . 
It's not just you . 
Snape looked furious , Karkaroff angry ; However , Mr. Bagman looked quite excited . 
He rubbed his hands together and smiled around the room : 
Finished , will we continue ? 
Should we guide our champions ? 
Mr. Barty , want to do this honor ? 
Mr. Crouch seems to have just come out of his dream : 
Well instructed to take the test first 
He stepped forward , standing in the bright spot of the fireplace . 
Looking closely , Harry thought he looked sick . 
A dark circles under the eyes and wrinkled skin that the Quidditch Cup did not have . 
He spoke to Harry , Cerdic , Fleur , and Viktor . 
The first test is to test your courage , so we will not tell you what that is or what it is . 
Giving up on what you do not know is a very important virtue of the sorcerer . The first test will take place on November 24 , before all the students and judges . 
To complete the exams of the competition , the champions will not be allowed to request or approve any kind of help from the teachers . To face the first test , the champions will only be equipped with wand . 
They will receive further information about the second test when the first test ends . 
Because the nature of the game is time consuming and demanding , the champions will be exempt from the end of the year . 
Mr. Crouch turned to Dumbledore : 
I think so , Albus . 
I think so . said Dumbledore . 
He looked anxiously at Mr. Crouch : 
Do not you want to stay in Hogwarts tonight , Barty ? 
No , Dumbledore , I have to go back to the Ministry . 
Very busy , very difficult I had to let the young Weatherby stay on the job is too enthusiastic enthusiasm , if you have to say the truth 
Dumbledore suggested : 
Or at least make a cup before going ? 
Mr. Bagman said happily : 
Come on , Barty , I'm staying here ! 
Everything that's going on in Hogwarts is more interesting now than in the bureau , you know ! 
I do not think so , Ludo , Mr. Crouch said , a little impatient . 
Dumbledore asked : 
Professor Karkaroff Mrs. Maxime made a cup before going to bed ? 
But Maxime wrapped her arm around Fleur's shoulder and led her out of the room . 
Harry heard them talking in French when they entered the hall . 
Mr. Karkaroff motioned for Krum , and then , in turn , went out in silence . 
Harry , Cerdic , I suggest you go to bed . 
Dumbledore said with both of them laughing : 
You are sure the Gryffindor and the Hufflepuffs are waiting to congratulate you , and it is a shame to deprive them of the great reason to have a good laugh . 
Harry glanced at Cerdic , who nodded , and they both came out . 
hall is now quiet . 
The creeping candles make the jagged smiles of the pumpkin crowd set up , strange . So we have to fight again ! 
Cerdic said with a slight smile . 
I guess so then 
Said Harry . 
It does not think of anything to say . 
Inside his head seemed to be very messy , just like his brain was crushed . 
Upon reaching the Lobby - only torches were replaced for Fire , Cerdic said : 
Come on , tell me , do you leave my name anyway ? 
I do not quit . Said Harry , glaring at Cerdic . I do not give up . 
I say it . 
Well , see you later , Harry . Said Cerdic . 
Harry dares to bet he does not believe it . 
Instead of going up the marble stairs , Cerdic went to the big door . 
Harry stood there , listening to the footsteps Cerdic went down to , and slowly , it began to climb the stone stairs . 
Is there anyone besides Ron and Hermione who believes it ? 
Or do the other two also think that he's left his name alone to compete ? 
How can anyone think of this , when it faces the same opponents over it three - year school magic , when it faced the test not only hear the danger , It also has to perform in front of hundreds of people . yes it was thinking of it It was dreaming about it but it was a dream , a joke for fun but it never seriously thought about signing up 
But somebody has thought of this , someone wants it to step into the fight , and make it inferior . 
Why ? to play it ? 
It does not think so , anyway 
Or is it supposed to be an idiot ? 
If so then that person is satisfied then 
But if it was killed ? 
Is it the inherent mistrust of Moody ? Would anyone drop the name Harry into the cup just to play it ? 
Or does someone really want to die ? 
Harry could answer that immediately . 
Yes , somebody wants him to die when he is one year old . Lord Voldemort . 
But how did Voldemort secure Harry's name in the Goblet ? 
Voldemort must have been far away , in a remote village , lonely and lonely 
But in the dream that he dreamed the day before , just before he woke up with a painful scar , Voldemort was not alone talking to the worm's tail plan to kill Harry . 
Harry was shocked to see that it was standing in front of her Don was not good . 
She did not notice where her legs were going . 
It was amazing to see she was not alone in the frame . 
The witch snapped up at her neighbor's picture , when Harry entered the championship under the house , 
Now I sit next to Mrs. Beo . 
She had rushed past the seven stairs to get here before it . 
Both her and Mrs. Dow looked down at him with a pensive expression : 
Hey , this , this ! 
Violet told me the story . 
Who has been selected as a military champion ? 
Three three . Harry stuttered . 
The perverse witch intervenes : 
Definitely not ! 
No , no , because , that's the password . 
Mrs. Beo gently said and then tossed aside the edge of the picture for Harry to go into the common room . 
Noise to the ears when the portrait opened again echoed Harry back . 
Then he noticed that he was jostling inside the common room with about two dozen hands , followed by the Gryffindors , shouting , applauding , and whistling . 
Should I give this to you or you register ? Fred roared , looked half - angry , half - admired . 
George roared : 
How can you do without having a beard ? 
Extremely smart ! 
I did not register , Harry said . I do not know why 
But Angelina came up with : 
Oh , if it was not you , then at least Gryffindor 
Katie Bell , another Gryffindor hunter , shouted : 
You have the opportunity to take revenge on Diggory Quidditch before , Harry ! 
Have some food , Harry , come here to eat 
I'm not hungry , eat enough party 
But no one wants to hear that he is not hungry , no one wants to hear that he has not left his name in the cup , no one seems to notice it is completely unhappy to celebrate Lee Jordan pulled out in the crook There was a Gryffindor banner , and it was insisted on wrapping around Harry like a robes . 
Harry could not escape , whenever he tried to walk up the stairs leading up to the bedroom , the crowd around him shrugged , squeezing it with an extra butter , adding more potato chips or peanuts to his hands . Everyone wants to know how it was done , how it fooled Dumbledore's Age and managed to get his name out of the cup . 
It must say again and again : 
I do not do that . 
I do not know how it happened . 
But because nobody noticed , it was as if he had not answered anything . 
Finally , after nearly half an hour , he shouted : 
I'm tired . 
No , seriously , George I'm going to bed 
He did not want anything more than to make Ron and Hermione , make a little sober , but did not find any in the living room . 
Just insist that you need to go to bed , and almost have to cover the two brothers Creevey when they ambushed at the foot of the stairs , Harry ruffled the crowd around and climbed into the bedroom fast . 
As he fell , Ron found himself lying on the bed , in the empty bedroom , still in fine clothes . 
Ron looked up at Harry slamming the door . 
What time are you ? Asked Harry . 
Hello ! Said Ron . 
Ron smiled , but it was a strange smile . 
Harry realized that he was still wrapping up the Gryffindor banner that Lee had wrapped around his body . 
He rushed off , but the banner was too tight . 
On the bed , Ron lies unmoving , looking at Harry struggling with the banner . 
Finally , when Harry unbuckled the banner and threw it to the corner , Ron said , 
Wow ! Congratulations . 
Harry looked at Ron , 
What do you say ? 
Congratulations ? 
Obviously there was something wrong with Ron's smile . 
That's more like a grin than a laugh . 
Said Ron : 
Oh no one passed the Age . 
No one , including Fred and George . 
What are you using ? Invisibility cloak ? 
Harry slowly : 
Invisibility also does not help overcome the line . 
Said Ron : 
So , I thought you would tell me if you were wearing an invisibility cloak because it could cover both of you , right ? 
But in the end , it turns out you used it differently , huh ? 
Listen , I did not leave my name in the cup . 
Someone has done this . 
Ron raised his eyebrows : 
What do they do ? 
Harry said : 
I do not know . 
He saw say : to kill himself ! it seems too serious . 
Ron raised his eyebrows so high that his brows almost disappeared in his hair . 
It says : 
Hey , you know , you can tell me the truth if you do not want anyone else to know , easy , but I do not understand why you have to lie , you do not have trouble for this case , right ? are not ? 
Mrs. Béo's friend , Mrs. Violet , told all of us that Dumbledore had given her registration . 
Thousands of Galleons do not set , right ? 
And you do not have to take the final exam again 
Harry starts to feel mad : 
I did not drop my name in that cup ! 
All right , Ron used Cerdic's skeptic tone . 
Only this morning you said if you were you did last night so that no one would see I was not stupid , you know . 
Harry snapped back : 
Do that again pretty much ! 
What ? Ron said , his face was not a smile , though he smiled . You want to go to bed , Harry . 
I guess you should get up early tomorrow morning to give you pictures or something else ! 
Then he jerked the curtain up , letting Harry stand at the door , staring at the red velvet curtain , now covering one of the very few people he'd ever believed would trust it . 
Chapter 18 BALANCE 
When Harry woke up Sunday morning , it took a moment to remember why he felt miserable and anxious . 
Then the memory of the night before was in Harry's mind . 
He sat up , pulled the curtain around his four - poster bed , was about to talk to Ron , to force Ron to believe it . But he noticed Ron's bed was empty ; Ron must have gone downstairs to eat breakfast . 
Harry dressed up and climbed down the stairs to twist into the common room . 
When it came out , those who had eaten their breakfasts cheered . 
The prospect of going down to the hall to meet the remaining Gryffindor pupils , leaving them treated like a hero , makes Harry falter . 
However , either it had to deal with it , or it had to stay in the common room to be surrounded by the Creevey brothers , who were eagerly begging Harry to join them . 
Harry went straight to the portrait hole , pushed it open , climbed out , and found herself facing Hermione . 
Hermione was holding a napkin wrapped in a bunch of toast . 
She raised the package , said : 
Hello ! 
Take this for you Do not want to walk ? 
Said Harry in a grateful voice : 
This is a good idea ! 
They went down the stairs , quickly crossing the Hall , without looking at the infamous hall , and then strode across the lawn toward the lake where the Durmstrang's ship was anchored . The shadow of the ship reflected black underwater . 
It was cold that morning , as they walked and chewed on toast , Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after she had left Gryffindor's table the night before . 
It was a great relief to see Hermione accepting her story without questioning . 
When she finished telling the scene in the room outside the hall , she said , 
Of course I know you did not register yourself . 
Look at your face when Dumbledore called you names ! 
But the question is , who has signed up for you ? 
By Harry , Moody is right . I do not think any student is capable of doing that . They can not fool the cup or pass Dumbledore 
Harry interrupts Hermione : 
Do you see Ron ? 
Hermione hesitated : 
Oh it's in the breakfast room . 
Do you think you can register yourself ? 
Confused Hermione : 
No , I do not think so 
What does ' not really ' mean ? 
Hermione said desperately : 
Oh , Harry , do not you understand ? 
Ron envy that ! 
Harry asked again : 
Jealousy ? 
Jealousy what ? 
Does he also want to be a fool in front of the whole school ? 
Hermione patiently explained : 
So , Harry , you are always attracting attention , you know this . 
Harry gasped in anger , and Hermione immediately said , 
I know that's not your fault . 
I know you do not ask for it but you know that , at home Ron has a bunch of brothers to compete , you're his best friend , and you're so famous . Every time I see you , and it tries , it never says it , but I know , more of this is just a drop of water to spill the glass . 
Harry bitterly said : 
Good ! 
That's great ! 
You told him you were ready to change his shoulder whenever he wanted to . 
Tell it to yourself that it is just that we try to see where we go where people keep staring at their forehead . 
Said Hermione decisively : 
I do not tell Ron anything . 
You tell it . That is the only way to make this possible . 
I do not want to run around with it to find a way to make it no longer childish ! 
Harry was so loud that the owls were parked on a nearby tree that panicked and flew . 
Maybe to come when you break his neck or it will not believe that he is not funny at all his reputation . 
Hermione quietly said : 
This is not a joke . 
Not a joke , Harry . 
She looked extremely worried : 
Harry , I'm thinking you know what we're going to do ? 
Right now , as soon as we get back to the castle ? 
Know , give Ron a game out 
Write to Sirius . 
You must tell him what happened . 
He told you to write to him about everything that happened at Hogwarts . He seemed to have anticipated what would happen . 
I've got parchment with goose feathers 
Harry looked around to see if anyone had heard their story , but the schoolyard was completely deserted . 
It says : 
Stop it . 
He had to return to the country just because the scar on his forehead ached . 
If I told him that someone had registered for me to participate in the Magic Trial Dare that he will go straight to the castle . 
Hermione sternly : 
Sirius wants you to tell him . Anyway , he ' ll know 
How can you know ? 
Hermione said very seriously : 
Harry , this can not be quiet . 
This competition is very famous , but you are also famous . 
You did not publish anything about your competition , so it was a surprise to you . The books about Who - Who - Know - Who are all out there . Half to say about you , you know and Sirius wants to hear everything from you , I know he wants to . 
Harry threw his last toast at the lake , saying : 
OK , okay . 
I will write to Sirius . 
Both of them watched the bread crumbs float on the lake for a moment before a huge tentacle bobbed out of the water , grabbing a piece of cake and dragging it down into the water . 
Then they returned to the castle . 
As he climbed up the steps , Harry asked , 
Who will use the owl to send a letter to Sirius ? 
He told me not to use Hedwig . 
Ask Ron if you can borrow 
Harry said bluntly : 
I did not ask Ron anything . 
Hermione said : 
Then borrow the school's support , anyone can use the school . 
Two children go to Camp owls . 
Harry gave Harry a piece of parchment , a squid and a goose , and walked around the long branches of the tree for a bean , watching all the different owls while Harry sat down . , leaning against the wall to write letters . 
Dear Sirius , 
I told you to write to me about the knick knacks at Hogwarts , so I told you about this . 
I do not know if you have heard of it , but the Magic Trilogy will take place in the suburbs this year and Saturday night I was selected as the fourth champion . 
I do not know who put my name in the Goblet , because you have not registered for the exam . 
Another champion of Hogwarts is Cerdic Diggory of the Hughes 
Harry stopped writing here , pondering . 
She eagerly wanted to reveal something about the sheer weight of fear that had weighed heavily on her chest last night , but she could not think of a way to convey that into words , so ultimately It just dipped its head in ink and wrote : 
Hope you are well , and also Buckbeak . HARRY 
He stood up , brushed the straw on his shirt , and said to Hermione , 
Done . 
Now Hedwig flapped his wings and landed on Harry's shoulders and held out one of his legs . 
Harry looked around to find the school owl , telling Hedwig : 
I can not give you this letter . 
I have to use the school 
Hedwig snapped a dazzling sound and flew away , so abruptly that his claws pressed Harry's shoulders . 
She turned her back to Harry and did not even look back once for the time Harry had bound the letter to the big square owl . 
When the school owl flew away , Harry came near to pacify the Hedwig , but he gazed at the beak of anger and rushed over onto a beam beyond Harry's reach . 
Harry is also angry : 
Come on Ron ! 
Is not that my fault ? 
If Harry thought the problems would be better than once people were accustomed to thinking he was a champion , then the next day he saw how wrong it was . 
Once back in class , it is impossible to avoid meeting other students in school . 
And it was clear that the students at the school , as well as the Gryffindor students , thought Harry had enrolled himself in the competition . 
However , unlike Gryffindor students , other students do not seem happy . 
The Hufflepuffs , who are often in harmony with the Gryffindor , now turn cold with the crowd . 
Just one session of herbal medicine is enough to express the attitude . 
Apparently the Hufflepuffs felt Harry had stolen the glory of their champion . 
The feeling is even more serious , perhaps , due to the fact that the Hufflepuffs have little glory , and Cerdic is one of the few students who can give the Hufflepuff students some glory . he is the one who once defeated Gryffindor in a Quidditch match . 
Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch - Fletchley , two of the Hufflepuffs , were normally friendly with Harry , but during the study they did not even say a word to Harry , even though they both reported together . They were on the same tray , and although they both laughed , it was a little uncomfortable at first , when a Niggaz jerked somehow out of Harry's hand , splashing in his face . 
Ron did not even talk to Harry . 
Hermione sat between them , trying to talk , but even though they all answered her normally , she tried to avoid seeing the other . 
Harry thought that even Professor Sprout seemed to be away from her , but she was the Hufflepuff Professor . 
Harry is also looking forward to meeting Hagrid in the usual circumstances , but sadly , to the Mysterious Life Care classroom , he meets Slytherin in school . 
It seems like this is the first time Harry has faced that crowd since he became champion . 
It was as if Malfoy came to Hagrid's hut with his familiar despicable canal . 
As soon as Malfoy arrived , his voice reached Harry's ear , and he told Crabbe and Goyle , 
Hey , look , we're here ! 
That guy ! 
Do you want the book signed ? Please sign me now , because I'm afraid it will not last long . Half of the triumvirate triumvirate , Potter , how long can you live ? 
I was about ten minutes after the competition started 
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled , flabbergasted , but Malfoy had to pause there , because Hagrid appeared from behind the old man's hut , trying to balance a pile of tall wooden casks like a towering tower . Scabbard , each tank contains a tailed Shrike . 
The horrible class heard from Hagrid explained that the reason for the killing of monsters was the overproduction of energy , so the problem was that every student would attach a wire Roll your neck to a monster and take it for a walk . 
All this program has only one point or only to make Malfoy completely dead . 
Malfoy glared at one of the wooden crates , repeating with disgust : 
Take this stroll for a walk ? 
Which exactly is the tie in place , the venom , the flaming tail , or the suction hose ? 
Hagrid explained : 
Tied around the middle . 
Ờ You will need to wear live leather gloves , just to stay away . 
Harry , come here to help us control this big one 
But Hagrid's real intent was to talk privately to Harry , not to the class . Waiting until everyone had tied up and led the monsters away , he returned to Harry in a very serious way : 
So are you , Harry ? 
Martial Arts Competition . 
Champion of the school . 
Harry corrected : 
Just one of the school's champions . 
Hagrid's dark black eyes under his thick eyebrows were worried : 
I do not know who signed up for you , Harry ? 
Harry tried hard to conceal his gratitude when he listened to Hagrid's words : 
So do not you believe that I did not do it ? 
Hagrid grumbled : 
Of course you are . 
I said you do not do , I believe you do not . 
And Dumbledore trusted her , that was enough . 
Harry bitterly said : 
May I know who did it ? 
Both of you look out on the grass ; The classrooms are now scattered , and every student is having a hard time with the monsters . 
Shrimp monsters are now nearly one meter long and extremely powerful . 
They are no longer colorless and unshielded , but have worn a thick , shiny , light gray armor . 
It looks like a jellyfish between giant scorpions and long crabs , but they have not seen their heads or eyes anywhere . 
Shrimp monster has become extremely healthy and tame them very hard . 
Hagrid said cheerfully , 
Looks like they are excited . 
Harry was about to say that Hagrid was talking about the monsters , because his classmates certainly did not seem to enjoy it . 
Sometimes , a scary explosion sounded , one of the tails of the monsters exploded , causing it to spurt several meters ahead , pulling at least one person down the stairs , struggling hard up . 
Suddenly Hagrid sighed , turning to look at Harry with nervous expression on his face . 
Well , I do not know , Harry . 
Every military incident seems to be aimed at you right Harry ? 
Harry did not answer . 
Oh , everything seems to happen because it's almost like what Hermione said when they walked around the lake , and that's why , according to Hermione , Ron did not even talk to him . 
The next few days were Harry's worst days at Hogwarts . 
It was almost the worst feeling it had experienced in the second year when most of the seniors in the school suspected it was the culprit who attacked the other students . 
But Ron was on his side at that time . 
He thinks that if he gets Ron backed up as a friend , he can deal with the hostility of the whole school , but if Ron does not like it he will not even try to talk to Ron . Anyway , it was lonely , in the midst of all the haters falling down from all sides . 
Harry could understand the attitude of the Hufflepuffs , though he did not like it at all , but they had their champion in support . 
It does not expect the Slytherins to less offend it less spitefully . For the Slytherins , Harry had been unhappy at all times , because Harry always helped the Gryffindor to defeat the Slytherin , both in Quidditch and Intercity . 
But Harry hoped that the Ravenclaw students could enthusiastically support it as a supporter of Cerdic . 
However , it is wrong . 
Most of the Ravenclaws seemed to think that it was too eager , and sought to gain a little more fame by stealing the name of the cup . 
It is true that Cerdic looks more like a champion than Harry . 
With a handsome look , straight nose , dark hair , gray eyes , it is hard to say between Cerdic and Viktor Krum who is more admired these days . 
It was true that Harry saw the sixth - year - old eagerly signing Viktor Krum's autograph around Cerdic at a luncheon asking him to sign his school bag . 
Again , in the absence of Sirius's cries , which Hedwig avoided approaching Harry , Professor Trelawney predicted with greater certainty than Harry's death , and in the professor's class . Flitwick , Harry practiced the Trigger so badly that he was given extra homework - He was the only one to receive extra work , not to mention Neville . 
Upon leaving the professor's classroom , Hermione assured Harry again : 
Actually not that hard Harry . 
During the lesson , Hermione had made the objects all over the room cry out to her , as if she were a mysterious magnet , a mop , a trash can , and a lunar lens . 
You do not focus on that 
Do not know why so hybrid 
Harry said in a mournful voice as Cerdic Diggory walked past it , crowded with laughter by a mob of daughters , and they looked at Harry as if it were a big tailed Shrewtail . 
But what about it , huh ? 
There are two more drugs now 
The poison is always a horror for Harry , but this time , the class of fear is no shortage of torture . 
Being locked in a basement for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherin students was Harry's greatest misery . 
All of the Slytherin students seemed determined to play Harry in the face of crime to become the school's champion . 
It had gotten past a good Friday , with Hermione sitting next to her and whispering the chorus : Shelf it , shelf it , shelf it , shelf it 
There is no better prospect today . 
When Harry and Hermione went to Snape's classroom in the basement after lunch , they noticed that the Slytherins were waiting outside the classroom , one of whom wore a large badge in front of his robes . 
At first Harry was taken aback , thinking they were wearing the H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T badge . 
" But then Harry noticed that all the badges had the same content : the words glowed brightly in the dim light of the basement corridor : 
CEDRIC DIGGORY SUPPORTER REALITY OF HOGWARTS 
Malfoy says loudly as he sees Harry : 
Do not these badges Potter ? 
Not only that - see it ! 
Malfoy pressed the insignia of his chest , the inscription on the badge immediately disappeared , and a new inscription appeared , the green POTTER OR 
Slytherin laughed . 
Each of them pressed their insignia , soon the words POTTER OR shine brightly around Harry . 
He felt his neck and face burning hot . 
Oh , so funny ! 
Hermione sarcastically said to Pansy Parkinson and the whole bunch of Slytherins laughing all over : 
Are you funny ? 
Ron was leaning against the wall with Dean and Seamus . 
She did not smile at all , but it did not hurt Harry either . 
Malfoy handed the badge to Hermione : 
Want a Hermione ? 
I have both . 
But do not touch my hand . 
I do not want a mud blood to wash his hands , do not understand ? 
Part of the throbbing anger over the past few days now breaks the barrier in Harry's chest , breaking . 
Harry pulled out his wand before he could think what it was doing . 
The people around Harry and Malfoy hurriedly dashed out of the hallway , and Hermione cried out in alarm : 
Harry ! 
Malfoy also withdrew his wand , said coldly , 
Then , go play , Potter . 
Now there is no Moody here to look at you . Do it , if you have liver 
In a flash , they look at each other , and then both actions , exactly at the same time . 
Harry screamed : 
Furnunculus ! ( meaning : Diem paint the fire ! ) 
Malfoy shouted . 
Densaugeo ! ( That is , the teeth grow long ! ) 
Sparks jutting out from the ends of the wand , alternating between silence and spurting out at sharp angles - Harry's spell hits the surface of Goyle , and Malfoy's spell hits Hermione . 
Goyle roared , raised his arms and covered his nose with an unhealthy boil that grew bigger and bigger . 
Hermione tightened her mouth , whimpering and moaning in panic . 
Ron hurried to see how she was doing : 
Hermione ! 
Harry turned to see Ron pulling Hermione's hand away from her face . 
The scene is not beautiful at all . 
Hermione's front teeth , which are larger than normal teeth , are now growing at a rate of horror ; made her more like a beaver with long grass teeth too lower lip , curved down the chin . 
She was aware of it , crying in horror . 
What's so noisy ? 
A deadly gentle voice resounded . 
Mr. Snape came . 
The Slytherins gathered to explain to their teacher . 
Snape pointed at a long yellow finger in Malfoy's face , saying : 
Explain the view ! 
Sir , Potter attacked me 
Harry shouted : 
We attack each other at once ! 
and he hit Goyle , he said 
Snape looked at Goyle . 
Its face now looks like a picture of a mushroom book . 
Snape said calmly : 
Goyle , go to the sick room . 
Shouted Ron : 
Malfoy hits Hermione , look ! 
He pushed Hermione in front of Snape's face so he could see her teeth . 
Hermione was trying hard to hide her face in her hands , but it was hard to hide the two long front teeth to her collar . 
Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin daughters bent over for the chuckle , hugging Hermione from behind Snape . 
Snape looked coldly at Hermione and said , 
I do not see anything else . 
Hermione uttered a cry of distress ; With tears running down her face , she turned away and ran away to the corridor . 
Both Harry and Ron screamed at Snape's face , probably at the same time . 
May their screams echoed so loudly in the corridor of stone , hear the ear of the brain , without knowing what words . 
In that chaotic sound , it was hard for him to hear the nicknames they called him . 
However , Snape knew the meaning . 
With a soft voice , Snape said , 
let's see . 
Except Gryffindor fifty . 
Banning Harry and Ron . 
Now go to class , otherwise there will be another week of ban . 
Harry's ear lurched . 
This injustice made it also want to curse Mr. Snape into a thousand pieces of mucus . 
He walked past Snape's face , walking with Ron back to the basement , throwing his briefcase down on the table . 
Ron was upset as well . 
For a moment Harry seemed to be in the middle of it and Ron was back to normal , but then Ron turned around , sitting down beside Dean and Seamus , leaving Harry alone . At the head of the tunnel , Malfoy turned his back to Snape , then pressed the insignia on his shirt , laughed arrogantly , the words POTTER or shoved again in the room . 
As the lesson began , Harry sat staring at Snape , imagining the horrible things that would happen to him as he knew how to execute the Torture . It would make Snape squat like a spider that's nuts , cracking and writhing 
Snape looked around the classroom , his cold black eyes flickering in disgust , and he shouted : 
Antidote ! 
All the games have to prepare the formula right now . 
I want to make the antidote carefully , and then we will choose someone to experiment with 
Harry's eyes met Harry , and Harry knew what was about to happen , and Snape would poison her . 
Harry imagined it was his cauldron that ran up the front of the class , and poured down Snape's shiny head . 
At that moment there was a knock on the door of the basement , and the door to the classroom opened . 
The opening was Colin Creevey . 
He stepped into the room , his beaming face gleaming with Harry , then went to the teacher's desk in front of the class . 
Snape asked curtly : 
What ? 
Sir , please allow me to take Harry up the stairs . 
Snape glared at his crooked nose , staring at Colin , making him smile on his eager face . 
Snape said coldly , 
Potter also learned a drug . 
When they finish school , they can go upstairs . 
Colin red rose : 
Teacher , Bagman wants to meet him . All the champions have to go , I see as they want to take pictures 
Harry is willing to trade anything he can for Colin's mouth for the boy to say the last few words . 
She casually glanced at Ron , but Ron steadfastly stared at the ceiling . 
Snape said , 
Well , all right , Potter , you put things in place , I want to come back here again for us to experiment with antidote . 
Colin shouted again : 
Teacher He must bring all the furniture of the photo , all the champion 
Snape said , 
OK ! 
Potter , clean up your belongings and go hide my eyes ! 
Harry threw his briefcase over his shoulder , got up , walked toward the door . 
As it passed through the Slytherin table , some POTTER OR TURNED in every direction around it . 
Just as Harry had just closed the door to the basement , Colin began to say , 
Is that magic , Harry ? 
No matter what , of course , is not it ? 
You're the champion , are you surprised ? 
They went up the stairs to the hall , Harry said , 
Suddenly , surprised . 
What do they want to shoot for , Colin ? 
I guess to post the Prophet . 
Harry's tone was dull : 
Oh well . is what i need 
Make people know more about themselves . 
When they came to the room , Colin said , 
Good luck to you ! 
Harry knocked on the door and went into the room . 
The room was a relatively small classroom , most of the tables and chairs had been moved to the back of the room , leaving a large space in the middle , but three tables were stacked in front of the panel . a long velvet cloth . Behind the velvet long table was a five - chair set , and Ludo Bagman sat on one of the five chairs . 
Mr. Bagman was talking to a witch Harry had never seen before . 
This witch is wearing a bright red dress . 
At the corner of the room , Viktor Krum was standing , his face glowing like always and not talk to anyone . 
Cerdic and Fleur were talking . 
Fleur looks much more cheerful than Harry did last time . 
She nodded her head back and let her long hair gleam in the light . 
An abdominal man holding a large black camera was glancing at Fleur through the corner of his eye , the camera in his hand gently fuming . 
Mr. Bagman suddenly saw Harry . 
He rushed to his feet and hurried forward . 
Ah , here it is , the fourth champ ! 
Here , Harry , there is nothing to worry about , just the Scales of Wax , the other judges will come in a little longer . 
Harry repeated anxiously : 
Scales wand ? 
Mr. Bagman said : 
We have to check the wrestlers of the full function , no matter what the terrible , you know , wand is the most important tool for the children to perform the upcoming exam . 
Now the experts are upstairs with Dumbledore . 
And then take some pictures . 
Mr. Bagman raised his hand to the witch in red , adding : 
this is Rita Skeeter . 
She is writing a small newspaper column for the Daily Prophet 
Rita looked at Harry , saying , 
Not really small , Mr. Ludo . 
Rita's bristly hair was curly and her curly curls were strangely stiff , and it was a bizarre contrast to her cheekbones . 
She wore eyeglasses , but her mop fingers clasped a crocodile leather briefcase . The fingertips are the three nails , painted red . 
Rita was still staring at Harry but told Bagman : 
I do not know if I was allowed to say a word to Harry Potter before we started ? 
You know , this is the youngest champion . Add a bit of color to that article 
Mr. Bagman exclaimed : 
of course ! 
Just do it if Harry does not object . 
Harry stammered : 
Err 
Rita Skeeter says : 
How cute ! 
Her reddish fingernails gripped Harry's arm with a fierce grip , and she pulled it out of the room , opening a door into another room . 
She said : 
Let's not stay in that noisy room . To see , well , this place looks intimate or ho this . 
it's a room to broom . 
Harry looked at the journalist . 
She said : 
This is so cute ! 
She settled herself insecurely on an upside - down couch , and pressed Harry to sit down on the paper box , then closed the door to the room , causing the two to sink in the darkness . 
Now to see 
She opened her crocodile leather briefcase , taking out a handful of candles . 
She waved a wand to light them up and let them float in the air in a mysterious way , allowing her and Harry to see what they were doing . 
Do not you mind , Harry , if you use a shorthand goose ? 
This way , I ' ll be free to talk to you normally 
Harry asked again . 
What is it ? 
Rita Skeeter's smile widens . 
Harry counted three golden teeth in her mouth . 
She came back with a hand from the crocodile leather handbag to a blue goose and a roll of parchment . 
She spread the parchment on Skower's multi - purpose junk . Harry and her . 
She held the goose feather head and sucked it with obvious excitement , then placed it straight on the parchment . 
The goose feather writing balances on the writing tip , slightly quivering . 
Try my name is Rita Skeeter , the Prophet . 
Harry looked down at the goose . 
Just as Rita had just said , the blue pen immediately began to take notes , writes running across the page : 
The gorgeous blonde Rita Skeeter , forty - three years old , wrote her strict stinging mournful names 
Really is cute ! 
Rita said again , but she tore the parchment into a lump , and tossed it into her bag . 
Now she leaned forward and said to Harry , 
So what made you decide to join the Magic Trilogy ? 
Err 
Harry hesitated again , and was distracted by the shorthaired gooseberry pencil . 
Although he did not say anything , the pen was running wild on the parchment , and when he was awake , Harry could read the words : 
An ugly scars , traces of legal disaster in the past , in addition to that is the charming face of Harry Potter with eyes 
Rita Skeeter decisively said : 
Do not look at the pen , Harry . 
Harry looked reluctantly at Rita's face . 
She repeated the question : 
Now tell me Why did you decide to join the Magic Trial ? 
Harry said : 
I do not know . 
I do not know why your name falls into the glass of fire . 
I did not give up my name . 
Rita Skeeter raised an eyebrow raised : 
Well , Harry , there's no need to be afraid of trouble . 
We all know that you should not play at all . 
But do not worry about that . Our readers will like a rebellious like you . 
Harry repeated : 
But I was not registered . 
I do not know who the person is 
Rita Skeeter asks : 
How do you feel about the upcoming task ? 
Nervous ? 
Concerned ? 
Harry's gnawing spirits upset when he replies : 
I have not thought to you I must be anxious . 
Rita quickly asked : 
In the past , champions often died , right ? So do you think about that ? 
Harry said : 
Yes people say this year's competition will be much safer 
The goose - feathered figure ran briskly through the parchment between them , running and running back and forth . 
Rita looked at Harry face to face , observing : 
Of course , I used to face death before , right ? How do you think it affects you ? 
Harry faltered again : 
Err 
Do you think your traumatic past trauma can help you earnestly prove yourself ? to be worthy of your name ? Do you think you might be tempted to enroll in the Magic Trilogy because ? 
Harry begins to mutter : 
I have not registered . 
Miss Rita said , ignoring Harry's reaction : 
Can you remember anything about my parents ? 
Harry said : 
Are not . 
What do you think your parents would think if they knew you were in the Magic Trial ? 
Proud ? 
Worry ? 
Angry ? 
Now Harry is really upset . 
How could she know how her parents felt if they were alive ? 
He could feel Rita Skeeter watching her closely . 
He frowned , avoiding Miss Rita's gaze , peering down at the inscriptions on the parchment : 
Tears from the blue eyes uttered as our story referred to the parents of Harry Potter , whom he did not remember at all . 
Harry says loudly : 
I have tears ! 
But before Rita added something , the door to the broom was opened . 
Harry looked , his eyes glimmered with glitter . 
Dumbledore was standing at the door , looking down at both of them squatting in the closet . 
Ms . Rita exclaimed , the joy revealed on her face : 
Dumbledore ! 
But Harry , noticing her shifty autopilot and parchment , suddenly disappeared from the Mystery Dispenser's junk box , and her clawed fingers hurriedly closed the bag of her handbag . her crocodile skin back . 
She stood up , holding out a large hand like a man's hand to shake Dumbledore's hand . 
How strong ? 
I hope he read my article in the summer about the International Witch Union Conference ? 
Dumbledore eyes flashing : 
unique place ! 
I especially like her description of me as a lost old man . 
Rita did not look confused at all . 
I do not want to make it clear that some of your ideas are outdated , Dumbledore , and that many of the wizards in the street 
Dumbledore bowed with a gentle smile and said , 
I am very happy to hear the explanations behind that loss , Rita , but I'm afraid we will have to discuss that later . 
The Wax Scale ceremony is about to begin , and if one of the four champions is hidden in the broom , the ceremony will not start . 
Harry is very happy to get rid of Miss Rita Skeeter . 
He hurried back to the room of the Wax Scale . 
The other contestants were sitting on chairs near the door . 
Harry quickly sat down next to Cerdic Diggory , looking up at the velvet long table , where four of the five judges were sitting , Professor Karkaroff , Maxime , Crouch and Ludo Bagman . 
Ms . Rita searched her seat in a corner of the room . 
Harry noticed that she had taken the parchment in her bag and spread it on the stool , then sucked on the automatic shovel , and then placed it on the parchment again . 
Dumbledore stood in his place at the judge's table , and told the champions : 
I would recommend Mr. Ollivander . 
He will examine the contestants ' wands to ensure that the wands are in good condition before the competition begins . 
Harry looked around , and he jerked his head in surprise as he saw an old wizard with big blue eyes standing quietly by the window . 
Harry had met Ollivander before . 
He was the creator of the wand , and Harry bought his wand at his shop three years ago at Crossroads . 
Mr. Ollivander stepped out into space in the middle of the room , saying : 
Miss Delacour , please show her chopsticks first . 
Fleur Delacour skimmed over to Ollivander and handed him the wand . 
He said : 
Hmm 
He twisted his wand between his fingers as he twirled a stick and his chopsticks emitted some pink and gold light . 
Then he brought it closer to his eyes , checking it very carefully . 
He said softly : 
Yes , nine and a half acres can not bend rosewood and contain a scrub 
Fleur said : 
A haircut of a fairy girl . 
One of my grandmother's hair . 
Fleur had blood in her blood . 
Harry thought and recorded this information to tell Ron but then he remembered that Ron was off playing with it . 
Mr. Ollivander said : 
Yes , I have never used fairies , of course . 
I find it makes the wand more temperamental , however , depending on the user , if it suits her 
Mr. Ollivander stroked his finger along the wand , obviously to check for scratches or roughness . 
Then he murmured : Orchideous ! ( Meaning : flowering ! ) And a bunch of flowers hatch right at the end of the chopsticks . 
Mr. Ollivander picked the bunch of flowers and handed Fleur the wand and bunch of flowers : 
Very cool , great , it works perfectly . 
Diggory , please come next . 
Fleur glided back to his seat , smiling at Cerdic as he passed by . 
Ollivander took the Cerdic wand with him more enthusiastically : 
Well , this is my own created wand , right ? Yes , I remember it very clearly . 
Containing a single hair of a beautifully beautiful male elephant must have up to seventeen hands ; It was almost horned when I tried to pluck its tail . 
Twelve - part one - quarter elastic comfort trousers . 
Is it in good condition ? 
Cerdic laughed : 
I just hit it last night . 
Harry looked down at his wand . 
He could see the fingerprints all over his wand . 
He slid a slit on his knee and began to scrub the scrubber in a sneaky manner . The tip of the wand spits out some golden light . 
Fleur Delacour gave Harry a look of supremacy , and he stopped , not wiping anymore . 
From the tip of Cerdic's wand , Mr. Ollivander launched a stream of silver smoke curled across the room to claim he was very pleased . 
Finished , he said : 
Please invite Krum . 
Viktor Krum got up , slipped over to Ollivander , his shoulders up , his nails propped up , he waved the wand out to Ollivander and stood still , his hands on his sack . 
Mr. Ollivander said : 
If I'm not mistaken , this is Gregorovitch's work . 
He is a talented wandmaker , though his style is not always the case 
He raised his wand and examined it for a minute , then backed up the wand in front . 
He told Krum : 
Rub the tree and the dragon heart , right ? 
Krum nodded . 
Slightly thicker than the ones commonly found in sticks . Ten quarters Avis ( meaning : flying birds ! ) 
The python's wooden wand explodes with a blast of explosives , a handful of winged birds fly out from the wandhead's head and fly through the window into the glowing light of water . 
Mr. Ollivander returned Krum the wand , saying : 
Good . 
Please invite the last one , Potter . 
Harry stood up , passing Krum to get to Ollivander . 
She handed him the wand . Ollivander's blue - green eyes suddenly glowed . 
He exclaimed : 
Yeah , that's right . Yes , yes , yes . 
I remember very well . 
Harry also remember very well . 
It can be remembered as if it had happened yesterday 
Four summers ago , on his eleventh birthday , Hagrid led him to Ollivander's shop to buy a wand . 
Ollivander measured Harry's assessment and then began to give it a handful of wands . 
Harry held and waved almost every wand in Ollivander's shop , until he finally saw that each wand was suitable for him . 
This wand , made from an elephant tree , eleven inches long , contains a single phoenix feather . 
Ollivander was surprised to see Harry fit well with this wand . 
He kept saying : 
It is strange , weird . 
Until Harry asks something weird , he explains that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand was extracted from a bird that had made the feather the wand of the Dark Lord Voldemort . 
Harry had never shared with anyone this information about his wand . 
He liked the wand very well , and as far as it was known , it was not possible for the relatives in his wand to wield Voldemort's wand to be like that . with Aunt Petunia . 
However , it is indeed hoped that Ollivander will not reveal to everyone in this room that . 
If he had said it , Harry had a funny feeling that Rita Skeeter's automatic shovel scoop would blow up the sensational news . 
Ollivander spent much time scrutinizing Harry's wand than all the other trees . 
Eventually , however , he made a tear spray from Harry's wand , then handed it over , claiming the wand was in perfect condition . 
Dumbledore stood at the judge's table , saying : 
Thank you all . 
Now you can go back to class - or maybe even faster if you go straight to the dining room , because the classrooms are nearing the end . 
Harry felt that finally something good had ended , he got up and left the room , but the man holding the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat . 
Mr. Bagman exclaimed excitedly : 
And shooting , Dumbledore , shooting ! 
Take all judges and contests , what about Miss Rita ? 
Rita Skeeter's eyes still clung to Harry , she said : 
Oh yes , let's do it first . 
And then maybe take some personal photos . 
Photo taking takes time . 
Maxime shone on everyone else wherever she stood , and the photographer could not stand far enough to put her whole body in full frame . 
Finally Maxime had to sit while everyone was standing around her . 
Mr. Karkaroff twisted his goatee around his finger to give it more curls . 
And Krum , whom Harry thought would have been accustomed to this kind of work , was drooling , half as elusive as standing behind the group . 
The photographer showed enthusiasm to take Fleur to the top , but Rita pulled Harry to the front , trying to push her in the spotlight . 
Then she insisted on taking photos of all the champions . 
Eventually everyone was released . 
Harry went down to the dinner hall . 
Hermione was not present in the dining room . 
Harry guessed that she is still in the sick room to adjust the teeth again . 
He ate alone at the end of the table , then returned to Gryffindor Tower , worried about the summoning exercises he had to do . 
Upon entering the bedroom , he meets Ron . 
When Harry walked into the room , Ron said in a squeaky voice : 
You have a shot . 
Ron pointed his hand at Harry's pillow . 
School owl is waiting for it . 
Harry exclaimed : 
Oh , that's great . 
Ron added : 
And tomorrow we are subject to a fine in Snape's vault . 
Then Ron went straight out of the room , not looking at Harry for one . 
For a moment Harry wants to run after Ron , it's unlikely he wants to talk to Ron or want to punch Ron one , both of which inspire him the same . 
But Sirius's reply was so enchanting 
strong . 
Harry strode across the room to the school owl , took the letter at his feet , opened it and read : 
Harry child , 
I can not tell you everything you want to say to me in a letter , because it's dangerous in case the owl is blocked . 
We need to talk face to face . 
Can you guarantee that you will be alone by the fireplace of the Gryffindor Tower at one o ' clock on the morning of November 22 ? 
He knows better than anyone else that he can take care of himself , and once Dumbledore and Moody are with him , he believes no one can harm him . 
However , there are some people who are trying to risk their lives . 
Enrolling in a contest is a very risky affair , especially doing it right in front of Dumbledore . 
Always alert , Harry . 
I still want something unusual . 
Let me know about the 22 nd as soon as possible . 
Sirius . 
CHAPTER 19 HUNGARY STYLE 
The prospect of meeting Sirius directly was all about helping Harry through the rough fortnight . That's the bright spot at the end of the tunnel never fading . 
The shock of knowing that he was the champion of the school is now partly quenched , and the fear that awaits the front begins to infiltrate it . 
The first exam is slowly approaching ; Harry felt as if the test was lurking in front of him like a terrible monster , blocking his way . 
Harry has never experienced nervous tension like this . 
It goes far beyond all the anxiety experienced by the past Quidditch matches , including the last match it faced against Slytherin to determine which team kept the Quidditch trophy . 
Harry found it difficult to think about calculating the future . 
It feels as though her whole life is coming to an end , and will end with the first test 
Admittedly , he did not know how Sirius would make it feel better about having to do an unknown , dangerous and dangerous magic before hundreds ; But with this one , just seeing a friendly face is precious . 
Harry replied to Sirius that it would be next to the fireplace of the common room at the hour Sirius suggested , and that he and Hermione had spent a great deal of time planning to get away with any of the outlaws . common room on the night of the appointment . 
If the worst happened , they would blow up a bomb , but they hoped they would not have to resort to that - Filch's supervisor would strip them alive rather than play . . 
And from then on , life was even worse for Harry on Hogwarts Castle , because Rita had published her article on the Triwizard Tournament , and that article turns out to be less of a competitive narrative than the nature of Harry's colorful story . 
Nearly the front page of the newspaper is covered by a picture of Harry ; while the article ( continued on page two , page six , and page seven ) is all about Harry . 
The names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions ( in spelling mistakes ) were crammed into the final line of the article , and Cerdic was never mentioned . 
That article appeared ten days ago , and Harry was still sick with a feeling of embarrassment as he thought of the article . 
Rita Skeeter attributed it to all the terrible things she could not remember ever saying in her life . 
Do not say in the bedroom to broom the day : 
I suppose you get the power from your parents . 
I know parents will be very proud if they can see me now Well sometimes at night I still cry for remembering them . 
You're so embarrassed to see that I know there's nothing that can hurt me in the game , because my parents will bless you 
But Rita went further than translating her stuttering into long lines ; She interviewed the people around her : 
Harry eventually finds love at Hogw arts . 
Harry's best friend , Colin Creevey , said that Harry rarely had a date with Hermi one Granger , a beautiful Muggle - born girl , and like Harry , was one of the best students in the school . 
From the moment the article appeared , Harry had suffered from people - mostly Slytherins - citing the article and jokingly commenting as it passed . 
Need a blind scarf ? In case of crying in Transfiguration . 
Since when did you become one of the best students in the school , Potter ? 
Or is this the school you and Longbottom set up together ? 
Harry ! 
Harry found himself upset and when he turned away in the corridor , he shouted : 
Oh yeah ! 
I was crying because I missed my lost mother , and now I'm crying a little more 
Do not you just do not drop your goose pen ? 
That's Cho . 
Harry felt his face red . 
She received the pen , stammered : 
Sorry for 
She said : 
I wish you a happy third day . 
I really hope you do well . 
That made Harry feel extremely stupid . 
Hermione also suffered equally in sharing this misery . 
But she did not scream innocently innocent people passing by ; In fact , Harry was so impressed with how Hermione coped with the situation . 
Pansy Parkinson shrieked when she met Hermione for the first time after Rita's article appeared : 
Beautiful ? 
That little girl ? 
Where are you compared to ? 
Compared with the mouse is ! 
Forget it . 
Said Hermione , his head high as he stepped over the Slytherin girls giggling , as if she had not heard the words of them . 
Shelves it , Harry . 
But Harry could not ignore it . 
Ron has not said a word to him since telling him about Snape's detention . 
Harry had hoped they could make it together for two hours . They were forced to mate Rat in Snape's vault , but that day was the day Rita's article was released . 
That article made Ron more convinced that Harry was a pleasure to play . 
Hermione goes crazy with both Ron and Harry . 
She kept talking to each other , trying to get them to talk to each other . 
But Harry was also very upset : he would only talk to Ron if Ron acknowledged that Harry had not dropped his name in Fire , and apologized for calling Harry a lie . 
Harry said stubbornly : 
This is not me ! 
At it ! 
Hermione said impatiently : 
You feel it ! 
And I know it's missing you too 
Is it missing ? 
No , my life needs it 
But it is a blatant lie . 
Harry likes Hermione but she can not replace Ron . 
Being friends with Hermione , there are not a lot of laughs at each other , but just a few more rounds in the library . 
Harry is not yet familiar with the Summoned Spell , apparently suffering from some sort of hindrance to this spell , and Hermione thinks that learning more about the theory can be good . 
As a result , they spend a lot of time in the lunch boxes . 
Viktor Krum spent a lot of time in the library , and Harry wondered what he was up to . 
Does he know that he is learning , or is he looking for something that will help him pass the test of the first test ? 
Hermione often complains about Krum in the library - it's not that he's bothering them - but because the girls often turn around and watch him behind the shelves , and Hermione is distracted . mind . 
She glared at Krum's sharp face and muttered angrily : 
What is he good looking for ! 
They liked him just because he was famous ! 
If he does not have that slut , they will not even look at him twice . 
Harry whistled through his teeth , correcting Hermione's words : 
Phantom Teeth . 
In addition to wanting to correct a word in Quidditch right , Harry also felt a pain when imagining Ron's face if he could hear Hermione talk about the finger . 
It's strange , but when I'm scared of something , and willing to trade anything to slow down , there's a habit of hurrying up . 
The days before the first test began to drift as if someone had corrected the clock , catching it running at twice the speed . 
Harry's feelings of uncontrolled panic clung to it no matter where it went , as nagging as the vicious comments on the Prophet's paper . 
On the seventh day before the first round , all students from the third year or more are allowed to visit Hogsmeade . 
Hermione tells Harry to get out of the castle for a while , and Harry does not need much admonition . 
It says : 
But what about Ron ? 
Do not you want to go with it ? 
Hermione slightly flushed a little : 
Ừ I think we can meet him at the Three Bows Shop 
Harry decisively : 
Are not ! 
Harry , this is stupid 
I will go , but I will not meet Ron , and I will wear my Invisibility Cloak . 
Hermione said , 
But I hate to talk to you in that jacket . 
I did not know whether I was watching you or not . 
So Harry wore the Invisibility Cloak in the bedroom , went down the stairs , and along with Hermione , the two of them went to Hogsmeade . 
Under the Invisibility Cloak , Harry felt extremely free . 
He looked at the students passing by as they entered the village of Hogsmeade , most of them wearing badges . Support Cerdic Diggory ! 
But there are no virulent comments to his ears , and no one cites the stupid article anymore . 
Moments later , as they walked out of the secretary of the Duchy , Hermione ate a large cream of chocolate , saying , 
People keep looking at themselves . 
They thought I was talking to myself . 
Then do not move your lips too much . 
Well , Harry , please take off your Invisibility Cloak for a moment , no one will bother us . 
Harry said : 
No ? 
Look behind you . 
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend walked out of the Three Wines Shop . 
The two of them walked beside Hermione without looking at the girl , as they walked and talked in a whisper . 
Harry must be close to the wall of the Duke to avoid being ripped by Rita crocodile leather handbags on his head . 
When they were gone , Harry said , 
She is staying in the village . 
I dare to bet is here to watch the first game . 
Speaking of these , Harry's stomach was filled with a wave of panic . 
It does not talk about this ; he and Hermione did not vow much on the first test ; It feels like Hermione does not like to think about it . 
Hermione looked through Harry , his gaze reaching the other end of the road : 
Go away . 
Why do not we go to the Three Broomsticks to drink a glass of beer . 
Do you feel cold ? 
Hermione added irritably , in order to accurately portray Harry's silence : 
You do not need to talk to Ron . 
The Three Hearts Trumpets are packed with students , mostly Hogwarts students , for a comfortable free lunch , but there are also a lot of magicians that Harry rarely see in places . any other . 
Harry deduces Hogsmeade is the only village in the world 
England , so it may be a paradise for those who are like ugly old witches - they are not good at disguising themselves with some wizards . 
It's hard to get through the crowd in an invisibility cloak ; In case you accidentally hit someone , this can cause dangerous questions to arise . 
Harry slid slowly toward an empty table in the corner , while Hermione went to buy a drink . 
As he crossed the pub , Harry saw Ron sitting with Fred , George , and Lee Jordan . 
Tremendously restrained Ron's desires , Harry finally managed to reach the empty table and sit down . 
A moment later Hermione came to sit with Harry and threaded through the Invisibility Cloak giving him a beer of beer . 
Hermione said , 
I look like a fool , sit here alone . 
Fortunately I have to bring something to do . 
And she pulled out a notebook , in which she recorded the records of H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
Harry saw his name and Ron was at the top of a very short list . 
It had been a long time since the meal they had been together , doing the prophetic work , and Hermione had raised her nose to appoint them as secretaries and treasurers . 
Hermione looked around the tavern , speaking with anxiety : 
You know , maybe I will try some of the people in Hogsmeade village to participate in H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
Harry took a sip of butter underneath the Invisibility Cloak and said , 
Oh yes . 
Hermione , as long as you give up the duck duck ? 
Cried Hermione , 
As long as the elves are entitled to and the right to work . 
You know , I started to think it was time to start acting . 
I'm wondering how the school kitchen is not available ? 
Harry said : 
Do not know . 
Ask Fred and George to try . 
Hermione sank into a fearsome silence while Harry drank his beer and gazed at the man in the bar . 
All of them seemed happy and relaxed . 
Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot are exchanging chocolate frog cards at a nearby table , both of whom wear the badge . Support Cerdic Diggory ! 
On the jacket . 
Right next to the door , Harry saw Cho and a large group of friends at Ravenclaw's house . 
However , she did not wear the Cerdic badge , which made Harry feel a little excited . 
What would it cost to be one of these people , sitting around , laughing and saying , no need to worry other than the exercises ? 
Harry imagined how it would feel to sit there if his name did not spit out of the Goblet of Fire . The surest thing is that it will not need to wear Invisibility Cloak . 
Ron will be sitting with it . 
The three of them will probably be happy to imagine the deadly deadly exams that the schools champions face on Tuesday . 
He will be really eagerly awaiting that day , watching anything that the champions will do will be with everyone safely sitting in the chair cheering cheer Cerdic 
Harry wonders what other champions are feeling right now . 
Every time Harry saw Cerdic was as if he was surrounded by a crowd of admirers , he looked a little nervous but excited . 
Occasionally Harry looked at Fleur Delacour in the corridor . 
She looked exactly the same as before , arrogant and calm . 
Krum is sitting in the library with his nose in the book . 
Harry thought of Sirius , and the tightening gash in his chest seemed to be unbuttoned , becoming somewhat soft . 
In twelve hours it will be spoken to Sirius , because tonight was the night Sirius had promised to meet him at the Gryffindor common room - as long as he did not do anything . Something happened that happened recently 
Harry said , 
Look ! 
Uncle Hagrid ! 
Hagrid's hunchbacked head popped up in the crowd . ( He had mournfully left his buns ) Harry wondered why he did not see him instantly , when Hagrid was so big . 
But when he stood carefully he saw Hagrid leaning down to talk to Professor Moody . 
In front of old Hagrid is still a large glass of water , and Professor Moody is pulling his bottle of wine out to drink . 
The beautiful owner of the restaurant , Rosemerta , did not seem to like it . 
She looked at the professor with half suspicious eyes as she cleared the cup around him . 
Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her steamy honey . 
But Harry knew better why Moody had done so . 
Professor Moody had told them during the Dark Arts Defense session that he always liked to cook for his own food and drink , because if the Dark Wizards wanted to poison one The cup that I do not care about is too easy . 
When Harry saw them , it was then that Hagrid and Professor Moody got up to leave . 
Harry waved , but remembered that Hagrid could not see it . 
However , Professor Moody stopped walking , his magical eye looking directly at the corner where Harry was standing . 
He clapped his hands on Hagrid's back ( he did not reach his shoulder ) , whispered something in his ear , and then they both went across the pub , toward Hermione and Harry's desk . 
Hagrid said loudly : 
Well , Hermione ? 
Hermione smiled back . 
Hagrid , hello . 
Professor Moody lobbed around the table and bent down ; Harry thought he had read the handbook on H . V . Đ . C . Q . L . G . T . 
, until he whispered : 
That nice jacket , Potter ! 
Harry's eyes widened at him . 
The loss of Moody's nose was especially noticeable when viewed within a few inches . 
Professor Moody laughed . 
Your eyes can say I mean , you can 
The professor said quietly : 
Oh , he could see through the Invisibility Cloak . 
And you can tell me that sometimes it's useful . 
Hagrid smiled at Harry . 
He knew Hagrid could not see it , but it was obvious that Professor Moody had told Hagrid that Harry was sitting there . Now , Hagrid bent down to read H . Handbook . 
and in such a whispering voice that only Harry could hear : 
Harry , come to see my uncle at midnight in his cabin , wearing the Invisibility Cloak . 
Then straightened up , Hagrid said loudly , 
Nice to meet you , Hermione . 
He winked and walked away . 
Professor Moody follows the old man . 
Harry was surprised , saying : 
Why would Hagrid want to meet me at midnight ? 
Hermione was amazed : 
Really ? 
I wonder what he wants ? 
Harry , I do not know whether you should go or not ? 
She looked anxiously and shrieked a little : 
That could make him late for Sirius . 
It was true that going down to Hagrid's hut at midnight meant the meeting with Sirius was just too close . 
Hermione asks Harry to send Hedwig to Hagrid , telling him he can not walk - Hermione always thinks that the owl will agree to deliver the mail , of course . 
But Harry thought what he wanted Hagrid to do , then he should follow suit . 
It was very curious to know what Hagrid wanted to see in the middle of the night . 
Hagrid never called him to see him at night . 
At eleven o ' clock that night , Harry pretended to go to bed early , then covered his Invisibility Cloak over himself , crawled back downstairs and walked across the common room . 
There are very few people in the room . 
Only the Creevey brothers are struggling to find a way to license a pile of badges . Support Cerdic Diggory ! they have collected , turning them into supporters of Harry Potter ! 
But until then , their efforts struggled to reach the sticky badges in the words POTTER OR . 
Harry sneaked past them , to the side of the portrait hole and stood waiting for a minute or so , eyes always watching the clock . 
Then , as previously conceived , Hermione opened the portraiture of Mrs. Beo from outside for Harry to come out . 
He squated across the girl , whispered thanks , and walked out of the castle . 
School grounds are very dark . 
Harry went down the lawn to the light that came from Hagrid's cottage . 
Inside the carriage giant Beauxbatons are also lit ; Harry could hear Mrs. Maxime talking inside the carriage as she knocked on Hagrid's hut . 
Hagrid looked around and whispered : 
That kid , Harry ? 
Harry spat in the hut and pulled the Invisibility Cloak . 
Yes . 
What's wrong ? 
Said Hagrid . 
Have this for you . 
Hagrid seemed excited . 
He was wearing a cotton ball over an open button like an overstuffed artichoke . 
Seems like he has not used the oil on the axle yet , but he certainly managed to brush his shaggy hair - he could find the missing comb on his hair . 
Harry asked wistfully : 
What do you plan to see ? 
He wondered whether the spawn had spawned , or that old Hagrid had just bought another three - headed dog from a bar . 
Said Hagrid . 
walk with you , keep quiet , and stealth in your coat . 
We do not need to bring Fang , it will not be fun 
Uncle Hagrid , I can not stay long , you must go back to the castle at an hour 
The old Hagrid did not listen ; He opened the door of the hut and strode quickly into the darkness . 
Harry hurried to find Hagrid looking at the Beauxbatons carriage . 
Hagrid , what ? 
Shit ! 
Hagrid said softly and knocked three times on the door with his two gold wands crossed . 
Mrs. Maxime opens the door . 
She put a silk scarf around her massive shoulders . 
Seeing Hagrid , and Maxime smiling . 
Ah Agrid is it time ? 
Hagrid smiled to Maxime : 
Cotton ! 
He put out an arm to help Mrs. Maxime step down to the golden steps . 
After Mrs. Maxime closed the door behind her , Hagrid gave one arm to the railing , and they both walked around the edge of her grazing of her giant winged horses . Behind them , Harry snapped away , completely bewildered . 
Would Hagrid want to show Harry Maxime ? 
Whenever he wants , he can not see Maxime ? 
How could she be so hard to see ? 
But Maxime seems to be as bewildered as Harry , because when she goes around playing for a moment , she asks : 
Where are you taking me , Agrid ? 
Said Hagrid , slightly rude : 
You will enjoy this . Take that seriously , believe me . 
Just do not tell anyone I just show her , right ? 
Looks like she does not know anything about this . 
Maxime blinked long black eyelashes : 
Of course not . 
And they continue to walk again . 
Harry became increasingly bewildered as he ran to the feet of the two giants , for a moment he saw the clock . 
This Hagrid daredevil plans to jump unexpectedly , which may cause him to miss an appointment with Sirius . 
If the two adults did not arrive soon enough , then they would go back to the castle , leaving Hagrid to enjoy the moonwalk with Maxime . 
But then when they were walking as far as the forest belt , so distant that the lake and the castle were all gone , Harry suddenly heard something . 
People are screaming in front of them , and then a roar of noise grows 
Hagrid led Mrs. Maxime around a grove and then stood . 
Harry rushed to their side . 
For a split second , Harry thought he saw the campfire , and people rushed around and then his mouth fell open . 
Dragon . 
Inside a caged barn with thick planks , four grown - up , terrifying and ugly - looking dragons , standing on their hind legs , roared and sprayed fire . 
From the mouth filled with fanged teeth on the neck up to the height of seventeen meters , the fire burst into the dark night sky . 
There was a silver - colored , horned and long horn , groaning and snarling at the mages on the ground . 
A green , smooth scab , trying to stammer and struggling ; a red one around the jagged jagged face , jutting into the air with mushroom shaped clouds ; and the last one was a great black one , looking more reptilian than the others , standing near Harry . 
At least three dozen wizards are mating the dragons , seven of them nesting around one , trying to pull the chains together with leather belts around the neck and around the dragons . 
As if mesmerized , Harry looked up , above his head , and he saw the black dragon's eyes , with his eyes fixed upright like cat's eyes , protruding , for fear or anger , Harry could not be sure . The dragon emits a horror sound , a chanting sound , a scream 
A magician standing near the fence shouting : 
Get out of there , Uncle Hagrid ! 
The magician was holding onto the chain he was holding : 
You know , they can spray a fire of up to seven meters in length , and I've never seen a thorn tail spout fire less than thirteen meters . 
Hagrid asked quietly , 
Is not it beautiful ? 
Another screaming scream : 
Not good at all ! 
The Stun Quiz begins , counts to the third ! 
Harry saw each of the dragons pull out a wand . 
They shouted : 
Stupefy ! ( meaning : Unexplainable ! ) 
The shimmering daggers in the darkness look like rockets , bursting into raindrops and falling into the scaly skin of the dragons . 
Harry observed the nearest dragon standing dangerously on his hind legs ; its jaw is wide open while the trumpet has been silenced , its nostril abruptly turning off the flame , its only smoke , and slowly down , the dragon falls down . 
The heavy , dark - skinned dragon touched the ground with such a heavy weight that Harry could see that it made the trees behind him tremble . 
The dragon keepers lowered their wand and headed for the dragons who rolled to the ground , each with a small hill . 
They hurriedly tied the chains and then tightened them securely to the iron piles they had lashed deep into the ground with their wands . 
Hagrid exclaimed to Maxime : 
Want to see closer ? 
They went to the fence , and Harry followed . 
The magus had warned Hagrid not to come close now , and Harry realized who that was : Charlie Weasley . 
He walked to Hagrid's face to talk , his breath panting : 
Well , Hagrid ? 
These dragons are all right and we put them in Sleep State on the way here , thinking that when they woke up in the darkness they would be nicer , who cares , as you see , they are not . Have fun , do not know what kind of fun 
Hagrid carefully observed a dragon , a black child , with something almost fond of : 
Where do you find these dragons , Charlie ? 
The eyes of the black dragon are still open . 
Harry could see his glossy black eyelids glossy yellow . 
Charlie said : 
This is a dragon tail - Hungarian Gai . There was a Welsh green , the smaller one was the Swedes , the gray one , the red one . 
Charlie looked around ; Maxime was walking around the fence of the dragon cage , staring at the stunned dragons . 
Charlie said sternly : 
I'm not afraid to follow her , Hagrid . 
Champions are not allowed to know what is going to happen . 
She can also tell her disciples ! 
Hagrid shrugged , still gazing at the dragons : 
Uncle only think is a pleasure to see . 
Charlie shook his head : 
A romantic date that Hagrid . 
Said Hagrid . 
Four are each champion a dragon , right ? 
What would they do to the dragon ? Fighting with the dragon ? 
Charlie said : 
I think it's only through the dragons . 
We will intervene if the dragons become too much . 
Great Despair is always available . 
The dragons of the mothers cherish them , I do not know why but I tell you this , I do not dare anyone with the tail dragon - Hungary where . 
An ugly wild animal . 
Apparently , its tail is as dangerous as its front . 
Charlie pointed his hand at the tail of the tail dragon - Hungarian Gauntlets , Harry saw on each of the tail of the tail that spit on long copper spikes . 
At this time , there were five of Charlie's co - workers hanging around the tail dragon - Hungary Gai , they just staggered up , hands holding the sheets carefully carefully put the eggs down next to the dragon tail - Hungarian Gai . 
Hagrid spat out a desperate moan . 
Charlie said : 
You've counted them , Hagrid . 
Charlie asked , 
How is it 
Said Hagrid . 
Healthy re . 
He still looked at the dragon eggs . 
Just hope it stays healthy after confronting these dragons . 
Charlie's tone is clear , his eyes also look at dragons : 
I do not dare tell the cheek or the first test it will do is test what , she has not worried about it . 
Mr. Charlie mimicked Mrs. Weasley's anxiety : 
How could they let it attend the competition , it was so small . 
Mom thought it was safe in school , she thought there must be an age limit ! 
After a meal in which the Daily News published an article about Harry , she kept saying , ' She still loves her parents ! 
Oh , how miserable it is , you know what ! 
Harry felt enough . 
Believing in the fact that Hagrid would not even remember it , once there were four dragons and a Maxime to get his attention , Harry quietly turned his heels and started back towards the court . Castle . 
He did not know if he was happy to see what was going to happen on the first test . 
Maybe this is better . 
The initial shock was over . 
Maybe it would be the first time he had seen the dragon for the first time , it could have fallen in front of the whole school , but he would not have been able to play it anyway , but it would only be armed with his wand . It's only the wand that now feels like a stick . 
With that wand it must fight against a fire - breathing dragon , its back full of thorns , scaly skin , 17 feet high . 
And it must pass the dragon . 
In the eyes of everyone . 
How do you 
Harry walked up and down the side of the forest ; It was only fifteen minutes to return to the fireplace in the common room to talk to Sirius , and he remembered that he had never wanted to talk to anyone else with Sirius . is hurrying , suddenly it stumbles over something hard . 
Harry fell backward , his eyes narrowed ; Grasping the Invisibility Cloak around him , he heard the sound of a man moaning beside him : 
Ouch ! 
Who's that ? 
Harry hurriedly checked that the Invisibility Cloak covered it , then lay still , staring at the shadow of the magus who had touched it . 
Harry realized the goatee was Karkaroff . 
Mr. Karkaroff looked around , suspiciously , asking again : 
Who's that ? 
Harry remained silent and quiet . 
After a minute or so , Mr. Karkaroff seems to have mistaken him for a beast . 
He looked around as if hoping to find a dog . 
Then he walked quickly under the forest canopy toward the dragons . 
Harry stood up slowly and carefully , then went on fast , so as not to make a lot of noise , through the dark night , back to Hogwarts Castle . 
He knew what Karkaroff was looking for . 
You have sneaked out of your ship to find out what the first test that the champions will have to do ? 
He might have seen Hagrid and Maxime walking around in the woods - the two of them taking a distant look from the distance is not difficult to see . 
And now , Mr. Karkaroff , there is only one thing to do with the noise , and he , like Maxime , will know what is going on for the champions . 
Thus , the only champion who knows nothing about what awaits him on the third day is Cerdic . 
Harry reached the castle , slammed through the front door , and began to climb the marble stairs ; He almost breathed his breath , but he did not dare slow down . It was less than five minutes by the fire . 
He gasped to Mrs. Beo snoring in the picture frame hanging in front of the portrait hole : 
Three three ! 
She muttered sleepily , her eyes unfocused : 
If you say so , the picture comes first to let Harry go through the hole . 
It came to the living room that the room was completely deserted , and based on the normal atmosphere there was no odor , Harry guessed that Hermione did not need to bomb the stool so that it and Sirius were game . private matters . 
Harry reached for the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair near the fireplace . 
The room is still dark , the fire in the fireplace is the only light source . 
Near the place where it sat , on the table , some badges Support Cerdic Diggory ! the Creevey brothers tried to swap content that reflected flickering light . 
The words on that badge now turned into HARRY LUCK . 
Harry turned to look at the flames and jumped up . 
Sirius's head was on fire . 
If Harry had never seen Diggory do exactly as it is in the Weasley family's kitchen , it would have scared the man out . 
Fortunately , it is not afraid anymore , it's a smile , it's a long time before it reappears on its face . 
He jumped out of the couch , went to the couch and said , 
Sirius , how are you ? 
Sirius is now different from the one in Harry's memory . 
When the two broke up before , the hollowed - out Sirius's face was wrinkled , all over his face with long , bearded hair . 
But now the hair has been cut short , shaved , Sirius's face looks fuller , and he looks younger , resembling a man in a photo taken on the wedding day of Harry's cheeks . 
Sirius said sternly : 
Do not worry about me . 
How are you ? 
For a moment . 
Harry said : 
Baby is fine . 
But it can not say so . 
It poured out the colon , saying more than anything it said over the past few days , without restraining itself . 
She told Sirius about how no one believed that it was not her intention to enroll in the competition , about how Rita Skeeter had fabricated it in a paper published in the Prophet's Daily . It was ridiculed when he walked down the corridor , and Ron , Ron did not trust him , Ron jealous of him . 
And then Hagrid showed me what would happen to me on the first exam , Sirius , it was a dragon , and I was just a wimp . 
Harry stopped talking in despair . 
Sirius looked at Harry , eyes full of kindness , his eyes still not lost the obsessive wildness that Azkaban created . 
Sirius was silent for Harry to empty his heart , not once interrupted it , then he said : 
Dragon , there's a solution , Harry , but we ' ll talk about it later . - You can not stay here long . You have to break into a witch's house to use the fireplace , but they can . return at any time . 
There are things you want to be aware of . 
what is it ? 
Harry felt his spirals drop in a V shape , surely it would not be worse than the dragon he was about to confront ? 
Sirius said : 
Karkaroff . 
Harry , he's a Death Eater . 
Do you know Death Eaters ? 
What is it ? 
He was arrested , imprisoned in Azkaban prison with his uncle , but then he was released . 
He daresay that it was Dumbledore's reason to demand a Divine Light at Hogwarts this school year - to oversee Karkaroff . 
Moody was the one who arrested Karkaroff , sent him to Azkaban for the first time . 
Harry slowly said : 
Is Karkaroff released ? 
His brain seemed to be struggling to absorb another piece of information . 
Why did they release him ? 
Sirius said bitterly : 
He compromised with the Ministry of Magic . 
He said he had seen his mistake , and he gave his names to the masses of people who had been imprisoned by Azkaban in his place . He could tell you that in Azkaban he was not very popular . . 
And since he left prison , as far as he knew , he taught Dark Arts to every student who had attended his school . 
I also have to be aware of the Durmstrang school . 
Harry said , 
Yes , yes . 
But do you mean that Mr. Karkaroff dropped his name in Gummer ? 
Because if he had done that , he would have been a good actress . 
He seems very angry about that . 
He also wants to not let him play anymore . 
Sirius said : 
We all knew he was a good playwright , because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to release him , right ? 
Now , he is eyeing the Prophecy . 
Harry 
Harry bitterly said : 
You and the world and you read between the lines of the article Rita wrote last month , Mr. Moody was attacked the night before his arrival at Hogwarts . 
Oh , I know she said there was a false alarm . 
Harry said openly , but Sirius hurried over to say , 
But to some extent I do not think so . 
He thought someone had tried to stop him from going to Hogwarts . 
He thought someone would know that his job would be much more difficult if there were Mr. Moody around . 
And no one investigated that , because the crazy Eye - Intrusion was so commonplace . 
But that does not mean he does not see a real thing . 
Mr. Moody is the best omens of all time in the Ministry of Magic . 
So what are you saying ? 
Are Karkaroff trying to kill her ? 
But why ? 
Sirius hesitated . 
Then he slowly said : 
Recently I heard something very strange . 
These days , the Death Eaters seem to be working harder . 
They flaunt them in the World Quidditch Cup , right ? 
There are callers on the Black Sign and have you heard of a missing Wizard of the Ministry ? 
Harry asked again . 
Is Bertha Jorkins ? 
that's right 
She disappeared in Albania , and it is here that rumors have surfaced that Voldemort is hiding . She must have known about the Magic Trilogy going to take place at Hogwarts , right ? 
Yes , but does not it seem she goes straight to Voldemort ? 
Sirius said gently : 
Listen , Harry , you know Mrs. Bertha Jorkins . 
She also attended Hogwarts School when she studied here , she studied with three children in several classes . 
And she is a fool . 
Very curious but not mindful , 
no mind at all . That's not a good combination , Harry . 
He daresay that she is easily lured into a trap . 
Harry asked : 
So is Voldemort possibly getting information on the Magic Trilogy ? 
Do you want to say that ? Do you think Karkaroff is probably here to execute his orders ? 
Sirius said slowly : 
I do not know . 
As a result , I do not know if you think Karkaroff is the kind of person who comes back to Voldemort unless he knows Voldemort has enough power to protect him . 
But regardless of who dropped his name in the Fire , that person would have been intentional , and he could not help but think that the competition would be a good opportunity to attack me and still act as if it was just that . an accident . 
Harry grinned gloomily : 
The conspiracy seems to be perfect , considering their current status , they will just stand back and let the dragons do what they want . 
Then Sirius said very quickly : 
Yes , the dragons . 
Is there a way to solve Harry ? Do not try to use Spell Blaster - The dragon is so powerful magic that no single spell casters can knock them down . 
It would take about half a dozen magical mages at one time to rule a dragon . 
Harry said : 
Yes , I know , I see . 
Sirius continues : 
But you can handle the dragon alone . 
There is a way , and I just need a simple mantra . 
Just 
But Harry held up a hand to signal Sirius not to say . 
Her heart suddenly beats like it's about to explode . 
He heard footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him . 
He whispered to Sirius : 
Go away ! scat ! 
Someone is coming ! 
Harry upturned , covering the fireplace - If anyone saw Sirius's face on Hogwarts campus It was sure to get up a riotous earthquake - the Ministry would be dragged - and it , Harry , will be interrogated where Sirius is 
Harry heard a small noise in the fireplace behind him and knew Sirius was gone . 
He stared at the twisted staircase to see who was inspired to walk at an hour , making Sirius unable to tell him how to get past a dragon . 
It's Ron . 
Dressed in a pale , brown pajamas , Ron down the stairs , standing opposite Harry across the room , looked around , asking : 
Who are you talking to ? 
Harry pours : 
Do you have time to play ? 
What time do you go down here ? 
Ron shrugged . 
I just wonder where the game is 
But Ron suddenly rose up : 
And nothing . 
I'm going to bed . 
Did you think of it to hear it ? 
Harry screamed at Ron . 
Harry knew that Ron did not know anything about it accidentally , Ron knew that Ron did not mean to do it , but Harry was disagreeable . At this point Harry hated everything about Ron , hated his ankle . Reveal some stools underneath the pantyhose . 
Ron's face was red with anger . 
It says : 
Sorry to hear . 
I should know that you do not want to be disturbed . 
I will let the next interview continue in peace . 
Harry grabbed one of the POTTER LABELS on the table , using his mighty throws through the room . 
The badge hit Ron's forehead and echoed . 
Harry said : 
For that . 
You will wear that on next Tuesday . 
If you're lucky , now you can have a scar on your forehead . You want that too , right ? 
Harry strode across the room toward the twisted staircase ; In his heart he wanted Ron to stop him . 
He wanted Ron to throw in his face a fist , but Ron just stood there , in his pajamas too small , and Harry , after rattling up the stairs , lay awake on the bed for boiling anger . A long time later , Ron still does not hear Ron return to his bed . 
Chapter 20 FIRST TEST 
Harry wakes up on Saturday morning , dresses absentmindedly until he finds himself wearing a hat in his footsteps before realizing it is not a stocking . 
In the end , he also wore clothes , then hurried to find Hermione , meet her sitting at Gryffindor's long table in the main hall , eating breakfast with Ginny . 
Harry's anxiety overwhelmed him , he did not eat , waiting for Hermione to eat the last spoon porridge of her , then pulled Hermione to the school grounds . There , Harry told Hermione about the dragons , about everything Sirius had told him . 
This story made them take a stroll around the lake . 
Despite the panic of Sirius ' warning about Karkaroff , Hermione still thinks that the dragons are a more pressing matter . 
She risked her life saying : 
We just have to try to keep you alive until Tuesday night , then come and take care of Mr. Karkaroff . 
They went around the lake three times , trying to think of a simple mantra that could conquer a dragon . 
But at the end of the walk , they did not give them anything , so they went to the library to relax and study in it . 
They pulled down all the books they could find on dragons and both rolled up their sleeves and started looking at a pile of books . 
Pruning the claw by treating the scabs This is so worthless , this is for the old men like Hagrid to care for them healthy . 
Dragons are extremely difficult to eliminate , which is due to an ancient spell that has permeated their thick skin , leaving no spell to penetrate except for the strongest spells . But Sirius says it is only A simple mantra is okay 
Harry threw aside the Overbearing One , saying : 
Then we try to find in simple mantra books . 
She returned to the table with a pile of mantras , put them down on the table , and the two began to take turns swiping each other . 
Hermione sat next to the endless murmur : 
Well , there are Charms that convert but what do you eat ? 
Unless you convert your fangs into alcohols or something that makes it less dangerous . The trouble is , as the book says , there is not much to pass through the skin of the dragon . But a big thing like a dragon is really hard to have hope for , and I'm not sure even Professor McGonagall can do it unless you set yourself up for charity ? 
Maybe it will give you some strength ? 
But they are not simple charms , that is , we have not done it in the classroom , we only know about them by doing our regular Magic Exercises . 
Harry whistled through his teeth : 
Hermione , can you please stop for a second ? 
I'm trying to concentrate . 
But when Hermione was silent , Harry's mind was filled with nothing but the empty hollow , no place for concentration . 
It desperately looks down at the contents of the Charm for the busy and the living . 
Shave your head immediately . 
But the dragon does not have chili hair ... this only increases the fire power of the dragon blade is what the dragon needs , to get more weapons 
Oh , no , he's back , why does not he read right on his fucking train ? 
Hermione exclaimed when Viktor Krum strolled in , glanced at an unfamiliar look through them , then sat down at a remote corner with a pile of books . 
Come on , Harry . 
We go back to the common room just a little longer is the club of his admirers will come here , 
And no wrong , when they both left the library , a toddler girl's load passed over their faces , and a child also wore a scarf around her waist . 
Harry could not sleep that night . 
When it woke up on Monday morning , it seriously considered , for the first time , the possibility of fleeing from Hogwarts . 
But when he looked around the hall at breakfast time , and thinking about leaving Hogwarts Castle for what it meant , he knew it could not do that . This is the only place where it was happy Ừ , it is said that he was happy to live with his parents , but that memory can not remember anything . 
Somehow , realizing that staying at Hogwarts School to face the dragon would be better than returning to the house on Privet Drive . Living with Dursley worked well with Harry - which made him feel good . slightly calm down a bit . 
It was hard to eat all of salt ( her throat was not working so well ) . When she and Hermione got up , they saw Cerdic Diggory also leaving the Hufflepuff table . 
Cerdic still does not know anything about the dragon . He is the only champ who does not know anything about it , if it is as Harry speculates that Maxime and Karkaroff have both informed Fleur and Krum . 
Harry looked at Cerdic leaving the hall and decided . 
She said to Hermione : 
I will meet you at the cage listening to Hermione . 
Go ahead , you ' ll catch up with me again . 
Harry , you will be late for school , the bell is about to ring and I will catch up to you , okay ? 
As Harry ran to the bottom of the marble staircase , Cerdic reached the top . 
He was surrounded by a sixth - grader girl . 
Harry did not want to talk to Cerdic in front of the girls ; It was among those who quoted Rita's article to ridicule it when it went near them . 
Harry follows Cerdic at a distance and sees him walk to the classroom of the spell . 
Harry suddenly came up with an idea . Standing a distance away from the crowd , Harry withdrew his wand , carefully : 
Diffindo ! ( meaning Tear ) 
Cerdic's pair broke open . 
Leather , writing goose feather books falling on the floor splashed across the floor , several squid ink crushed . 
Cerdic bent down to help him pick up again , but Cerdic said in a frenzy : 
do not bother Go and tell Professor Flitwick I'm going to class right now 
This is exactly what Harry hoped for . 
He waved his wand in his robes , waiting for Cerdic's classmates to make it through the classroom , he rushed to the corridor now completely deserted , only to himself and Cerdic . 
Cerdic had just picked up a copy of the Advanced Transfiguration Guide , which had been smudged with ink , and said to Harry , 
Hello ! 
My bag was brand new and all 
Harry said : 
Cerdic , the first test is the dragon . 
Cerdic looked up : 
What ? 
Harry said quickly , in case Professor Flitwick came out to see Cerdic's situation . 
Dragon . 
They have four dragons , one for each champion , and we have to overcome them . 
Cerdic glared at Harry . 
Harry saw the horror that he had felt on Saturday night , burning in Cerdic's gray eyes . 
Cerdic asked in a dull voice : 
Are you sure ? 
Harry said : 
It seems like a nail in the column . 
I see them . 
But how do you know ? 
We are not allowed to know 
Harry knew that Hagrid would be in big trouble if he told the truth , so he just said quick : 
Do not bother with that ! 
But I'm not the only one . 
Fleur and Krum now know - both Maxime and Karkaroff have seen the dragon . 
Cerdic straightened up , his hands covered with goose feathers , parchment , and books , his tattered suit strapped to his shoulders . 
He glanced up at Harry , and in his eyes was a confused look , almost acrimonious . 
He asked : 
Why do you tell me ? 
Harry looked at Cerdic with disbelief . 
It must be that Cerdic would not have asked that question if his eyes had seen the dragons . 
Harry will not let his opponent , even his worst enemy , confront the monsters without being prepared . 
Well , whether it was Malfoy or Snape 
She told Cerdic : 
Just to be fair . 
Now we all know we all have the same position , right ? 
Cerdic was still looking at Harry with a slight suspicion , when Harry heard a familiar crackling sound behind his back . 
He turned around and saw Moody - eyed Mister - crazy from the classroom going out . 
He elected the floor : 
Follow me , Potter . 
And Diggory , about class ! 
Harry looked up at Moody . 
Do not know if you overheard his story ? 
Professor , you should be in the Herbal Medicine class now 
Do not worry about that , Potter . 
Be in the office of the teacher , invite 
Harry followed him , wondering what was going to happen to him now . 
If Moody wanted to know how he knew about the dragons , what would he know ? 
Did Moody meet Dumbledore Hagrid ? Or just turn Harry into a weasel ? 
Oh , Harry thought sadly , if it was a coterie , it would have been easier to cross the dragon , it would have been smaller , and the dragon's eye would have been more difficult to see at the height of seventeen . 
He followed Moody to his office . 
Mr. Moody closed the door and turned to look at Harry . 
Both his eyes and his magical eyes stare at it . 
Moody quietly said : 
You've done a very good job , Potter . 
Harry did not know what to say ; This is not the reaction it waits for in the teacher . 
Moody says it : 
Sit down . 
Harry sat down , looking around . 
She had come to this office under two previous anti - artistic anti - art teachers . 
In Professor Lockhart's time , the walls were covered with Lockhart's own flashy smileys . 
When Lupine is living here , the prospective student encounters some strange new dark creature that he collected for his pupils to learn in class . 
But now , this office is full of monstrous objects that Harry guesses that Moody used when he was a god . 
On his desk there was something like a big glass crack . 
Harry realized right away that it was a Hinged Glass , because it had the same look , though it was much smaller than Moody's . 
In a corner of the room , on a small table , there was another thing that looked like something like a jumbo gold telescope antenna . 
That is softening . 
And on the wall opposite Harry hung one that looked like a mirror , but did not reflect the room . 
In the shadowy shadows of moving around , there is no clear picture . 
Moody looked at Harry face to face . 
Master asked : 
Do you enjoy the dark machine ? 
Harry pointed at the jolted yellow antenna : 
Teacher , what is that ? 
The Secret Machine . 
It vibrates and vibrates every time it detects a secret or a lie , but of course it does not matter , because there is so much noise involved : pupils all around lying about . The reason they do not do the homework . 
From the school teacher until now , it is vibrating crooned without rest . 
The lense of his teacher is constantly hissing so harsh that he must disable it always . 
It was so sensitive , it tasted the whole thing happening around here miles . 
Moody growled , 
Of course , in addition to the three children's stories , it taunted everything else . 
What is the glass used to do that teacher ? 
Well , that's the Mirror of the Master . 
Do you see them are lurking around here ? 
As long as you still see the white of their eyes , you are not completely in trouble . 
If the real trouble , then he opened the chest of the teacher . 
He laughed , a hollow laugh , and pointed down at the large chest placed under the window . 
The chest has seven locks in a row . 
Harry wondered what was in it until Moody's question dragged him to reality : 
So .. you have discovered the dragon , right ? 
Harry is embarrassed . 
He had been afraid of this for a while - but he did not tell Cerdic and it certainly would not tell Moody that Hagrid had broken the rules . 
Mr. Moody sat down , extending his wooden leg with a soft moan . 
No problem . 
Cheating is a traditional part of the Magic Trilogy and since that time it has been so . 
" I do not cheat , " said Harry . 
It is by accident that you know . 
Moody laughed . 
You do not accuse me , baby ! 
He had always said to Dumbledore at the beginning , that he could keep the noble soul as he liked it , but the fish masters Maxime and Karkaroff were not . They will pass on to their chickens what they can infuse . 
They want to win that . 
They want to beat Dumbledore ! 
They want to prove that Dumbledore is nothing but ordinary . 
Moody laughed again , and the magician's magic eye was so fast that Harry felt dizzy as he followed it . 
Mr. Moody says : 
Do you have any idea what you're going to do over my dragon ? 
Harry said : 
Yes . 
Moody said flatly : 
Well , I will not tell you . 
I do not bias teachers . 
I will show you some good advice around . 
And the first tip is - let's play with your strength . 
Harry jerked his mouth out to keep his mind : 
What is your strength ? 
Brother Moody raged : 
do not interrupt 
If you say you have strength , then you have strength . 
Now think about it . 
What is the best ? 
Harry tried to concentrate . 
What is the best thing about it ? 
Ah , this is easy , yes It's sadly said : 
Quidditch , and a lot of help 
that's right 
Moody looked at him very closely , his magical eye almost unmoving . 
He continued : 
As you have heard , you are a good fly . 
Harry looked up at his master : 
Yes , but you are not allowed to bring a broom , you only have a wand 
He interrupted , saying loudly : 
Your second general advice is to use a simple , nice mantra that you can get the baby you need . 
Harry looked blankly at him . 
What does it need ? 
Moody whispered : 
Thinking of them to combine them is not so hard to do so 
And Harry understood . 
He is the best . 
It needs to cross the dragon in the air . To do that , it needs its lightning bolt . 
And to get the Lightning Rod , it needs . 
Hermione 
Harry scrambled to Hermione as he ran to the cage house three minutes later , uttering an apology to Professor Sprout as she passed by . 
Hermione I need your help . 
Hermione looked up from the shuddering Woods trembling with worried circular eyes : 
What do you think you can do for Harry Potter ? 
Hermione needs to learn how to chant effectively at noon tomorrow . 
So are two trainees . 
They did not eat lunch , but went straight to an empty classroom , where Harry tried his best to make various objects in the room towards him . 
Harry still has some problems . 
The books and goose feathers keep losing halfway through and fall to the floor like rocks . 
Focus attention , Harry , concentrate 
Harry is angry : 
You do not see what you are trying to do ? 
A giant dragon does not know what is on its head , but try again 
Harry wanted to leave the Prophet's day to continue his practice , but Hermione flatly refused to escape the math class , and without Hermione could not do anything . 
So Harry had to endure an hour of study with Professor Trelawney . 
The teacher spent half a session telling everyone that Saturn's position relative to Saturn meant that anyone born in July would be in danger of dying . catastrophic 
Harry did not control his anger , shouting : 
Good , so good . 
As long as do not last long . 
I do not want to suffer for a long time . 
Ron looked like he wanted to laugh ; Surely this is the first time in a few days Ron has met with Harry's eyes , but Harry still feels angry with Ron so he also ignored . 
For the remainder of that session , Harry tried to draw small objects toward him by controlling his wand under the table . 
He tried to make a fly fly into his hand , but it was not entirely sure whether it was due to his magical powers or to the stupid flies . 
After the Prophet's study , Harry swallowed up the dinner , then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione , using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid touching the teachers . 
The boys practiced until midnight . 
They were even more late at night , but the Super Peeves demon appeared . 
It pretends to be Harry's , and he starts to throw his chair across the room . 
Harry and Hermione rushed out of the room before the sound of the rumbling attracted the attention of Filch . They went back to Gryffindor's common room , which was quietly quiet . 
About two o ' clock in the morning , Harry was standing near the fireplace between stuffs , books , goose feathers , overturned chairs , a scissors ball , and Neville's toad , the Trevor . 
It was not until Harry finally got hold of the Summoning Spell . 
Hermione looks exhausted but very satisfied : 
Better yet , Harry , that's a lot better . 
Harry threw a Rune dictionary for Hermione to try again . 
It says : 
Oh , now I know what to do next time , if the school does not support the charms to drag the dragon to scare yourself . 
Yeah , that's right 
He raised his wand again : 
Accio Dictionary ! ( Meaning : Dictionary , come here ! ) 
The heavy book burst out of Hermione's hand , passing through the room , and Harry snatched it . 
Hermione said happily : 
Harry , I really believe you can do it . 
Harry said : 
Just hope the charms tomorrow . 
Lightning Rods will be much farther away from the things here . 
The broom would be in the castle , and I was in the yard again 
Hermione said firmly : 
No problem . 
As long as you really focus , it's very focused on it's coming . 
Now go to sleep Harry you need to sleep so much 
Thanks to the learning minds of the Summoner , Harry did not panic that night . 
However , the next morning , the horror returned to its fullness . 
The atmosphere in the school is an extremely stressful and nervous atmosphere . 
In the middle of the afternoon , the classrooms stop giving all the students time to go out to the barn - though of course they do not yet know they can find something there . 
Harry felt alienated from everyone around him , no matter when he passed by they wished good or bad whiskey We prepared a box of tissue here , potte r . It was in such a state of intense tension that it did not know whether it would go mad when people led it to meet the dragons , and might turn out to curse anyone in sight . 
Time passes by with a more rhythmic style than ever , when it rumbles through the masses , making it feel like sitting down for the first time , the History of Magic , it is time to eat noon and then ( do not know where morning go ? 
The hours are not - where does the last dragon go ? ) Professor McGonagall hurried to her place in the hall . 
A lot of people looked at his teacher . 
Harry , the champions have to play right now . I have to get ready for the first test . 
Harry stood up , his fork touched the plate with a clang . 
Hermione whispered : 
Good luck , Harry . 
You will do well ! 
Harry said in a voice that was no longer his voice : 
Ừ . 
He left the hall with Professor McGonagall . 
He does not seem to be the professor himself ; Actually , she looked nervous as Hermione was . 
When she and her brother went down the stone steps and left the castle in the cold November afternoon , she put her hand on Harry's shoulder and said , 
Now , do not panic to hear me . 
Keeping our head awake we have wizards standing around to overcome the situation if it becomes too much trouble . The main thing is that you just have to try your best , and no one will think what's going to happen is bad . Are you kidding me ? 
Harry heard him say : 
Yes , I'm fine . 
Professor McGonagall led Harry toward the dragons on the edge of the forest , but as they approached a grove , past the groves he could see the dragon's cage clearly , and Harry saw one . The tent was erected , the tent door toward it , covering the dragons . 
Professor McGonagall said in a shaky voice : 
You will be there with the other champions and wait for your turn , Potter . 
Mr. Bagman is in there He will tell you the procedure Good luck baby 
Harry replied in a faint , distant voice : 
Thank you . 
Professor McGonagall turned away , leaving Harry to stay in front of the tent , and it came in . 
Fleur Delacour was sitting on a wooden chair in a corner of the tent . 
She was not as calm as usual , but slightly pale and sweaty . 
Viktor Krum was more irritated than usual , probably the way he expressed the tension , Harry thought . 
Cerdic is walking around . 
As Harry walked in , Cerdic smiled slightly at it . 
Harry also smiled back , feeling his facial muscles difficult to relax a bit , as if they had forgotten how to stretch out when people laugh . 
Mr. Bagman looked around Harry , cheerfully said , 
Well , Harry , good good . 
Here , here , at ease as at home ! 
Mr. Bagman looks like a cartoon character blown up in the middle of the crowd . 
He was wearing the old robes of the Oranges . 
He said cheerfully : 
Now all the contestants have been here , the time has come ! 
When the audience is crowded , I will give each bag a chance . 
He made a small purple silk bag and shook the container inside , saying , 
Each game will choose from this bag a small pattern of what you will face . 
There are different types , different , understandable ? 
And I have to tell you one more thing Well , your test is to get a golden egg . 
Harry glanced around . 
Cerdic nodded , showing himself to understand Bagman's words , and began to walk around in the tent , looking blue . 
Fleur and Krum do not react at all . 
Maybe they are afraid that they will be released if they open their mouths . That's the feeling Harry is having . 
But at least for Fleur and Krum , this is something they volunteered to do 
Soon , there were hundreds and hundreds of pairs of leopards walking across the hut , and the owners of the leopards said cheerfully , jokingly . Harry felt distant from the crowd as if they belonged . Other categories . 
And then Harry felt as if only a second later , Mr. Bagman opened the mouth of the purple silk bag . 
He handed the bag to Fleur , saying : 
Lady first . 
Fleur gives a trembling hand in his pocket and draws a perfect miniature dragon , the Green Welsh . 
He wears a 2 around his neck . 
And based on the fact that Fleur did not seem surprised at all , only a slight resignation was determined , and Harry knew he was right : Maxime revealed the chicken quiz . 
For Krum also happens to be similar . 
He drew a flaming Chinese Fireball . 
This one wears number 3 around the neck . 
Krum did not even blink , just sat back down and stared down at the ground . 
Cerdic hands in his pocket and draws a Swedish squirrel with the number 1 column around his neck . 
Knowing what was left of it , Harry reached for his silk bag and pulled out his tail . 
As Harry looked at the model of the dragon , the dragon spread its wings and smashed its tiny teeth . 
Mr. Bagman said : So the contestants have finished the topic , each of them drew a dragon that he must deal with , and that number is the number that will compete with the dragon , the game is clear . To 
Now , I'm going to have to leave the game alone , because I will be the commentator of the competition . 
Come on , Diggory contestant , you are the first competitor , just go straight to the dragon barn when you hear a whistle , okay ? 
Now , can I speak to you in a hurry ? 
Come out ? 
Yes . 
Harry faltered and stood up and walked out of the tent with Bagman . 
He led it away a distance , in the trees , and turned to look at his father's face : 
Are you okay , Harry ? 
Can you help me ? 
Harry said : 
What ? 
Yes , no , no . 
Mr. Bagman lowered his voice mysteriously : 
Do you need to plan ? 
Because he is not afraid to share with you some tricks , he said that if you want , you know . 
Mr. Bagman lowered his voice even further , saying , 
You are the loser in this competition , Harry if there is anything you can do to help me 
No need . 
Harry was so quick he knew it was a mess . 
Do not need your child to know what you will do , thank you . 
Mr. Bagman blinked : 
No one knows , Harry . 
Harry said : 
No need , I'm fine . 
He did not know why he insisted on speaking in a voice that was noisy , not knowing if it would ever be better than now . 
It states : 
I have a plan , baby 
A whistle blows somewhere . 
Damn , I have to run away . 
Mr. Bagman gasped and ran away . 
Harry went back into the hut and saw Cerdic from the tent , coming out green and blue than ever before . 
Harry tried to say goodbye as he passed by , but the sound of his mouth was just a humming sound . 
Harry sat in the tent with Fleur and Krum . 
A few seconds later , the crowd cheered , they understood that Cerdic had stepped into the barn and was now face to face with the live copy of the model he drew . 
Sitting there listening ear is worse than Harry's imagination . 
The crowd screamed as a single man with many heads , as Cerdic did something to overcome the Swedish Muzzle . 
Krum kept staring at the ground . 
Fleur now repeats the steps of Cerdic , walking around the tent . 
And Bagman's comments made things worse . Terrible images appeared in Harry's head when he heard : 
Tummy escape in the interstitial hair , only in the interstitial lines of hair only This guy , risking too clever movement is not effective unfortunately ! 
And then , after about fifteen minutes , Harry heard a deafening roar and that could only mean Cerdic had crossed over the dragon and got the golden egg . 
Mr. Bagman shouted : 
The fruit is excellent ! 
And now is the point of the Virtual Board . 
But Bagman did not read the scores ; Harry scoffed at the jury standing up for the crowd . 
As the whistle rises again , Mr. Bagman continues : 
One candidate finished , three candidates ! 
Please invite Miss Delacour ! 
Fleur shivered from head to toe . 
Up until now , Harry had felt a little farther with Fleur when she left the tent with her head held high and the wand clenched in her hand . 
Only Harry and Krum remain in the tent , sitting opposite each other , but avoid looking at each other . 
Then the same thing happened again 
I'm not sure that is not good ! 
Harry could hear Bagman screaming with joy . 
Oh almost ! 
Now be careful , I think she got it ! 
Ten minutes later , Harry heard the crowd burst into a cheering cheer again . Fleur also succeeded . 
A moment's lull , when Fleur's score was announced with more applause and then , the third , the whistle blow . 
Mr. Bagman screamed as Krum lurched out , leaving Harry completely alone in the tent : 
And now Krum ! 
Now that Harry was aware of his spirit more than usual , he was aware that his heart was beating so fast , and his fingers were numb for fear , and at the same time it seemed to escape out of itself . he , watching the tent wall , listening to the screams of the crowd , as if back from far away 
' Very bold ! 
Mr. Bagman was screaming , and Harry heard the sound of a Chinese flare sounding loudly , while the crowd held their breath . 
That's the metaphor that Krum is revealing and yes , he's got the egg ! 
The applause cheered the crumbling atmosphere like crumbling a glass . 
Krum finished the test . 
It was Harry's turn . 
He stood up , vaguely aware that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallows . 
It waits . 
And then he heard the whistle blow . 
It came out , through the door of the tent , the panic was surging to the extreme inside of him . 
And now it goes through the trees , passing through a crevice of the barn . 
He looked at everything in tears as if it were a brightly colored dream . 
There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at it from the crowded arena that had been erected since it last stood in this position . 
And then there was the tail - Hungarian Hemp , standing at the end of the cage , curled up low above his hen's egg , his wings fluttering halfway through , the evil golden eyes staring at Harry . 
A scaly , dark - skinned reptile , the tail - the Hungarian Gauntlet thrashing its tail , leaving deep marks on the hard ground into grooves . The crowd was crying out loud , but Harry no longer knew it was cheering or protesting . 
Harry does not know or do not mind . This is the time when it does what it must do to concentrate its mind , completely and absolutely , on its unique opportunity . 
He raised his wand and yelled : 
Accio Firebolt ! ( Meaning : Lightning , come here ! ) 
Harry waited , all the flesh he hoped for , prayed for the magic spell It seemed he was looking at everything around him through a kind of transparent wall , like a hot mist , the dragons and hundreds of faces around them are a bit bobbly 
And then Harry heard the broom , hurrying in the air toward him from behind him . 
Harry turned around and saw the lightning bolt bouncing toward him . 
Around the trees , soaring in the dragon , and standing in the air next to it , waiting for it to climb . The crowd shouted fiercer than Bagman also screamed something but Harry's ears are not working anymore anymore It sounds like it's not important anymore . 
He got up on the broom and hit the ground hard . And in a second , a miracle happened 
As Harry rushed up into the air , as the wind blew through his hair , and the faces of the crowd became dots of skin underneath , and the tail - the Hungarian Lady recoiled in the size of a dog , Harry noticed He not only left the ground but escaped his fears it was returning to his familiar arena 
This is just another Quidditch match , no more than just a Quidditch match , and the tail - Hungary Gai is just an ugly player .. , 
He looked down at the egg to see the sparkling yellow egg shining among the other gray - gray eggs , resting securely between the two dragons . Harry said to himself , 
Well , tactical distraction to play only 
It's down . head of tail - Gai Hungary follow Harry . 
Harry knew what he was about to do , and it stopped falling just as a flash of fire hit the spot where it was supposed to go if it looked distracted at times , but Harry did not mind the fire that avoided it . It's not hard to avoid a Bludger 
Mr. Bagman screamed as the crowd screamed and gasped for breath . 
Dude , baby fly ! 
Hey Krum , are you watching this scene ? 
Harry shot up , flying in a circle ; tail - Gai Hungary is still tracking Harry's progress ; its head rotates on its long neck . If it does , then it will be dizzy again . 
But perhaps this should not be stretched too long , so that the dragon would spray another flame . 
Just as the dragon opened his mouth , Harry rushed down like a drop , but this time it was less fortunate : it also dodged the flames , but the dragon's tail tugged up high hit it . 
And when Harry left to his left , one of his long - thorn spines hit his shoulder , 
Harry felt the pain , he heard the screams of the crowd , but the wound did not seem deep . Now Harry flew back to the tail - Hungarian Ghetto , and he recognized a chance for himself . 
The tail - Hungarian spiny does not seem to want to fly up , it just defends the defenses to protect their eggs . 
Though he twisted himself , writhed , spat , wings spread and folded , scary golden eyes stared at Harry and the dragon still did not dare to leave his eggs . But Harry had to do it . let go of the egg , not any life approaching the golden egg The trick to apply is to be careful and slowly 
Harry starts flying , first flies in this direction , then flies in the other direction , just enough distance to let the dragon not fire away , but close enough to create a threat to the dragon . Keep your eyes on Harry . 
The head of the dragon turned all the way to the other direction , his eyes watching Harry , and his fangs grazed . 
Harry flew higher . head of the tail - Gai hung up on Harry , his neck now stretching , still swinging around like a snake charmed . 
Harry flew about a meter further , and the dragon roared an instant . 
Harry was like a fly humming a dragon's nose , a little fly that the dragon wanted to beat ; The dragon's tail flew again , but now Harry flew so high , the dragon's tail did not reach . The dragon sprayed the air in midair . 
Harry flew away to avoid the claws of the dragon spreading wide 
Try it on me . 
Harry throws the dragon , and flew off on it to lure : 
Try to get up and go 
And finally the dragon leaned forward , spreading large black feathers close to the wings of a small plane - and Harry hurried down . 
Before the dragon knew what Harry had done , or if it had suddenly disappeared , Harry rushed to his feet and rushed down to the ground , towards the hen who was no longer protected between his legs . claws of the dragon - Harry's hands also let go of the lightning bolt - it caught the golden egg 
And Harry jumped up at an extremely high speed , soaring above the stands , the heavy golden egg lay safely under his unarmed arm . 
And as if someone had just turned on the sound button , for the first time since the start of the competition , Harry had heard the sound of the crowd : the applause and the screams were as loud as the cheering of the neck . motivational team Quidditch Ireland in the World Cup . 
Mr. Bagman was shouting : 
Look ! 
Look ! 
Our hottest young champion got the fastest egg ever ! This guarantees the victory for you Pot ter ! 
Harry saw the dragon keepers struggling to subdue the tail - Hungarian Hemp , and at the entrance to the barn , Professor McGonagall , Professor Moody and Hagrid were hurrying to pick it up . Waving to her , and though from a distance , their smile was clearly visible . 
Harry returned to the stands , cheers of crowds screaming in the eardrums . 
He landed quietly , his heart softer than his mood for several weeks . He passed the exam first , then he survived . 
As Harry stepped down from the Thunderbolt , Professor McGonagall exclaimed : 
Excellent , Potter ! 
That is a profound praise of the professor . 
Harry noticed McGonagall's hand shaking as she pointed at her shoulder : 
You need to go see Mrs. Pomfrey right away , do not wait for the jury to announce the point over there , she has finished dressing for Diggory . 
Hagrid said hoarsely : 
Harry , you won pretty well ! 
Beautiful wins too ! 
And it's the tail - the new Hungarian Hem , you know , Charlie said it was the most aggressive 
Thanks to Hagrid . 
Harry told him so much that Hagrid was not too upbeat , saying that Harry had known the subject . 
Professor Moody was also very pleased ; His eyes were dancing in the eye socket . 
He said as if roaring : 
I played that trick spectacularly , it was easy . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
Potter , please go to the emergency shelter right away 
Harry came out of the barn , still breathing , and met Mrs. Pomfrey standing in the second tent door , looking very anxious . 
When Harry pulled in , she said in a disgusting voice : 
Dragon ! 
In the emergency tent divided into two compartments , Harry can see Cerdic's shadow across the curtain of the canvas , but Cerdic does not seem to be seriously injured , at least he is still sitting . 
Mrs Pomfrey examined the wound on Harry's shoulder , his mouth saying angrily : 
Last year was the Azkaban dementors , this year it was the dragon , what year did they bring something to this school ? 
The lucky thing is that this wound is not deep but needs to be cleaned before healing it 
She washes the wound by lightly rubbing a purple liquid to make the wound fuming and aching . 
Then she used her wand to poke Harry's shoulders and make the wound heal instantly . 
Now just sit still for a minute ! 
And then you can go out to see the point of the game . 
She said hurriedly out of the tent , and Harry heard her passing through the next room , asking : 
Now what's up Diggory ? 
Harry did not want to sit quietly : he was now full of excitement . 
He stood up , eager to see what was going on outside , but he had not yet reached the door of the tent , the two of them flickered : Hermione and Ron behind . 
Said Hermione , 
Harry , you're so good ! On the cheek of her still have her own nail marks because too afraid to touch his face . You make people amazing . 
Really love it ! 
But Harry was looking at Ron , who looked white now and glared at Harry as if it were a ghost . 
Ron said earnestly : 
Harry , no matter who leaves your cup of fire , I also think that he wants to harm you ! 
It sounds like the past few weeks have not happened . 
It was as if Harry had met Ron for the first time , right after he was chosen as the champion . 
Harry said coldly : 
So you understand ? 
It's that long ago . 
Hermione anxiously stood between her two friends , looking from one to the other . 
Ron opened his mouth hesitantly , knowing Ron was about to apologize to him , but he felt he did not need that apology . 
Before Harry could say anything , Harry said , 
That is enough . 
Forget . 
Said Ron : 
No , I should have 
Harry said : 
Forget it . 
Ron grinned at Harry . 
Harry also grinned at Ron . 
Cried Hermione : 
Harry looked up at Hermione . 
What's the matter ? 
Hermione stomped to her feet , tears streaming down her breast , she cried : 
Two of you are crazy ! 
And when the boys did not react , she hugged both of them , then dashed away , and sobbed happily . 
Ron shook his head . 
Barking too ! 
Come on , Harry , people are about to announce your point 
Harry picked up the golden egg and his Thunderbolt , feeling more than the feeling it could have imagined an hour ago . 
It came out of the tent , with Ron beside him , his mouth saying purple : 
You know , you are the best , do not need to . 
Cerdic does this thrilling thing by transforming a rock on the ground into a dog that deliberately makes the dragon deal with the dog instead of dealing with it , and the rain is fine , because It also took the egg , but it also burned heavily . 
The dragon changed his mind halfway , and decided to turn around , abandoning the target dog and aiming for it . 
It was only narrowly escaped . 
And that Fleur girl is trying this charm , I think she's going to hypnotize the dragon Ừ , that charm is also true , the dragon rolled to sleep , but when it snore , it breathes out the fire . her skin flushed , and she waved her wand to a little water . 
And Krum , you can not believe it , but even he can not think of a successor . 
But maybe you are the best . 
Immediately attack the dragon with a mantra . 
The only bad thing is that the dragons pounded in pain and crushed nearly half of the eggs . 
The judges have deducted points for that , because the contestants should not harm the eggs of the dragon . 
Ron sighed as he and Harry reached the edge of the dragon . 
Now the tail - Gai Hungary was taken away , Harry can see five judges are sitting right at the other end of the arena , on the high chairs covered with gold blinds . 
Said Ron : 
Each judge scores a maximum of ten . 
Harry rolled his eyes to the courtyard , seeing the first examiner , Maxime , waving her wand into the air . 
From the wand , it spits out something like a long silver ribbon , transforming itself into a giant eight . Congratulations , Ron said : 
Not bad . 
I guess she missed the woundless point on your shoulder . 
Mr Crouch's point is next . 
He shoots a nine figure in the air . 
Ron punches back Harry , 
Looks good or ! 
Next to Dumbledore . 
He also scored nine . The crowd cheered harder than ever . 
Mr. Ludo Bagman - ten . 
Harry did not believe it : 
Ten ? 
But what was his injury ? 
Ron thrilled : 
Harry , do not complain . 
And now , Mr. Karkaroff raised his wand . 
He rested his hand a little , and then a number also shot from the wand's head : four . 
Shouted Ron , 
What ? 
Four ? The croissant is full of bias , he gives Krum to ten points ! 
But Harry did not mind , if Mr. Karkaroff gave him a goat , it would not bother him . 
Ron's wrath is worth a hundred points . 
Of course Harry did not tell Ron this , but Harry's heart was so happy to fly in the air as he left the barn . 
Not only Ron alone , but also the Gryffindor crowd was screaming cheering in the crowd . 
When it came to seeing what was happening to Harry , most of the school turned out to support it and backed Cerdic . It did not bother about the Slytherins , even if they had thrown something . Harry at this time , he still has butter . 
When they returned to school , Charlie hurried to meet them . 
She said : 
You topped that table , Harry ! 
Em and Krum ! 
Listen , you have to run here , I have to run away to tell my mom what happened but the story did not really believe it ! Oh yes , they asked me to wait for a few more minutes . Mr. Bagman wanted to have some words with me , so I went to the tent . 
Ron said it would be waiting , so Harry hunkered back into the tent , the scene inside the tent now looks different : warm welcome . 
Harry remembers how he felt when he tricked the tail into the Hungarian Gauntlet , and compared that feeling with the long wait before it came to face the dragon . It could not be compared ; The wait is much worse , so far as not to be measured . 
Both Fleur , Cerdic and Krum entered . 
One side of Cerdic's face is covered with a thick orange powder , which is used to treat burns . 
Cerdic grinned at Harry as he saw it . 
Good job , Harry ! 
Harry grinned back . 
You too . 
Mr. Ludo said : 
All of you guys are good ! 
He hurried back to the tent and was as pleased as he could get over a dragon . 
Now , just a few short words . 
The rest of the girls had been resting for a long time before taking the second exam . 
This second exam will take place at nine - thirty in the morning of February 24 th . 
From here , the girls have something to ponder ! 
Look at the golden egg that you are holding , the girls you will see it is hatched , there is a pin ? 
The girls need to find the answer to that in the egg because they tell the girls what the second exam is , and can help the girls prepare . 
Everyone knows well ? 
Maybe no ? 
All right then , the ladies go away ! 
Harry got out of the tent , met Ron , and walked around the edge of the forest , talking jubilantly ; Harry wants to hear more about the other champions . 
Then , as the two walked around the dense woods where Harry had heard the roaring roar for the first time , a witch jumped out of the way . 
That is Rita Skeeter . 
She was dressed in acid blue ; spiky hairstyle She was in her hands completely in color with her dress . 
She smiled at Harry and said , 
Congratulations Harry ! 
Do not know if I can answer a few short words ? 
How do you feel when facing the dragon ? 
How do you feel about fairness in scoring ? 
Harry said in a vicious voice : 
Well , a few short words are : Farewell . 
And he and Ron left the castle . 
Chapter 21 THE FASHIONING HOUSE 
Harry , Ron and Hermione went up to the owl's cage that night to look for Pigwidgeon , so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him how he managed to get past the dragon and remained calm . 
On the way , Harry told Ron everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff . 
Although initially shocked by Ron , Karkaroff did not believe in the fact that he was a Death Eater , but when they went to the owl , Ron said they were right . 
Said Ron : 
Match well ? 
Remember what Malfoy said on the train , about his father being with him Karkaroff ? 
Now we know they know each other . 
Maybe they were wearing a mask parade in the World Cup . But , Harry , I told you , if Karkaroff had left his name , it would have been him now . how foolish , right ? 
His success is not ! 
You only get scratched ! 
Come here for me to treat it 
Pigwidgeon was so sensitive to the idea of ​​ a delivery that it kept circling Harry's head , humming constantly . 
Ron captures Pigwidgeon in the air and grabs it until Harry finishes typing the letter to the owl's leg . 
She took Pigwidgeon to the window and said , 
Other exams are definitely not dangerous , but how can it be more dangerous ? 
Do you know ? I'm aiming for you to win this competition , Harry , I'm serious . 
Harry knew that Ron just said so to compensate for his attitude in the past few weeks , but still he appreciated her . 
However , Hermione leaned against the wall of the cage , her arms crossed in front of her chest , frowning at Ron . 
She said sternly : 
Harry had to go a long way before this competition ended . 
The first test that is so dangerous , then I do not want to think about the exams to come up at all . 
Said Ron : 
Are you a good little sun ray ? 
Bo with Professor Trelawney should also be at times combined . 
Ron tossed Pigwidgeon into the air . 
Pigwidgeon scooted about four feet away and then recovered and raised his head ; The letter attached to its legs is longer and heavier than usual . 
Harry could not help but wonder how Sirius had made him mad by the way he had grown up , flying around and flying his lure tail - Hungarian Gai . 
They watched Pigwidgeon fly away in the dark , then Ron said : 
Well , now we should go downstairs for your surprise party of Harry . 
Now it must have been Fred's brother George who had eaten all the food from the kitchen . 
Indeed , when they were in Gryffindor's common room , a cheering and cheering broke out again . 
In the room there is a mountain cake , while pumpkin juice and butter beer where there is also . 
Lee Jordan exploded many bursts of fireworks that filled the space with stars and sparkles . 
And Dean Thomas , who is very good at drawing , has set up some impressive new banners , most of which are Harry's images of the lightning bolt flying over the dragon's tail - Hungarian Gauntlet , but also two . Cerdic with fiery head . 
Harry took his own food ; It almost forgets how extreme hunger is . 
He sat down next to Ron and Hermione . 
She could not believe she was so happy ; It was Ron who had come back to the side , and had overcome the first challenge , and within three months he would not have to face the second test . 
Lee Jordan holds the golden egg that Harry puts on the table , placed in his palm to weigh heavily : 
Oh , how heavy ! 
Open it , Harry , open it up . 
We just treat it in there . 
Hermione said quickly : 
He must find out the clue inside the egg alone . that is school rules . 
Harry whispered to Hermione , 
I was also asked to find a way to overcome the dragon alone . 
Hermione grinned . 
Many advocates of the Jorkins : 
Yeah , open it , Harry , open it up . 
Lee handed the egg to Harry , and Harry poked his fingernails in the groove that ran around the egg and rattled it . 
The egg was deep and completely empty - But at the very moment when Harry opened it , the room sounded like a horrible noise , a loud cry . 
The closest sound of this mourning that Harry had ever heard was the sound of the band's orchestra at the ghostly death party of Nick - Near - End , the band was playing the guitar together . 
Fred put his hands on his ears , screaming : 
shut it down ! 
Seamus Finnigan peeked at the egg as Harry shut it : 
What is this ? 
Sounds like the goddess of death . You will probably have to pass one of the goddesses on the next test , Harry ! 
Neville was a pallid one and spilled the chains on the floor . 
It says : 
It sounds like somebody is being tortured . 
You are going to fight the Curse of Abuse ! 
George says : 
Do not be foolish , Neville , that's illegal , People will not use the Curse of Abuse with the champions . 
I think the sound is like the English Percy sang maybe you have to attack the picture when taking a shower , Harry . 
Fred said , 
Did you eat the jam , Hermione ? 
Hermione looked at the plate Fred offered . 
Fred grinned . 
It's okay . 
He did not do anything to her . 
You just need to be careful with the ice cream 
Neville took a bite of custard cream and choked it out . 
Fred smiled : 
You play a little , Neville 
Hermione took a piece of jam . 
Then she said , 
Did you get all this from the kitchen , Fred ? 
Fred grinned at Hermione and said , 
Ừ . 
It mimics the high pitched sound of the elves : 
Get whatever you want , ma ' am , whatever ! The elves were so hungry that they gave them a roast beef . 
Hermione acted innocently asking innocently : 
How can you get into the kitchen ? 
Fred said , 
Easy ! 
Hidden behind a painting draw a bowl of fruit . 
Just take the pear and make it giggle 
Then suddenly Fred stopped talking , looked at Hermione and asked , 
What are you asking ? 
Hermione said : 
Where are you ! 
George says : 
Do you want to run the elves outside the strike now ? 
Are you going to publish the flyers to incite them to revolt ? 
Many people burst out laughing , Hermione did not respond . 
Fred warned : 
Do not make them mess up and tell them they must get dressed and get paid ! 
I ' ll make them late for cooking ! Just then Neville caused a change of mood for fun by turning into a canary . 
Fred said out loud laughter : 
Oh , sorry , Neville ! 
At the dessert cream egg that we have that charm . 
However , within a minute , the bird was out of feathers , and as soon as it was bare , the bird turned into Neville , which looked completely normal . 
Neville laughed at you : 
Fred proclaimed to the excited little crowd : 
This cream cake here ! 
George and I played ourselves out - Seven Sickle , a mess ! 
When Harry , along with Ron , Neville , Seamus and Dean , went to their bedroom , it was one o ' clock in the morning . 
Before pulling up the curtain around the piling bed , Harry left the miniature model of the tail dragon - Hungary on the table next to the bed , then yawned , curled up and closed his eyes . 
Harry just pulled the mosquito , thinking , Hagrid turned out to be justified , the dragons , in fact , they are also temporary 
December starts with winds and hail . 
Although designed as if it was always in the winter , the Durmstrang perched on the edge of the lake as it crossed , swirling under the gusts of wind , swirling black sails against the black sky , Harry is fortunate that Hogwarts Castle also has large fireplaces and thick walls . 
Harry thought the Beauxbatons ' mobile homes were a bit cold . 
It was noticed that Mr Hagrid was regularly feeding Maxime's horse with a malt drink . 
The smoke from the feeding troughs in the corner of their grazing grounds is enough to make the Mysterious Creature Care classful . This is a bit tainted , because they still have to take care of the monster and need to clear up the mind around the monster that monster . 
Hagrid told his students to shake during the next class of amusement park windsurfing : 
I do not know if they are hibernating anymore . 
I think we ' ll just have to try and take a look at them . We give them shelves in these boxes . 
Now there are only about ten monsters left . 
Obviously , their aspirations to kill each other are not practiced by them . 
Each monster is now more than eight feet long . 
Their thick armor , their strong thighs , their stingy tail , their stingers and hoses joined together , making the shrimps the most abominable of all . Harry has seen in the world . 
The pupils looked at the big boxes Hagrid looked at , which was covered with cotton pillows ! 
Said Hagrid . 
We just need to lead them here and then cover up , and we ' ll see what happens . 
But after the students were sweating , they realized that the monsters did not hibernate , nor did they show any appreciation for the mattress pillows stuffed in the box and pinned down . 
Soon Hagrid shouted : 
Do not panic , do not panic ! 
It was when the monster pulsed on the saddle in the pumpkin garden scattered the crushed debris of the box of disgust . 
Most of the students - led by the Malfoys , Crabbe and Goyle - entered Hagrid's hut by the back door and locked himself in there . 
However , Harry , Ron and Hermione were still among the students left to help Hagrid . 
Together they managed to restrain and tie the nine monsters with the price of scratches and burns , while the tenth child was still standing outside the circle . 
Ron and Harry used their wand to shoot light on the stubborn monster . 
This monster is approaching them with a threatening look , its curls bent , vibrating on its back . 
Hagrid shouted : 
Do not make it scare ! 
Just put the rope on the hose , so it will not hurt the others . 
Ron angry shout : 
Yes , we do not want that . 
Harry and Harry went back to Hagrid's cottage , keeping the monster a few inches from the end of the chopstick . 
Well , this game looks good . 
Rita Skeeter was leaning against Hagrid's garden fence , watching the tangled mess . 
Today , she wore a bright red scarf with purple feathers around her neck , and a crocodile leather handbag worn on her arm . 
Hagrid rushed forward to block the head of the monster that was cornering Ron and Harry at the corner and the old man scurried the monster ; a blast of fire from its tail wilted the pumpkins nearby . 
Hagrid reached over the rope of the monster and tightened it , asking Rita Skeeter : 
Who are you ? 
Rita grinned at Hagrid's bright yellow teeth and replied , 
Rita Skeeter , Prophet of the Daily Prophet . 
Hagrid frowned slightly as he resolved to make sure that the monster was somewhat impatient , stuck it in common with the other monsters and said , 
I thought Dumbledore had said he would not allow her to go on campus . 
Rita acted as if she had never heard of Hagrid . 
She grinned even more and asked : 
What are these strange creatures called ? 
Hagrid elected : 
Stingray Tail 
Really ? 
Ms . Rita exclaimed , clearly excited . 
I never heard of them Where are they ? 
Harry noticed a red color appear and surrendered under Hagrid's thick beard , Harry's heart sank . 
Where did Hagrid come from ? 
Hermione seems to be thinking in this direction too . 
She said quickly : 
Are they too cool ? 
Are not you , Harry ? 
Her feet stomped on Harry's leg , and Harry said , 
What ? Oh , that's interesting . 
Ah , are you here , Harry ? 
Rita Skeeter looked around and saw Harry . 
So I like the Care of the Magical Creatures right ? Is this one of my favorite subjects ? 
Harry states : 
Yes . 
Hagrid smiled at him . 
Ms . Rita said : 
That is cute . 
That is cute . 
She asked Hagrid , 
How long have you been teaching ? 
Harry noticed that Rita's eyes flickered over Dean's face ( a bump was rubbed across one of her cheeks ) , to Lavender ( this girl's dress was burned ) , then to Seamus ( she was taking care of her fingers ) . and then look up at the window of the hut , where the remaining students from the classroom gather , they are printing the nose into the glass , watching the situation brighten up yet . 
Said Hagrid . 
I've been teaching for two years . 
So cute I found you do not like being interviewed , right ? 
Could you share some of his experiences of the Mysterious Creatures ? 
The Prophet has a column of animals on every Wednesday , I'm sure you know . 
We can post special articles about these bullies . 
Hagrid eagerly corrected : 
The Wild Shrike . 
Oh , why not ? 
Harry felt this was not good , but there was no way he could communicate with Hagrid without being seen by Roberts , so she stood there watching silently as Hagrid and Rita arranged a fight . Have a nice interview in the week at Three Trees Bars . 
At that time the bell rang in the castle , signaling the end of the school . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione go to the castle , Rita happily calls with : 
Well , goodbye home , Harry ! 
See you on Friday night , Mr. Hagrid ! 
Harry whispered : 
She will distort everything about him to see ! 
Hermione recklessly said : 
Just hope he does not import pirated shrimp or do something illegal . 
They looked at each other - that was exactly what Hagrid could have done . 
Ron comforted : 
Hagrid had been in trouble before , but Dumbledore would never have dismissed him . The worst thing that can happen is that Hagrid will have to get rid of the monsters . 
Uh , sorry I said the worst thing ? I mean the best thing ! 
Harry and Hermione laughed and felt a little excited , and went to lunch . 
The two lessons of the Prophet that evening , Harry was absolutely delighted ; They are still learning the map of stars and predictions , but now that Ron and Ron are friends again , everything becomes so funny . 
Professor Trelawney has been very pleased with them since they predicted their own death . 
But then she quickly irritated when they laughed while she explained the different ways that Pluto could interfere in everyday life . 
She spoke in a mysterious whisper that did not hide her obvious unease : 
I think some of us 
She looked at Harry glaring impassively : 
Maybe they would have less hair if they saw what I saw during my crystal ball contemplation last night . 
At that time I sat here , hardly needing a pin , suddenly had a strong urge for me to present the idea of ​​ the globe . 
I got up , went to sit in front of the globe , I looked into the depths of crystal and you know I see what is looking back at me ? 
Ron whispered in his breath : 
Must be a big bad bat wearing oversized glasses ? 
Harry tried to hold back his grave face . 
Professor Trelawney continued : 
Death , the games . 
Both Parvati and Lavender put their hands on their mouths , looking frightened . 
Professor nodded with majesty : 
Yes , Death came , come closer , fly trousers as high as the vultures , go down low down gradually down the castle 
The professor glared at Harry with a sarcastic grin as Harry yawned a long , unbearable yawn . 
Finally , after climbing down the stairs that hung beneath Trelawney's classroom , he breathed in fresh air , saying , 
It can also be more impressive if the neck has not done it eight times before . 
But if every time I say that I'm going to die and I'm dying to death , then I must have become a medical miracle . 
Ron smiled brightly as he passed the bloody Barbarian ghost in the opposite direction with them , his eyes widening with great mourning . 
Then you will become a kind of ghost . 
At least we do not have to do homework . 
And I hope that Hermione will be given by Professor Vector homework assignments . 
When Hermione had to do something she did not have to do , I enjoyed it 
Then they went to find Hermione , but she was not present in the dining room nor was she present in the library . 
The only person in the library at the time was Viktor Krum . 
Ron lingered behind a few shelves , watching Krum , whispering to Harry that they should come to Krum to get his autograph . But then realized there were six - seven girls in the bookshelf next to them . are also discussing similar topics ; Ron lost interest . 
When he and Harry returned to Gryffindor's common room , Ron still wondered : 
Do not know where Hermione is ? 
Do not know three times . 
Mrs. Harvey had not yet thrown her portraiture to the front of the sound of footsteps rushed behind them , signaling Hermione just arrived . 
She gasped , pinning her legs to stop Ron and Harry ( Mrs. Downhill eyes down on the girl , her eyebrow raised . 
Harry , you must come , you must come , the most strange thing ever , hurry up 
She grabbed Harry's arm and started pulling it back against the corridor . 
Harry asked : 
What's going on ? 
I ' ll show you when we get there Oh , hurry up 
Harry looked around for Ron , Ron also looked at Harry , surprised and curious . 
Harry said : 
yes go 
And he followed Hermione down the corridor , and Ron hurried along . 
Mrs. Beo called out to them : 
Oh , do not count on me ! 
Do not apologize for bothering me again ! 
Can I just leave it so open that I wait for people back ? 
Ron shouted again . 
Oh thank you ! 
Harry asked : 
Hermione , where are we going ? 
Hermione led them down a six - story circuit and started down the marble stairs to enter the lobby . 
The girl said excitedly : 
You will see , a little bit you will see ! 
Down the stairs , she turned left and hurried toward the door that Cerdic Diggory had passed on the night after the fire poured out Harry and Cerdic's name . 
Harry had never been to that door before . 
Ron and Ron follow Hermione down a rocky staircase , but that staircase instead leads to a dark corridor on the ground like a staircase they still use to go to Snape's toxic room , This staircase led them to a large corridor of stone , lit by bright torches , and decorated with cheerful paintings , mostly drawing food . Halfway down the corridor , Harry slowed down : 
Oh wait , wait a minute , Hermione 
She turned to look at Harry , all over her face was the eager wait : 
What ? 
Harry said : 
I know where this leads . 
Harry nuzzled Ron's elbows and showed him the picture behind Hermione . 
The picture painted a huge bowl of silver fruit . 
Ron understood : 
Hermione ! 
Are you trying to get them in the corner ? 
Hermione said , 
No , no , I do not mean it . 
And this is not the Duck Duck thing , Ron . 
Ron frowned at Hermione : 
Did you change it ? 
Now what is it called ? 
The Liberation Front of the Family ? 
I did not bother to break into the kitchen and find the story to prevent the elite home work . 
No , I do not do it 
Hermione impatiently : 
I do not show you ! 
I came down here just to talk to them , and I noticed Oh , Harry , go away , I want to show you . 
She grabbed Harry's arm again , pulled it to the front of the silver bowl , raised her index finger , and pitted the fruit . 
The pear began to tickle , giggling , and suddenly turned into a big green door knob . 
Hermione held the fist open the door , thrusting Harry's back , forcing him to step inside . 
Harry glanced over the vast room that had the ceiling and wide as the great hall . 
Fill the stone walls of the room with bright copper pots , and at the back of the room there is a huge fireplace . 
At that moment , there was something small in the middle of the room that ran to Harry , croaking : 
Harry Potter ! 
Oh , Harry Potter ! 
At a glance , Harry almost breathed as the roar of the elf was a sharp blow to his ribs , then hugged him so tightly that he thought his ribs had broken . 
Harry gasped . 
D Dobby it ? 
It's Dobby , sir . 
Dobby here . 
The voice echoed from somewhere near it . 
Sir , Dobby was looking forward to seeing Harry Potter again , and Harry Potter himself came here to meet Dobby . 
Dobby let go of Harry , took a few steps back , looked up at Harry with a grin , Dobby's green tennis eyes were full of tears for joy . 
Dobby looked exactly like Harry's memory : a pointed spear like a pencil , ears like a bat's ears , long fingers and toes , all the same as before , except the clothes are different . . 
When Dobby worked for the Malfoys , he always wore a dirty pillow . 
But now he was wearing the strangest clothes Harry had ever seen . 
Now it dresses itself in a more monstrous fashion than the Muggle sorcerers in the Quidditch World Cup . 
Dobby had a hot pot of tea , which looked like a hat , and on that hat it had a brilliant insignia . 
A horseshoe shaped tie on the bare chest ; Dobby wears something like a barnyard pants worn to kick a ball , and a leg that wears old socks . 
Harry saw one of the two black socks that Harry had stripped of his legs to trick Mr. Malfoy into throwing Dobby , so that Dobby was freed . 
The other stockings have orange and pink stripes . 
Harry asked in amazement : 
Dobby , what are you doing here ? 
Dobby exclaimed excitedly : 
Dobby , you came to Hogwarts to work . 
Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky that job , sir . 
Harry asked again . 
Winky again ? 
Yes , sir , yes . 
Dobby grabbed Harry's arm and pulled it into the kitchen , passing between four long wooden tables . 
As he passed , Harry noticed that each of these tables was positioned right under the four rows of dormitories in the hall . 
Now that the table is empty , the dinner is over , but Harry guessed that an hour before , the dishes would be displayed on these tables and then taken straight to the tables in the hall . above , through the ceiling . 
At least hundreds of elves were standing around in the kitchen , smiling , bowing or knee - deep as Dobby led Harry across them . 
All the elves here wore the same uniform : a dishcloth with a Hogwarts badge , and a tie , which looked like a large cloak worn by ancient Roman men ; Winky used to wear it before . 
Dobby stopped in front of a brick fireplace and pointed out : 
Sir , Winky . 
Winky was sitting on a stool beside the fireplace . 
Unlike Dobby , Winky obviously did not mind experimenting with clothes . 
Winky wears a neat little shirt , a blouse that fits well with the blue hat , and the hat is perforated so that the two pointed tips of the ejaculate 
up . 
However , while Dobby's collection of exotic costumes was so clean and well - groomed that it looked brand new , Winky simply ignored the clothes that it was is wearing . 
All around Winky's jacket was covered with soups and on a skirt it had a burn . 
Harry said : 
Hey Winky ! 
Winky's lips quivering . 
Then it burst into tears , tears from his big brown eyes , falling down his chest , just as Winky cries at the end of the World Quidditch Cup . 
Hermione said : 
Oh , Winky , do not cry anymore , hold on 
But Winky grew louder and louder . 
Dobby , on the other hand , still glows with Harry . 
She said loudly , crying , crying Winky's cry : 
Do you want a cup of tea ? 
Harry said : 
Oh yes , for a cup of tea . 
Immediately , the six elves glided behind Harry , holding a large silver tray , on which was a teacup , a cup of tea for Harry , Ron and Hermione , a bottle of milk , and a plate of bread . qui big . 
Ron said in an impressive voice : 
Serious service ! 
Hermione frowns at Ron , but the elves cheer cheerfully , stooping and retreating . 
As Dobby invited the tea , Harry asked , 
How long have you been here , Dobby ? 
Dobby said happily : 
Harry Potter , just one week ! 
Sir , Dobby went to Professor Dumbledore . 
You know , an elite job is fired , it's hard to find a new job , it's hard to be true sir ! 
Winky was crying louder , more emotionally , the crooked nose of Winky's nose dripping down his chest , but it did not stop his tears . 
Dobby continues to say waist : 
Dobby has been around the country for two years , sir , trying to find a job . 
But Dobby did not find a job , because Dobby demanded a paycheck ! 
All the elves around the kitchen listened attentively , watching Dobby talk about paychecks and turned away , as if Dobby had said something vulgar , makes people very shy . 
However , Hermione said : 
You're right , Dobby ! 
Dobby held up all the teeth at Hermione to smile at her : 
Thank you very much , ma ' am ! 
But , most wizards and witches do not want an elite to be paid . 
They said , ' That's not the place of the elf , ' and they closed the door in front of Dobby . 
Dobby wants to work , Dobby wants to get dressed and wants to be paid ! 
Harry Potter and Dobby love to be free ! 
The elves around him began to run away , away from Dobby , as if he was suffering from a terrible infection . 
But Winky was still in place , though his cries had risen several times . 
And then , Harry Potter , Dobby visited Winky and found that Winky was free too , sir ! 
Dobby's voice was delighted with delight . 
But when it comes to that , Winky flung himself to the front , lying face down on the stone floor , clenching his hands to the floor and crying extremely harsh . 
Hermione squatted down beside Winky and tried to pacify her , but whatever Hermione did she could not change the situation . 
Dobby keeps his story going , trying to make a higher note than Winky's croaking cry . 
And Dobby suddenly came up with an idea . 
Dear Harry Potter . 
Dobby told Winky , ' Oh , why Dobby and Winky are not working together ? ' Where do you have enough room for two elves to work ? ' So Dobby thought , and then , Dobby thought ! 
Hogwarts ! So Dobby and Winky went to Professor Dumbledore , sir , and Professor Dumbledore received us . 
Dobby smiled brightly and tears of joy reappeared in his eyes . 
Dumbledore , Professor , says the professor will pay Dobby if Dobby wants a salary ! 
So Dobby is now a free man , sir , and Dobby earns ten galleons a week and every month is a holiday ! 
Hermione was kneeling on the floor , next to Winky crying and punching the ground . 
She cried indignantly : 
That's too little ! 
Professor Dumbledore offered to pay Dobby ten Galleon a week , and the weekend was off . 
Dobby suddenly shuddered , as if the prospect of making it frightened him : 
But daddy , Dobby paid with free Dobby , ma ' am , Dobby did not ask too much , Dobby liked to work more 
Asked Hermione , 
And how much does Professor Dumbledore pay you Winky ? 
If Hermione thought the kind words would make Winky happy , she was wrong . 
Winky did not stop crying , but he sat up , rolling two brown eyes and looking at Hermione , Winky's face was full of tears and a sudden burst of rage : 
Winky is a spoiled elf , but Winky does not have any salary ! 
Winky is not down to that level ! 
Winky is ashamed of being free ! Hermione was stunned : 
Shy ? 
But Winky , he's Crouch , is not he ? 
You do not do anything wrong , and he is too cruel to you 
But after hearing these words , Winky put two hands on the two holes on the hat , covering his ears so that he would not hear a single word . 
Winky whispered loudly : 
Do not offend my master ! 
Do not offend Mr. Crouch ! 
Mr. Crouch is a good wizard ! 
Mr. Crouch has the right to evict Winky's fault ! 
Dobby cried out : 
Harry Potter , Winky has difficulty adjusting to freedom . 
Winky kept forgetting that he was no longer bound to Crouch ; Winky was right to express his views , but refused to speak . 
Harry asked : 
So the elves do not have the right to voice their thoughts about the owner ? 
Dobby suddenly became solemn : 
Oh , you can not do that . That's part of the slave elves . 
Sir , we must keep your secret and your silence . 
We have to preserve the honor of the host family , we are never allowed to speak ill of the host family . Although Dumbledore said Dobby was not interested in it . 
Professor Dumbledore said we were free to call 
Dobby suddenly looked around nervously and shook his head , bending closer to him , letting him whisper : 
The freedom of freedom to call the tool is a monster muttered , if you like , so that's you ! 
Dobby chuckled a little fearfully . 
Then Dobby regained his normal voice , just as he shook his head , causing his ears to waved : 
But Dobby did not want to call that , Harry Potter . 
Dobby liked Dumbledore very much , sir , and Dobby was proud to keep his secret and his silence . 
Harry grinned . 
But now you can say anything you like about the Malfoy family ? 
A look of dread glimpses Dobby's manipulative eyes . 
Dobby Dobby can . 
Dobby's tone is somewhat uncertain . 
He has his tiny shoulders . 
Dobby can tell Harry Potter that Dobby's former boss is the evil Dark Witch ! 
Dobby stood there for a moment , trembling with his own wild despair . Then he dashed to the nearest table and slammed his head on the table , slamming his waist : 
Bad dobby 
Dobby spoiled ! 
Harry grabbed Dobby's neck tie and pulled it away from the table . 
Dobby rubbed his head and gasped : 
Thank you Harry Potter , thank you . 
Harry said : 
You just need to practice a little bit ! 
Practice ! 
Winky screamed angrily . 
You have to be embarrassed yourself , Dobby , you talk about your employer like that ? 
Dobby protested : 
They are not my boss anymore , Winky ! 
Dobby no longer bothered what they thought of Dobby ! 
Tears streamed down Winky's cheeks , lamenting : 
Oh , you're a wicked goblin , Dobby ! 
Woe to my crouch , what did he do without Winky ? 
He needs me , he needs me ! 
All my life I served Crouch family , before my mother and before that my grandmother was serving Crouch family Oh , my mother and grandmother will say when I know I was free ? 
This is infamous ! 
Humiliated too humiliated ! 
Winky buried her head in her skirt and cried out : 
Hermione resolutely said : 
Winky , I'm sure Mr Crouch lives up to his goodness even without you . 
You know , we just met him 
Did you meet my boss ? 
Winky said , wanting to break , her face pale with tears rising from her skirt and her eyes bulging to stare at Hermione . 
You met my boss at Hogwarts ? 
Hermione replies : 
Yes , he and Bagman are judges in the Magic Trial . 
Is there another Mr. Bagman ? 
Winky exclaimed . 
Harry was surprised ( and through Hermione and Ron's face , he saw both of them as equally surprised ) found him again angry rage : 
Mr. Bagman is an evil wizard ! 
A very bad magician ! 
My employer does not like him , does not like it at all ! 
Harry asked again . 
Mr. Bagman is evil ? 
Winky nodded angrily , replying , 
Yeah , that's right . 
The owner has told Winky some things ! 
But Winky does not reveal where Winky Winky kept the secret of the owner 
Winky cried again . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione hear Winky sobbing in the skirt : 
Poor employer , oh my poor employer , Winky is no longer the owner of the owner again ! 
They could not make Winky say any more meaningful words , so he let go of Winky's cry and they drank for his tea , while Dobby was happy about his life . it as a freelander and plans to use his salary . 
Dobby pointed at his bare chest , happily saying : 
Dobby is going to buy a sweater , Harry Potter . 
Ron seems to have started to love this little darling , saying : 
Dobby , I ' ll tell you this , I ' ll give you the sweater my mother knit for me this Christmas , my mother always knit me a Christmas present . 
Do you have any alcohol ? 
Dobby is happy . 
Ron added : 
Maybe this will make it retract a bit to fit your lover , but it will be very similar to your warm tea pot . 
When they were about to leave the kitchen , many of the elves around them wrapped around them , offering them countless junk food to bring to the dining hall . 
Hermione refused , looking at the dissatisfaction with the manner in which the dwarves bowed and bowed before them , but Harry and Ron filled the bag of cream cakes with pancakes . 
Harry told the elves gathered around the door to say goodbye to him : 
Thank you very much ! 
See you again , Dobby ! 
Dobby hesitated , 
Harry Potter Dobby sometimes visit him is not it ? 
Of course . 
Said Harry , and Dobby beamed . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione had left the kitchen and climbed up the stairs leading up to the lobby , Ron said , 
Do you know anything ? How many years have I always admired Fred and brother George about the two pictures of the kitchen dabs , it turned out that hard to miss ? 
The elves are ready to offer ! 
Said Hermione as she led the group up the marble stairs : 
I do not think this is the best thing for the elves , I'm planning on getting Dobby to work here . 
The other elves will see how free Dobby is , and slowly the free will flashes and fades as the dawn in their heads . 
Harry said : 
Let's hope they do not take Winky as an example . 
Cried Hermione . 
Oh , she ' ll be happy . 
But Hermione's voice did not sound so good . 
Once the shock is over she ' ll get used to Hogwarts , she ' ll see no Mr. Crouch , how much better her life is . 
Ron said it was hard for him to put a cream cake in his mouth : 
It seems she loved Mr. Crouch . 
Harry said : 
Still , she does not value Bagman very much ? 
Not knowing what he was talking about Mr. Bagman at home . 
Hermione said : 
Maybe he is not a good minister . 
Let's see what he did right , right ? 
Said Ron : 
I would rather work for Mr. Bagman than under Mr. Crouch . 
At least Bagman has a good sense of humor . 
Hermione smiled slightly , saying : 
You do not let the things you say in my ears , Percy . 
Ron started to eat a long cream cake : 
Oh , okay , Mr. Percy does not want to work for someone who has a good sense of humor , right ? 
Percy would not be able to recognize a joke even if it had been dancing naked in front of him , his head just beating each of Dobby's teacups . 
CHAPTER 22 WORKSHOP 
Potter , Weasley , do you get attention ? 
McGonagall's angry voice soared like a whip across the Transfiguration class on Thursday , causing both Harry and Ron to jerk up and look up . 
It was almost time ; they finished the exercise ; The Japanese chickens were transformed into guinea pigs that had been housed in the huge cage on Professor McGonagall's table ( Neville's rat still feathers ) ; They copied the homework assignments ( Describe , for example , the ways in which the mutation was corrected when performing the Mutation Test ) . 
At the end of the class , Ron and Harry turned to the sword with some fake wand made by Fred and George ; The two of us started looking up , Ron's hand still holding a tin toy parrot , and in Harry's hand was a rubber eagle . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
Now Potter and Weasley please treat me like an adult ! 
The professor's eyes glared at them at the same time Harry's head finned quietly to the ground . 
Ron's parrot's head was cut off a few seconds ago 
I have something to say to you all . 
This traditional activity is part of the Magic Trilogy and is an opportunity for us to integrate with our foreign guests . 
This dance is only for students from the fourth year and above , although they may invite a smaller class if they wish . 
Lavender burst out laughing . 
Parvati pressed her hands to her ribs , her face looking crowded as she tried to hold back her laughter . 
They both looked at Harry . 
Professor McGonagall ignored these two , making Harry feel so unjust , that she had just rebuked him and Ron , who had not scolded her two daughters for an hour . 
Professor McGonagall continued : 
All participants in the dance must wear a formal dress , and the ball will begin at eight o ' clock in the Christmas Eve , and finish at midnight in the Hall of Fame . 
Professor McGonagall glanced around the class deliberately : 
Christmas Party is an opportunity for all of us to hang out . 
The teacher's voice did not seem to approve . 
lathong look around the classroom considerations : 
Christmas Party is an opportunity for all of us to hang out . 
The teacher's voice did not seem to approve . 
Lavender giggled even louder than before , though he clenched his hands on his mouth to hold out the laughter . 
This time , Harry could see what the two of them were laughing at . With his knuckles tucked in , Professor McGonagall looked as if she was not going to loose her hair , no matter how black or figurative . discharge gantry . 
Professor McGonagall continues : 
But that does NOT mean that we will break the pattern of behavior of Hogwarts students for a long time . 
If a Gryffindor student does tigers school , no matter what , I will be very , very unhappy . 
The bell rang , and as always , the students were picking up their briefcases and threw them on their backs and left the classroom : 
Professor McGonagall raised his voice , overwhelmed the noise of the melting classroom : 
Potter please come here she has something to say . 
Thinking that what she meant was related to the broken rubber eagle , Harry glanced at the professor's desk . 
Professor McGonagall waited until all the other students had left the classroom and she said , 
Potter , their champions and their dancers 
Harry asked again . 
What are you 
Professor McGonagall looked at Harry as if she thought Harry was joking around her . 
She said coldly : 
Friends of the ball , Potter and . His dancing partner . 
Harry's liver seemed to be scraping up and cramping . 
He felt his face was red . 
It says fast : 
Do you dance ? 
I do not jump . 
Professor rage , harsh : 
O dance , you will jump . That's what I'm telling you . 
Traditionally , their champions and dancers will open the Ballroom . 
Harry suddenly saw the picture of him wearing a tall hat , dressed in a ponytail , and had a daughter in a lace - up gown , as well as Aunt Petunia , who was always on the go . Uncle Vernon . 
It insists : 
I do not dance . 
Professor McGonagall insisted : 
that is the tradition . 
She is a Hogwarts champion , and she will do what everyone expects a school representative to do . 
So you have to find yourself a friend , Potter ! 
But you do not 
Professor McGonagall said in a clear voice to end the matter : 
Listen to me , Potter . 
A week ago , finding a dance partner with Harry was a minor affair , compared to confronting the dragon - tail Hungarian Gai . 
But now , when the dragon's story is over , just thinking about the prospect of inviting a girl to go to the dancefloor alone feels like it's better to go out with the dragon than to have fun . 
Harry has never seen so many people go to school during the Christmas holidays ; Of course , it always stays in school , because if you do not stay in school , it's only going back to the Privet House . 
But if Harry had always been in the school holidays , it would have seemed like all of the students in their fourth and last year would have stayed , and as Harry noticed , all - or at least all the girls were haunted , and surprisingly Hogwarts School had so many female students . 
Yet Harry had not noticed this before . 
The girls are now walking in the corridor and giggling and whispering to each other , and as the boys pass by , the girls burst into laughter . 
They were eager to comment on what they would wear on Christmas Eve 
When a bunch of girls about a dozen or so had passed Harry , leaned over Harry and giggled , Harry said to Ron : 
Why are they so cluttered with each other ? How can I meet a person to invite ? 
Ron suggested : 
Thrown no rope . 
But did you intend to catch anyone ? 
Harry did not reply . 
He knows very well who he wants to invite , but having the courage to invite people is another story . Cho is one year older than her , and she is so beautiful she is a very good Quidditch player . , which she is also famous for 
Ron seemed to read what was going on in Harry's mind . 
It says : 
Harry , you know , you will not have any difficulty . 
You are a champion . 
You've just beaten the tail - Hungarian Gai . 
I bet the girls will queue long to make you dance . 
For their newly reconstituted mate , Ron tried to keep the bitter taste in his voice to a minimum . 
Not surprisingly , Harry was surprised to find out that Ron was right . 
The next day , a third - year - old haircut by the Hufflepuffs invited Harry to dance with her , but Harry had not talked to her once before . 
Harry was so shocked that he refused right before he stopped to study the matter . 
She leaves , looks a little hurt , and then , during her history of Magic , Harry fights for Dean's teasing , Seamus and Ron about her . 
The next day , there were two more girls asking for it , a second - year girl and a terrible ( fifth - grader ) girl in her fifth year , who seemed to be chasing Harry a match if it was from Deny . 
Ron was a laughter and said peacefully : 
She is beautiful too ! 
Harry is still upset : 
She is three inches taller than me ! 
Imagine yourself dancing with her , look at what you like ? 
The words of Hermione talk about Krum going back and forth in Harry's head : 
They love him just because he's famous ! 
Harry is very suspicious , do not understand the girls want to dance with it still want to go to Dance with it if it is not the school's champion . 
Then he wondered if it was irritating if he called it Cho . 
In general , Harry must admit that life has been much better after it passed the first test , though the prospect of a pre - match dance made it very embarrassing . 
Now it is no longer attracting so many discomforts in the corridor as it once did , which it suspects is due to Cerdic's help - it is thought that Cerdic may have told the students of the Hufflepuff family to leave Harry alone , Thank you for revealing to the dragon for Cerdic . 
Now there are no more badges . Support Cerdic Diggory ! again 
Draco Malfoy , of course , still cites Rita Skeeter's article on Harry , whenever it is possible , but less and less of a laugh . 
And in addition to Harry's joyous poetry about the good of it now , there was no article about Hagrid in the Daily Prophet . 
At the end of the mysterious End - of - Cursillo Care session , Harry , Ron , and Hermione asked Hagrid how the interview between Rita and Rita was , and Hagrid said , 
To tell you the truth , she does not care about the Mysterious Creatures ! 
They were very relieved to see that Hagrid had stopped talking to the monsters , and the kids just huddled behind Hagrid's hut , sitting at the rough table , preparing . A selection of food for the monsters to seduce them . 
Hagrid continued the conversation with them in a low voice . 
She just wants you to talk about me , Harry . 
I told her that my nephew had been friends since he came to pick me up at the Dursleys . 
She has not scolded her for the past four years . 
Have not you ever seen him in class ? ' She never said ' , and she looked unhappy at all . 
Believe me , she wanted me to say she was terrible , Harry . 
Harry threw a handful of dragons in a large metal casket and picked up his knife to slice another , saying , 
Of course she wants it . 
She can not write about a tragic little hero like me , if it is so boring forever . 
Ron shook off the eggs of the newlyweds and said unhappily : 
She wants to come up with something new . 
She wants to tell him that Harry is a madman ! 
Hagrid looked horrified : 
But it is not ! 
Harry said gently : 
She should have interviewed Professor Snape . 
He was willing to give her anything she needed from him any day . 
' Potter has always been breaking the law since he first came to this school until now . ' 
Hagrid asked : 
Did he say that ? 
Ron and Hermione laughed . 
" Well , " said Hagrid , 
Well , maybe I broke some rules , Harry , but actually I'm not that bad , right ? 
Harry laughed : 
Come on , Hagrid ! 
Asked Ron : 
Do you go to that dance on Christmas Eve , Hagrid ? 
Hagrid said a bit : 
Oh , even though I might just pass by for a moment . 
You guessed it would be a big fun , I'm going to open the dance , right , Harry ? 
Who will you invite ? 
Harry felt himself blush again , saying : 
There is no one ! 
Hagrid asked nothing more . 
The last day of the last week of semester I became increasingly active . 
The gossip about the Dance was everywhere , though Harry could not believe half the stories . 
The rumor is that Dumbledore bought eight hundred barrels of Rosemerta's hot honey . 
However , it seems that the tool has stuck Bonds Monster . 
Who exactly is or what , Harry does not know , it never approached the witch radio system , but it came from the excitement of those who grew up listening to HTP radio . witchcraft ) that bitch is probably a famous band . 
Some professors , like Professor Flitwick , for example , have surrendered when they could not cram as many students as they could with their minds . 
The professor allowed them to play the game during his study on Wednesday , and devoted most of his time in that class to talking to Harry about the wonderful Summoning Apocalypse Harry had applied . Take the first test of the Magic Trial . 
Some other professors are not so generous . 
Professor Binns , for example , has nothing to do with him , so he stops plowing his notes on the Elves ' revolt . 
Because Professor Binns never let his death interfere with teaching , the students thought a small event like Christmas Eve could not stop him from teaching . 
And surprisingly , he could make the ebullient rebellions and bloodshed of elves sound as boring as Percy's cauliflower . 
Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody also started their studies until the end of the semester . 
And of course , during Snape's class , he did not expect to play anything . 
The professor looked around uneasily at the students , informing them that he would check them on the antidote during the last semester . 
That night , in the Gryffindor common room , Ron said bitterly : 
Evil is evil . Exhale us by test on the last day . 
Letting people learn how to smoke falls down to the end of the semester , is evil ! 
Hermione looked up at Ron through her note book : 
Um , anyway you're not exhausted , right ? 
Ron is busy building a castle with cards in his explosive bag . 
Blasting to spend time is more fun than playing a Muggle - type game , thanks to the chance that everything can explode at any time . 
Harry said lazily : 
Christmas that Hermione ! 
He was sitting in an armchair next to the fireplace , rereading his tenth flyer and cannonball . 
Hermione looked up at him , equally dignified as Ron : 
I thought you would do something more constructive , even if you did not want to learn detoxification except evil . 
Harry looks at Joey Jenkins of the Bludger , a bludger on the side of a chase chaser . 
It says : 
For example , what to do ? 
Hermione hissed . 
That egg ! 
Harry said : 
Come on , Hermione . 
On April 24 th I had to take the second exam . 
He had put the golden egg in his chest , in the upstairs bedroom , from the celebration of the success of the first test until now . 
After all , there are still two and a half months left to learn what the whole mournful cry means . 
Hermione said : 
But it may take several weeks to resolve . 
If everyone knows what the next exam is while you do not know , you ' ll be like an idiot . 
Ron placed his last two cards on the roof of the castle , and the block exploded , bristling at his brow . 
Said Ron : 
Forget it , Hermione , Harry deserves a little relaxation . 
Fred and George appeared at that time : 
Looks like Ron . 
That burning eyebrow will eat with your dress . 
Fred and George sat down at the same table with Harry , Ron , and Hermione as soon as Ron realized how damaging it was . 
George asked : 
Ron , can you borrow Pigwidgeon ? 
Said Ron : 
No , it was delivered . 
So what ? 
Fred taunted : 
George wants to invite him to the dance . 
George says : 
We want to send a letter , what to do , what a big thing ? 
Asked Ron : 
Hey , who do you write to ? 
Fred flicked his wand : 
Do not have nose to hear Ron , otherwise I will burn your nose always . 
Do you have many dance partners ? 
Said Ron : 
Not yet . 
Fred said , 
Then hurry up and move on . 
If not , then there are not many geeks . 
Asked Ron : 
So how do you intend to pair with ? 
Fred replied , no embarrassment at all : 
Angelina ! 
Ron was bounced back : What ? 
Did you invite her ? 
Fred said , 
Italy or that ! 
Fred returned , calling through the common room : 
Angelina ơi ! 
Angelina was talking gossipily with Alicia near the fireplace , she turned around and asked : 
What is this ? 
Want to go to dance with me ? 
Angelina looked at Fred as he said , 
Yes . fine ! 
Then she turned back to Alicia to continue chattering , a smile on her lips . 
Fred tells Harry and Ron : 
Wrong 
Easy . 
Fred stood up , yawned , and said , 
So we had to spend the school , George , let's go 
They left . 
Ron stopped his burning eyebrows and looked over at the ruin that was still smoking and smelling of the castle with explosive cards . 
You should work up and go , you do not understand The picture is right , you invite me to go I do not want to end up with you two couples with two raccoons where . 
Hermione made a stuttering statement : 
Sorry , what are you two ? 
Ron shrugged . 
You know I'd rather go alone than go with Eloise Midgen . 
Recently his acne has improved and he is pretty ! 
Said Ron : 
Her nose sideways ! 
Hermione was angry , saying : 
Oh I see . 
So basically you will only pick the most beautiful girls , even if she's completely crooked ? 
Said Ron : 
Oh yeah , that sounds right . 
Hermione : 
We go to bed 
And she walked to the stairs leading to her daughter's bedroom without even saying a word . 
Professors at Hogwarts are constantly striving to impress guests from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang . 
They seem to decide to decorate the castle in the most splendid way this Christmas . 
When the decoration began , Harry realized it was the first time he saw inside the castle so beautifully decorated . 
Permanent columns were applied to the marble stairs . 
The twelve annual Christmas trees in the Great Hall are decorated with everything from spherical balls to real gold nuggets ; and the armor was spell - bound to sing hymns whenever someone passed by . It is possible to hear a hollow helmet with half the lyrics , but sing the clamor Oh come on , all the loyalists 
Supervisor Filch had to deport Peeves out of a set of armor that he had to hide in there , then sit there making the chorus , listening very badly , so the wordless songs . 
And Harry did not open the invitation to the dance . 
Both Ron and Ron are both nervous now , though Harry has pointed out that there are more jumping in Ron's looks than there is no joker , and Harry is considered the one who will be opening up with other champions . the ball . 
He said sadly : 
I was aiming at all the time always crying Myrtle ghost . 
It refers to the haunted female toilet on the second floor . 
On Friday morning , Ron said , 
Harry sure we must grind our teeth to do it 
He spoke in a voice as if they were plotting to storm a fortress that could not be captured . 
Tonight , when we came back to the living room we had to have friends dance ? 
Harry said : 
Oh yes . 
But that day , every time he saw Cho - at play , at lunch , and once on his way to the History of Magic - it was as if Cho was surrounded by a bunch of friends . 
Is she never going anywhere alone ? 
Did she have to ambush her when she went to the toilet ? 
But without it , she even embarrassed three or four girls around . 
But if it does not quicken , then maybe she will be invited by someone else . 
It really did not focus on Snape's toxicology test , and the result of this dull mind was that it forgot to add a major ingredient - bezoar - and that was it . 
This means that it will be dotted . 
But it does not bother ; It is only arouses the courage to do what it is intended to do . 
When the bell rings , Harry grabs his briefcase and runs to the classroom door in the basement . 
Before he climbed up the stairs , he told Ron and Hermione : 
See you at dinner ! 
Just ask for permission to give a little talk , so that's all . It hurried across the student corridor to search for Cho , and ( sooner or later he thought ) she met her in class . Dark Arts Defense comes out . 
Can I say a few words to you ? 
Cho said : 
okay ! 
The girls around Cho started chuckling and Harry thought that it was necessary to have a law prohibiting people to giggle . 
Do not laugh . 
Follow Harry away from the ears of the classmates . 
Harry turned to look at Cho , whose stomach gushed as if he had missed a step when he came down the stairs . 
It says : 
Err 
It can not open the mouth . 
It can not . 
But it has to do . 
Standing there , looking at it , confused . 
Then the words spilled out of each other because of its tongue : 
what ? 
Asked again : 
Sorry , what do you say ? 
Invite you to dance with me ? 
Harry finished talking , wondering what it must have blushed ? 
Oh , what ? 
Oh ! 
To say , and she blushed : 
Oh , Harry , I'm really sorry . 
And frankly said : 
I accepted the word with someone else . 
Harry exclaimed : 
Oh ! 
Is a tool ; just a minute ago he felt inside his stomach a bunch of snakes , but now it sounds like it's empty , inside it looks like there's nothing left . 
It says : 
No problem , nothing . 
Let's say : 
I'm really sorry . 
Harry said : 
No problem . 
They stood looking at each other , and then Cho said : 
That's all 
Harry said : 
Ừ 
Cho said : 
All right , goodbye . 
Cho's face still blushed , she walked away . 
Harry called before stopping himself : 
Who will you go with ? 
Cho said : 
À Cerdic Cerdic Diggory . 
Harry said : 
Really ? 
Inside it began to fill up again . 
It felt as though the intestines were filled with lead . 
Completely forgot dinner , Harry slowly returned to Gryffindor Tower , Cho's voice echoing in his ear every step of the way : Cerdic - Cerdic Diggory . 
He was just beginning to enjoy Cerdic - prepared to ignore the fact that he had beaten him at the Quidditch match , and he was handsome , and well known , and the most popular champion of almost everyone . 
Now it dawned on him that Cerdic was actually a handsome man , with no head in his hands . 
She said : 
Fairy lights . 
That is the password that was changed the previous day . 
okay , wait for you , baby 
Mrs. Béo humbly , just to fix the tangle of hair , wrapped her arms in front of him to open the hole for Harry to enter . 
In the same room , Harry looked around and he was surprised to see Ron sitting in the far corner , his face gray ash . 
Ginny was standing next to Ron , speaking to him in a soft , soft voice . 
Harry approached the two brothers Ron , asking : 
What's wrong , Ron ? 
Ron looked up at Harry , a dreaded expression on his face . 
Ron silly said : 
Why do you do that ? 
I do not know what made me do it ! 
Harry asked : 
Do what ? 
Ginny says : 
The photo has just invited Fleur Delacour to dance with photos . 
Ginny looked as if trying to hold back her grin , though she still patted Ron sympathetically . 
Harry asked : 
What do you do ? 
Ron gasped again . 
Not knowing what made me do it . 
What game did I play ? 
Everyone around me - I'm crazy - everyone looks up ! 
I just walked past her in the lobby - she was standing there talking to the Diggory - and as if she had entered me or something - I addressed her ! 
Ron buried his face in his hands . 
He kept saying a few words , even though the words became increasingly indistinguishable from any language . 
She looked at herself as if she were a sea slug or something . 
Did not even reply . 
And then - I do not know - I think roughly awakened and ran the tail . 
Harry said : 
She's a girl . 
You think so . 
The maternal grandmother is a fairy , as she has charms . 
It's not your fault . 
I bet you were going to spend the time with Diggory and you were caught - but anyway , she was wasting her time . 
Cerdic will dance with Cho Chang . 
Ron looked up . 
Harry said in a low voice : 
I just invited her , and she told me so . 
Ginny's smile suddenly fell off . 
Said Ron : 
This is crazy . 
We became the last people to have no one to dance to - In , Neville . 
Hey , guess who Neville invited ? 
Hermione ! 
What ? 
Harry is completely crazy with this scary news . 
Ron's face slowly rose again as he began to laugh : 
Oh , I know ! 
He told me after the poison lesson ! 
He said that Hermione had always been a good girl , had helped her learn and other things but that Hermione told her that she had decided to go with someone else . 
Hm ! 
Wait ! 
She does not want to go with Neville alone I mean who is Hermione with ? 
Ginny said , annoyed . 
Please stop ! do not laugh 
At that moment Hermione climbed through the portrait hole and into the room . 
She went to join them and asked : 
Why do not you come down to dinner ? 
Ginny says : 
Because - Oh , you two do not laugh anymore - Because both of these guys were just de deed immediately when they open the mouth to invite people to dance ! 
That made Harry and Ron both laugh . 
Ron said bitterly : 
Thanks for listening to Ginny ! 
Hermione said with arrogance : 
Are the beautiful girls all invited Ron ? 
Now that Eloise Midgen has started to look pretty , is not it ? 
Well , I'm sure you will find somewhere that someone accepts you . 
But Ron began to stare at Hermione as if suddenly recognizing her in a new light . 
Hermione , Neville is right you're a girl 
Hermione replied bitterly : 
Well , good detection ! 
Oh - you can go with one of these two ! 
Hermione interrupted : 
No , I can not . 
Ron impatiently : 
Oh , come on . 
We need you to dance , if we do not have a dance partner , if no one accepts this with us , then we will be silly to talk . 
Now Hermione was flushed up : 
I can not walk with you because I'm going with other people . 
Said Ron : 
No , you are not with anyone ! 
You said that just to chase Neville . 
Oh , so what ? 
Cried Hermione , her eyes flashing dangerously : 
If it takes you three years to realize , it does not mean that no one else recognizes you as a girl ! 
Ron looked at Hermione , then grinned : 
OK , we know you're a girl . OK ? 
So you go with us ? 
Said Hermione , 
I said that ! 
I will go with another person . 
And the little girl went to the girl's bedroom . 
Ron looked at Hermione , bluntly : 
It's a lie ! 
Ginny said softly : 
She does not scream . 
Asked Ron : 
So who is it ? 
Ginny says : 
I do not tell you , it's her own thing . 
Ron looks extremely confused : 
OK . 
This is becoming increasingly silly . 
Ginny , I can go with Harry , and you 
Ginny flushed : 
No , I can not go with you Neville . 
When Hermione refused the photo , the photo invited me , and I thought well if I did not receive the picture then I would not go . 
I have not reached the fourth year . 
Looks like Ginny is extremely miserable . 
She stood up , walked away , her head bent down , through the portraits : 
I go to dinner . 
Ron looked up at Harry . 
She asked : 
What are the symptoms ? 
But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender getting into the portrait hole . It is time to act decisively . 
Harry said to Ron : 
Wait here . 
He got up , went straight to Parvati and said : 
Parvati ? 
Are you going to dance with me ? 
Parvati burst out laughing . 
Harry waited for the laughter to soften , his fingers crossed in his pockets of prayer . 
Finally , Parvati said , shamelessly : 
Oh , fine . 
Harry sighed . 
Thank you . 
Ờ Lavender .. do you want to go with Ron ? 
She will go with Seamus . 
Parvati answers Lavender and the two giggle more than ever . 
Harry sighed . 
He said , small voice to let Ron hear from : 
Can you think of anyone who would go with Ron ? 
Parvati says : 
Where is Hermione ? 
She goes with another person . 
Parvati was shocked . 
She asked enthusiastically : 
Carlos - Who ? 
Harry shrugged , saying : 
Do not know 
What about Ron ? 
Parvati said calmly : 
Well , my sister may know that Padma is at Ravenclaw's house . 
I ' ll ask if he likes me . 
Harry was glad : 
Oh , that's fine . 
If so can you tell me ? 
Then Harry came back to Ron , feeling the bickering was too much trouble , and he knew only the hope was that Padma Patil's nose was not too crooked . 
CHAPTER 23 CHRISTMAS EVENING 
Despite all the assignments that the fourth - year students were assigned to during the holidays , Harry did not feel interested in doing the semester when the semester ended . 
It's spent the whole week before Christmas so it's fun to play with others . 
The Gryffindor Tower was never crowded during the semester , as it seemed to have shrunk , as its inhabitants became more and more messy . 
Fred and George got a big hit with their dagger , and within the first two days of the holiday , the place was seen as a bird in the castle . 
However , soon all the Gryffindors have learned how to research the food offered by other people very carefully , to see if there is Hoang Yen cream cake hidden in the middle of the cake . 
George confides to Harry that he and Fred are doing something to develop something . 
Harry remembered in the future that in the future never accept too much of Fred and George's tricks . 
It still has not forgotten the Dursleys and Jaws . 
Now the snow fell on the roof of the castle and on the ground . 
The pale blue Beauxbatons ' mobile carriage looks like a frozen and frozen pumpkin lying next to a gingerbread house made of Hagrid's gingerbread . 
At that time , the windows on the side of the ship Durmstrang also blurred away because the ice and mast frosted white . 
The elves under the kitchen tried their best to do better than ever with a variety of hot potato casserole and deliciously tasty bread . 
And it seems that only Fleur Delacour is able to find something to complain about . 
One evening , when Harry left the hall , behind Fleur , they heard her mutter : 
Too much , all these Ogwarts . 
I will not have my face on my evening gown ! 
( Ron lurked behind Harry , obviously not to be seen by Fleur . ) 
As Fleur went out into the hall , Hermione said in a voice : 
Oh , a tragedy . 
She thinks about herself too much , right ? 
Asked Ron : 
Hermione , who are you going to dance with ? 
Ron asked that question with Hermione , hoping to skip the question when Hermione was less likely to be able to get the answer . 
But Hermione only frowned , saying : 
I do not tell you . 
You are only good at making fun of me . 
Malfoy goes behind them , 
Did you say weasley ? 
Do not tell me that someone is going to invite that thing to dance ? 
Maybe not a Muggle jaw ? 
Both Harry and Ron swung around , dashing into Malfoy , but Hermione loudly waved to someone behind Malfoy : 
Dear Professor Moody ! 
Malfoy's eyebrows are irregular and he jumps back and forth , glancing around at Professor Moody . 
He was still sitting at the professor's desk eating casseroles . 
Said Hermione harshly . 
How do you go about getting a cockerel , Malfoy ? 
The three of us continued to walk up the marble stairs while laughing . 
Ron glanced at Hermione beside him , serious of course : 
Hermione , your teeth 
Hermione asked : 
What about your teeth ? 
Ờ they are slightly different I just noticed 
Of course , your teeth are different so you think you should keep the fangs that Malfoy had tasted themselves ? 
No , I mean they are different than before even when he's a guy . They are neat and normal size . 
Suddenly Hermione smiled mischievously and Harry realized : It was another smile with the smile that he remembered before . 
Hermione said : 
When I came to Mrs. Pomfrey to collect her small teeth , she held up a glass in front of her and told me to see her teeth return to normal shape , she said stopped . 
So I just need to let her do a bit too . 
Hermione smiled , a broader smile , 
Your mother will not be happy at all . 
For a long time I insisted my parents to shrink my teeth , but my parents wanted to wear a pair of teeth . 
You know , my parents are dentists , they simply think of teeth with magic is Sister ! 
Pigwidgeon was on ! 
Ron's tiny owl was creaking like crazy on a snow - covered parapet , his legs tying a roll of parchment . 
Those who walked by it pointed and laughed , even a group of girls in the third year stopped and said : 
Oh , look at that little owl ! 
Is it cute ? 
Ron hurried up the stairs to catch the owl , he hissed : 
idiot ! 
You take the letter to address , not to be around here to show off ! 
Pigwidgeon giggled happily , his head poking out Ron's fist . 
The third year girls looked so terrified . 
Ron swung his fist holding Pigwidgeon , and cursed the girls with curiosity : 
go away ! 
The little owl fluttered into the air and hummed more excitedly than before . 
As the girls pulled away with a great outrage , Ron said in a small voice : 
Take it , Harry ! 
He pulled Sirius's reply from his paw at the foot of the owl and Harry tucked in his pocket , all three hurried back to the Gryffindor Tower to read . 
Everyone in the common room is too busy with holidays , so it does not matter what people do . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione sat next to a darkened window that was slowly falling into the snow , separating from the rest of the room , and Harry read the letter : 
Harry loves you . 
Congratulations to you have overcome the tail - Gai . 
Someone who has dropped his name in the glass is certainly not able to cheer at this time . 
He intended to teach the mantra of the Covenant , because the eye is the weakest of the dragon . ( Hermione whispered : that's what Krum did ! ) But the way you did it was better , very impressive . 
Do not be proud , Harry . 
You only have one test ; Those who have dropped their children in the Fire have plenty of opportunities if they deliberately hurt their children . 
Open your eyes to alertness - especially when the person we talked to is still around you . 
And focus on keeping you safe from any trouble . 
Keep listening to your child . 
I still want to know about unusual things . 
Sirius . 
Harry put the letter in his pocket , quietly said : 
How is that identical to Professor Moody ? 
Stay alert regularly . 
As if I go around with eyes closed and then head to the wall is not equal 
Hermione said : 
But Sirius was right Harry ! 
You also have to do two more tests . 
You should really look at that egg , you know , and you should start to understand what it means . 
Ron interrupted : 
Hermione , Harry has a lot of time . 
Hey , Harry , go play chess ? 
Harry said : 
Yeah , play ! 
Recognizing the disapproving look on Hermione's face , Harry said , 
Well , Hermione , how can I concentrate while surrounded by such noisy ? 
I will not be able to hear the egg between these busts . 
Hermione sighed : 
Oh , I think so too . 
She looked down at her two children playing chess . 
The game reached its climax when Ron flashed his face , affecting two brave and brave bishops . 
On Christmas Day , Harry wakes up very suddenly . 
He opened his eyes , wondering what had made him suddenly awake like that , seeing something with big round green eyes staring at it stupefied in the dark , looking so close his nose touched Harry's nose . 
Dobby ! 
Harry screamed , crawling out of the goblin so fast he almost fell out of bed . 
do not do that 
Dobby exclaimed loudly , 
Dobby , sorry . 
He jumps back , his long , striped fingers panting : 
Sir , Dobby just wanted to wish Harry Potter a happy Christmas and give him a gift ! 
Harry Potter says Dobby can visit him occasionally , sir . 
Harry was still breathing normally , while his heart was beating the beat . 
OK , Dobby . 
Only later do not stab yourself or do the same thing , it's all right , do not lean on him so 
Harry pulled the curtain around his bed , took his glasses to the side table , and put them on . 
Harry's scream awoke Ron , Dean , Seamus and Neville . 
All of them poked their heads out of the crevices between the curtains that hung around the bed . 
Seamus asked sleepily . 
Are you attackers , Harry ? 
Harry grunted : 
No , just Dobby . 
Sleep back . 
But Seamus saw the pile of presents lying at the foot of his bed , shouting : 
No present ! 
Ron , Dean , and Neville also decided that they were completely awake now , and they started to open their presents . 
Harry turned back to Dobby , who was in a rush , and stood beside Harry's bed , anxious as if it had just made Harry angry . 
At the tip of the tea pot , Dobby suddenly had a flashy bow . 
Said Draco with a strained voice : 
Can Dobby give Harry Potter gifts ? 
Harry said : 
Of course . 
Oh yes I have this for you . 
That's just saying it ; Harry had not bought anything for Dobby , but he quickly opened the chest and pulled out a mountain of socks piling each other into the beam . It was Harry's oldest stockings , the mustard yellow , and once belonged to Uncle Vernon . 
The reason they have been knobbed in such a way is that Harry used them to glaze on his Tactical Lens for nearly a year . 
Harry took the tip of the lens and handed Dobby an old dagger : 
Sorry , I forgot to pack it 
But Dobby shouted , 
Socks are the clothes that Dobby likes best , sir ! 
The dear lover immediately stripped her socks off and under Uncle Vernon's socks in the leg . 
Dobby has seven pairs now , sir 
Dobby's big eyes opened with laughter , and he pulled up the length of the socks that led to the edge of his socks . 
Harry Potter , they were mistaken at the store , sir , they gave you two identical ! 
Ron sat on his bed grinning at him : 
Oh , Harry , why did not you realize it ? 
Ron was wrapped around the wrapping paper that had just been pulled out and cluttered : 
This dobby , tell you here , the part of the goblin that took these two , and you mixed them together . 
This is your sweater . 
Ron gave Dobby a pair of purple socks he had just pulled off the wrapping paper , and a weasley knit sweater and sent it to his youngest son . 
Dobby was so happy . 
Dobby's eyes widened and he lowered his head to thank Ron and screamed : 
Sir , you are so nice ! 
Dobby knew he was a great wizard , because he was Harry Potter's greatest friend , but Dobby did not care he had a great , generous , altruistic soul . 
Ron saw that his ears were slightly reddened , though he was happy , saying , 
Just some socks , Dobby , it's worth it ! 
Oh Harry ! 
Ron had just opened his gift to Harry : a Chudley Cannon fan's hat . 
Ron hugged his head on his head , his messy red hair seeming dissatisfied with the hat . 
Exclaimed Ron : 
great ! 
Then Dobby gave Harry a small package , opened the package to see socks . 
Dreamy love said : 
Sir , Dobby made it for you . 
Dobby bought his own wages , sir . 
The scarlet left socks and the brush on the socks , while the right socks are green and have a yellow snitch pattern . 
Harry said : 
They're all alright , thank you so much Dobby . 
Harry brought the two socks in the foot that made his eyes dwelling dwarf happiness . 
Dobby , come on now , we're preparing a Christmas party in the kitchen ! 
Dobby finished hurriedly out of the boys bedroom , waving Ron and the other boys as they passed by . 
Other gifts made Harry happier than Dobby's two socks - of course , excepting the Dursleys gift that used to be a paper towel and was always the worst . 
Harry is sure they still remember the tongue sweets in the summer . 
Hermione gives Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of England and Ireland . 
Ron gave him a bag full of Bom - feces ; Sirius offers a tweezer with miscellaneous items that can open any lock and remove any knots . 
And Hagrid gave Harry a huge box of candy , including the candy that Harry liked most : Bertie Bott's candy , Frog's Chocolate , Drooble's most exquisite candy , and Honey Candy . 
And of course , there was also a package of Mrs Weasley's familiarity with a sweater ( blue with a dragon on it , Harry guessed that Charlie had told Mrs. Weasley everything about the dragon - Hungarian Veggies ) , and Mrs. Weasley's home - made mince pies . 
Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room and they all went down to the hall to eat breakfast . 
All morning they were in the Gryffindor Tower , where everyone enjoyed the Christmas presents and then went back down the hall to a coma lunch , consisting of at least a hundred turkeys and cakes . Christmas , along with the heap of Cribbage's witchcraft fireworks . 
After lunch they went out to the playground , the snow was still empty except for a deep groove that Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students stamped on to the castle . 
Hermione likes to sit and watch Harry and Ron play snow globe rather than join in the game , and by five o ' clock , Hermione tells her to go to the bedroom to prepare for the ball . 
Ron looked at Hermione suspiciously . 
What to do with the three hours of preparation ? 
It paid for the distraction of the mind because of that curiosity with a snowball flying straight in the air , thrown by George on his head . 
Ron did not give up , screaming at Hermione : 
Who are you with , Hermione ? 
But Hermione waved her hand and disappeared from the stone steps leading up to the castle . 
Today there is no Christmas Tea Party , because the party will include a night party , so at seven o ' clock , they find it hard to concentrate on the goal , the others have dropped . A snow - throwing game in which you pull together into the castle . 
Mrs. Beo was sitting in the picture frame with her friend Violet in the picture below the house to visit , both of them were drunk , the cans of chocolate drifted squeaky at the bottom of the picture frame . 
When the students read the password , Mrs. Griggs giggled and fumbled forward so they could get through the hole . 
Fairy lights , that's the password ! 
Harry , Ron , Seamus , Dean , and Neville were dressing up in the boys ' bedroom , all of them seeming very self conscious , though Ron was not exactly pleased . 
He studied it in front of the long mirror in the corner of the room with a look of horror . 
There is no way to deny the fact that Ron's dress is more like a dress than anything else . 
In a desperate attempt to make the dress more manly , Ron cast a fine charm on the lace fringes lace around the shirt . 
Not so bad at all , at least now Ron has escaped some lace awards , although Ron's doing the job of repairing the dress is not very clever , so many lines still seem frayed . 
As the boys pulled together down the stairs , Dean grunted : 
I still can not understand the two girls how to invite the two most beautiful girl of the year . 
Ron dragged the thread on his tuxedo , groaning , 
By the charm full of beast . 
The common room looked strange , full of people dressed in color instead of a bunch of students in black uniforms as always . 
Parvati is waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs . 
She looked so beautiful in her flamboyant pink dress with long dark brown braids , the gold pendant she wore in her wrist . 
Harry was relieved to see Parvati not giggling like crazy the other day . 
It said embarrassingly : 
You look so pretty . 
Parvati says : 
Thank you . 
Then she said to Ron : 
Padma will meet you in the Lobby . 
Ron looked around , saying : 
OK . 
See where Hermione ? 
Parvati shrugged : 
Can we go down , Harry ? 
Harry wished he could stay in the living room a little longer , but he said , 
OK . 
Fred winked at Harry as he passed this guy to the portrait hole . 
The hall was full of students , all of them waiting around eight hours , when the door to the hall opened . 
Those who have dancers are other dormitories who are wading through the crowd to find each other . 
Parvati earns her sister , Padma , and takes her sister to Ron and Harry . 
Padma said : 
Hello guys . 
Padma is as beautiful as her sister in a turquoise turtleneck . 
However , she does not seem to be as enthusiastic as Ron's dancer ; Her black eyes fluttered from the back of her thigh to the sleeveless shirt of Ron's dress and looked up at Ron from head to toe . 
Ron did not dare to look at her , only to stare at the crowd , replying : 
Hello . 
Alright 
Ron kneeled down to hide behind Harry , because Fleur Delacour was walking past them , splendidly dressed in silver - gray satin dresses , accompanied by Ravenclaw's Quidditch Captain Roger Davies . 
When they were gone , Ron just stood up and looked back over the crowd . 
It poses the question again : 
Where to see Hermione ? 
A group of Slytherin students are walking up the stairs from their common room in the basement . 
Malfoy took the lead ; He wore a black velvet suit with a high collar , which made Harry feel like a pastor . 
Pansy Parkinson in a pale pink dress was wearing Malfoy's arm . 
Both Crabbe and Goyle were dressed in green attire , both of whom looked like two moss covered stones , and Harry was glad to find that they did not find any friends . 
The oak doors opened , and everyone turned to look at the Durmstrang schoolmate entering with Professor Karkaroff . 
Head of the delegation is Krum , a pair of beautiful girl in blue dress that Harry does not know . 
Looking over the heads of the Durmstrang students entering the lobby , Harry could see the front lawn , the castle's right had been transformed into a fairytale - like cave - that is , hundreds of real fairies . She was sitting in the newly blooming rose bushes . 
The fairies fluttered over the statues of something like Santa Claus and his deer chariot . 
And then Professor McGonagall's voice resounded : 
Please invite the top up . 
Parvati corrected his bracelet , smiled brightly . 
The girl and Harry told Ron and Padma : 
See you later . 
The crowd was rattled off for Harry and Parvati to pass . 
Professor McGonagall wore a red diagonal dress and wore an ugly rough wrap around her hat . 
She told the champion and her partner to wait outside the door as the others pulled into the hall . 
When all the students are sitting there , the champion and the jumper will march into the hall of the ritual . 
Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stood near the entrance . 
Davies has 
It seemed too dizzy to be Fleur's dancer , so that he could not take his eyes off her champion . 
Cerdic and Cho stand very close to Harry . 
He looked away to avoid talking to them . 
At that moment his eyes caught her standing beside Krum . 
He gasped . 
That girl is Hermione ! 
But she does not look like Hermione at all . 
She did something with her hair , which made her no longer ruffled and became smooth and shiny in ribbons on her forehead . 
She was dressed in a dress that was blue in color and was bobbing like a cloud . 
And somehow she made herself look different . 
Or perhaps it was because of the lack of books on under twenty dozen books that she often carried on her back . 
Hermione was also smiling - it was a little tense - but her small , well - proportioned teeth were really remarkable . 
Harry could not understand why he had not noticed it for a long time . 
Hermione said : 
Hi Harry , greet Parvati ! 
Parvati looked at Hermione with an unbelievable expression of sincerity . 
And Parvati was not the only one who was so amazed . 
When the door to the great hall opened , Krum's fan club from the library tumbled across to throw Hermione a jealous look . 
Pansy Parkinson gasped at Hermione as she and Krum walked past , and even Malfoy could not find an excuse to offend Hermione . 
Ron went straight through Hermione's face without looking at her . 
When everyone was in the hall , Professor McGonagall told his champions and dancers that they were going to line up and follow her . 
All of them followed and the crowd in the hall applauded warmly as they walked in and started walking towards the large round table set right at the top of the hall . 
The judges were sitting there . 
The walls of the hall were almost covered with sparkling silver frosting , with hundreds of wreaths and balloons decorating the ceiling that had been spellcasted into a starry sky . 
The rows of the houses have disappeared ; Instead there are hundreds of smaller tables , each of which can seat about twelve , and each table is lit with lanterns . 
Harry concentrated in his footsteps to avoid going too fast . 
Parvati seems to be very satisfied . 
She was smiling around everyone , driving Harry so vividly that it felt like it was a dog she was putting on display . 
It caught Ron and Padma's eyes as he approached the first table . 
Ron was watching Hermione walk across it with narrowed eyes . 
Padma showed a pout . 
As the champions approached the first table , Dumbledore was smiling cheerfully , but Karkaroff was wearing a face that looked remarkably like Ron's face as he watched Krum and Hermione approach . Ludo Bagman was wearing a bright purple evening dress with big gold stars , and he was as fierce as any student ; And Maxime changed her regular black satin dress into a lavender silk dress . 
She also applauded politely . 
But Harry suddenly noticed that Crouch was not among the judges . 
Sitting in the fifth chair on the judge's table is now Percy Weasley . 
As the champion and the friend jumped to the table , Percy pulled an empty chair beside him and stared at Harry . 
Harry understands Percy's implication and sits down beside him . 
Today , Percy was wearing a brand new blue suit and showing the complacency that Harry thought was worth it . 
Before Harry could ask , Percy opened his mouth and said , 
You have just been promoted . 
Based on Percy's voice , he is likely to announce his election as the supreme commander of the universe . 
He is now Crouch's personal assistant , and he represents him here . 
Harry did not expect to lecture on the bottom of the cauldron during dinner . 
She asked : 
Why did not he come ? 
He is very upset to say that Mr. Crouch is not very well , not well . 
Since the World Cup he was not well . 
Not surprisingly - he worked too hard . 
He is not as young as he is - even though he is intelligent , of course , his mind is still as great as ever . 
But the World Cup was a failure for the whole of the Ministry , and then Crouch suffered a further personal shock from the ugly behavior of his elf , the Blinky , what . Of course , he got rid of the elf , but oh , as he said , he had to live and work , he needed care , and he thought he had fallen into a certain shortage in life . At home , lack of comfort and consolation since the elf died . 
And then we organize the Magic Trial , while continuing to deal with the implications of the World Cup - which brings about the widespread skepticism of the Skeeter witch . 
You deserve a happy Christmas ! 
He was glad he knew that someone could rely on him to replace him . 
Harry wanted to ask horrible that Crouch had stopped calling Percy Weatherby , but he was trying . 
On the gold plates there was no food , but there was a small menu placed in front of each other . 
Harry hesitantly took the menu in front of him and looked around - There was no waiter . 
But Dumbledore carefully looked down at his menu , and spoke very clearly to his plate : 
Meat - dread ! 
The fat - immediately appear . 
Understand how , the other people sitting at the table also asked the dish from the plate in front of them . 
Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and complicated dinner ritual . 
Of course , this way will spawn a lot more work for the elves do . 
But once again , Hermione seemed to think nothing of the Liberation Front . 
She is conversing with Viktor Krum and does not seem to notice what she is eating . 
Suddenly Harry realized that he had never actually heard what Krum was saying before , but now he was sure he was talking and talking excitedly . 
Van , I also have a castle , I think is not like this , nor is this comfortable . 
He was talking to Hermione . 
We only have four floors and the fireplace is only burned for magical purposes . 
But I have a bigger yard than here . Although in the summer I have a few sunny days , so I do not play much in the yard . 
But in the summer , I fly every day , fly over the lake , fly over the mountains 
Wow ! 
Wow ! Viktor ! 
Mr. Karkaroff laughed , his eyes still cold . 
Do not tell everything , lest your charming girl know exactly where to look for us ! 
Dumbledore smiled , his eyes sparkling : 
Mr. Igor , keeping such secrets will make people think he does not want visitors to visit 
Karkaroff was grinning at his golden teeth , saying : 
Well , Dumbledore , we all need to protect our private territory , right ? 
Are not we obliged to guard enviously the intellectual palaces entrusted to us ? 
Do not we have the right to be proud that only we know the secret of our school , and have the right to protect those secrets ? 
Dumbledore said in a friendly way : 
Oh , I never dreamed of knowing all the secrets of Hogwarts , Mr. Igor . 
For example , in the morning , I went to the bathroom but turned to the wrong direction , and found myself lost in a symmetrical room in a way that I previously did not know , that room contains a collection The potty training is great . 
When I came back for a closer look , I discovered that the room was already gone . 
But I still look for it . 
Perhaps the only way to get to that room was at five thirty . 
Or maybe just get there when the moon crashes a quarter or when the searcher is extremely urine . 
Harry chokes in his goulash . 
Percy frowned , but Harry could have sworn that Dumbledore had winked at him a very subtle . 
Meanwhile , Fleur Delacour commented on how to decorate Hogwarts with Roger Davies . 
She looked around the flashing walls of the hall , rudely speaking : 
These are not worth it . 
In the Beauxbatons ' castle , there are ice statues all over the place in the dining room on the night of the Grotto . Of course , they are not melting . They look like the glittering diamond statues that glitter around . 
And food is full of fine salaries . 
And we have a chorus of the goddesses to make the song happy when we eat . 
We do not put ugly armor around here , and there's a goblin that dares to go to the Beauxbatons castle . 
Roger Davies listened to Fleur Delacour with a dull face , and he put the fork in his mouth . 
Harry felt that Davies was too fussy about Fleur to swallow her words with her mouth swallowed , not flushed food for her mouth to chew . 
Davies patted his hand down the table with a fake impromptu to Fleur , he said quickly : 
Exactly ! chase , right ! 
Harry looked around the hall . 
Hagrid sat at one of the teachers ' desks ; He wore brown hair and looked up at the table . 
Harry saw him lightly waving his hand , and he looked around , and saw Mrs. Maxime answering , the cat's eye jewels glittering in her candles . 
Hermione is now teaching Krum to read her name correctly , because he kept calling her Hermyown 
Hermione said word for word : 
Her - oh - nee . 
Herm - own - ninny . 
Said Hermione , caught Harry's eyes and smile : 
Alright . 
After the food and drink was consumed , Dumbledore stood up and asked the students to follow him . 
And then with a waving wand , he made all the tables come back along the walls , leaving the floor of the empty hall empty , and then the sorceress turned out to be a raised stage . Up on the wall to the right of the hall . 
On the stage appeared a set of drums , many guitar - a flute , a giant lake , and some bags . 
The Band of Monsters is pulling the group to the stage in the middle of the applause to welcome the resounding heat ; The Monster Hair is a shaggy hair and wears black robes torn to the art deco tattoo . 
They picked up the instrument , and Harry , too overjoyed to watch the Monsters , nearly forgot about the next episode . 
He suddenly noticed that the lanterns on the tables from the beginning of the party had suddenly come to a close , and the other champions and their dancers stood up . 
Parvati whispered : 
let's go ! 
We had to start the night of the dance . 
Harry stomped on his dress when standing up . 
The Band of Monsters started playing a melancholy melody . 
Harry goes to the dance floor to shine , carefully avoiding anyone's eyes ( but still can see Seamus and Dean hissing and laughing ) And in a split second , Parvati grabbed two hands of Harry , put one of her hands on her waist , and the other hand was clenched by her hand . 
It's not as bad as the worst situation it can ever imagine . 
Just slowly rotate around a place ( according to Parvati ) . 
He kept looking at the heads of the people who were watching , and soon many of those people walked to the dance floor , making the champions no longer the center of attention . 
Neville and Ginny were dancing near Harry - he could see Ginny often frown as Neville stepped on her leg - and Dumbledore was dancing with Maxime . 
Compared to Maxime , he looked like a dwarf , the tip of a pointed hat that he just reached Maxime's chin . 
However , with such massive body , Mrs. Maxime still go gracefully graceful steps . 
Moody Eyes - Crazy , extremely fierce dance two to four four with Professor Sinistra , this teacher anxious to dodge the foot of his teacher . 
As he passed Harry , Moody shone his magical eye in the costume that Harry was wearing , snarling : 
Too beautiful socks , Potter ? 
Harry grinned : 
Yes , Dobby is a self - made knack as a Christmas present for that child . 
As Moody twisted and stepped away , Parvati whispered : 
He is so angry 
I do not think that eye is allowed to see ! 
Harry heard the last of the trumpets resounding with relief . 
The Monsters stopped playing , the applause echoed through the hall again , and Harry let go of Parvati . 
Do we sit down ? 
But this song is great ! 
Parvati said that when he gave the instrument back to perform a new song , rhythm faster than a few . 
No , I do not like this one . 
Harry lied and took Parvati out of the dance floor , passing through Fred and Angelina , who were jumping so passionately that the people around them stepped back , fearing the two of them would fall in love . 
Harry led Parvati straight to where Ron and Padma sat . 
Harry sat down , opened a bottle of avocado and asked Ron : How do you eat ? 
Ron did not answer . 
It was staring at Hermione and Krum dancing nearby . 
Padma crossed his arms cross - legged , a foot beat to the beat . 
Sometimes she throws an angry look at Ron . 
Ron did not pay attention to her . 
Parvati sat down next to Harry , crossed his arms crossed , but within minutes she was greeted by a young man from the Beauxbatons group . 
Parvati says : 
You do not mind , Harry ? 
Harry was watching Cerdic and Cho , 
What ? 
Parvati interrupted : 
Oh no ! 
And she flushed out to the dance floor with the Beauxbatons . 
When the song ends , Parvati does not return . 
Hermione went to sit down at Parvati's vacant chair beside Harry . 
Her face rose slightly from the dance . 
Harry said : 
Hello . 
Ron did not say anything . 
Hermione swung her hand to her own fan . 
She said : 
Too hot ? 
Viktor took a drink . 
Ron looked at Hermione scornfully . 
It says : 
Mr. Viktor ? 
Did not you call me Vicky ? 
Hermione looked at Ron in surprise . 
She asked : 
What's wrong Ron ? 
Ron said harshly : 
If you do not know , let me tell you . 
Hermione looked at Ron and looked at Harry , but Harry shrugged and did not seem to understand . 
Ron , what ? 
Ron spit : 
He's from Durmstrang ! 
He is against Harry ! 
Against Hogwarts ! 
That's true 
Obviously , Ron is struggling to find words powerful enough to portray Hermione's sin : 
Party with the enemy . 
You are doing that . 
Hermione's mouth gaped open . 
A moment later , Hermione said , 
do not have a clue ! 
Enemy ! 
Who is the eager enthusiastic person when he comes here ? 
Who would want his autograph ? Who is the one who has a statue of his child in the bedroom , open ? 
Ron decided to ignore that . 
Surely he had asked you when you two were in the library ? 
Hermione's cheeks pinkish . 
right . 
So what ? 
What happened to you asking him to join the Liberation Front of the Household ? 
Are not . 
If you really want to know , I tell him , he tells him to go to the library every nod to find a way to talk to me , but he can not make enough courage ! 
Hermione said the words were very incense , and her face was so red that her face was the same color as Parvati's dress . 
Annoyed Ron said : 
Well , so is he saying that ? 
And what does that mean for you ? 
Too clear ? 
He is Karkaroff's student , right ? 
He knew you were making fun of him trying to reach Harry - trying to get Harry's information , or finding a way to get close enough to him . 
Hermione seems to have just slapped Ron . 
As she opened her mouth , her voice was trembling . 
You know , he never asked me anything about Harry , not a single thing Ron changed reasoning like a hurry . 
Then he is hoping you will help him find meaning in his egg . 
I'm sure he and his head were together in that cozy little library 
Hermione angry can not describe , said loudly : 
I did not help him about the egg ! never . 
How can you say such words ? I want Harry to win this Magic Trilogy . 
Harry knew that , did not Harry ? 
Ron still mocking : 
Then the way of expressing that desire of humor is so great ! 
Hermione's voice grew hotter : 
The whole of this competition is to create understanding and friendship with foreign witches and wizards ! 
Shouted Ron : 
Not ! 
The game is to win ! 
The people around him stood looking at him . 
Harry whispered : 
Ron , I do not see a problem with Hermione's communication with Krum . 
But ignoring Harry , Ron said , 
Why do not you go look for Vicky , he's probably wondering where he's crawling ? 
Do not call him Vicky ! 
Hermione stood up and jumped across the dance floor , disappearing into the crowd . 
Ron looked at Hermione with an angry expression on his face . 
Padma asked : 
After all , did you invite me to dance ? 
Are not . 
Ron said curtly , eyes still following Hermione . 
Padma : 
Good . 
She got up and went to join the Parvati with the Beauxbatons . 
They quickly found a guy who had not had a friend to join in with , so quickly that Harry swore that only the Trident Tap would pull some guy so fast . 
A voice said suddenly : Where is Herm - own - ninny ? 
Krum went to their table , holding two bottles of beer . 
Ron looked up at him , stubbornly said : 
Do not know ! 
Did you lose her ? 
Krum retrieved his irritation all the time . 
Well , if you see her , please tell her I've got a drink . 
Then he walked away . 
Percy whispered , rubbing his hands together , incredibly swift : 
Are you friends with Viktor Krum and Ron ? 
Excellent ! That is the whole point of the thing , you know that international magical cooperation ! 
Harry saw Percy sitting in the blank of Padma . 
The desk is now empty . 
Professor Dumbledore , dancing with Professor Sprout , Ludo Bagman danced with Professor McGonagall , Maxime and Hagrid , who were gliding around the dance floor , glancing at the students , and Karkaroff did not see . face first . 
When the next song ends , people again clap their hands together again . 
Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's hand and open the way through the crowd . At that moment , Fred and George approached him . 
Percy looked at Fred and George suspiciously , he hissed . 
They think they are doing something , daring to disturb a senior official of the Ministry ! 
No respect for anything 
But Ludo shook hands with Fred and George quite quickly ; When he saw Harry , he waved and went to their table . 
Percy said : 
Mr. Bagman , I hope my brothers and sisters do not bother you . 
Mr. Bagman said : 
What ? Oh no no ! 
No trouble at all ! 
No , they just told me more about their wigs . 
They wonder if I can help them with some marketing tips . 
I promised to help them get in touch with my clowns at Zonko 
Percy is not happy about this , and Harry is ready to fish , as Percy will tell Mrs. Weasley about this as soon as he arrives home . 
It was clear that Fred and George's plans were far more ambitious , as they hoped to sell their invention to the public . 
Mr. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something , but Percy struggled with his attention : 
Mr. Bagman , how did you see the competition ? Our department is very pleased The glow of the fire ( he glances at Harry ) is of course a little risky , but it seems that from then on everything went smoothly , do not you think ? 
Mr. Bagman said cheerfully : 
Well , yes . 
Seriously fun place . 
How old is Barty ? 
He can not come ! 
Percy said solemnly : 
Oh , I'm sure Crouch will be up and coming soon enough . 
But at this moment , I am willing to shoulder him . 
Of course not every party attended . 
Percy laughed vaguely , saying , 
Yes , no , I had to deal with all sorts of work that was going on in his absence - Did you hear about Ali Bashir who had just been arrested for smuggling goods that were flying from outside into the water ? 
And then we have to try to persuade the Transylvanians to sign an international double penal code . 
I also have to meet with their Chief of Technical Cooperation in the coming year 
Ron shuddered to Harry : 
We go away , away from this percy snob 
Harry and Ron pretended to get more water , they scrambled off the table , walked around the dance floor , and rushed out of the lobby . 
The front door is still open and the fairy lights in the garden still flash , sparkling , Ron and Harry go down the steps of the castle and find they just fall into the bushes , the way The crooked winds are magnificently decorated , and the majestic stone statues . 
Harry heard the spray , as if there was a fountain in the garden . 
Scattered here , students sitting on the carved bench . 
Harry and Ron started walking along one of the narrow paths through the bushes of roses , but they were only a short distance away when they heard a familiar , unfamiliar voice : 
There is nothing to trouble me , Mr. Igor . 
Karkaroff's voice sounded anxious and trying to hold back , as if deliberately not letting anyone hear the ear : 
Brother Severnus , you can not pretend like this does not happen . 
It has become increasingly clear over the last few months . 
I'm really worried , I can not deny that 
Master Snape's voice : 
Then run away . 
Run away - I ' ll make excuses for you . 
But I stayed at Hogwarts . 
Snape and Karkaroff walked around the corner of the garden . 
Snape was holding up a wand to pick up the bushes , his face irritated . 
A little girl ran across the teacher , he said : 
Game Fawcett ! 
Except the Ravenclaw ten points ! 
A little boy ran after the girl who had just come in , too : Snape shouted : 
and deduct ten Hufflepuff houses for Stebbins ! 
At that moment Harry saw Ron and Ron walking down the path in front of him , he asked : 
What are you two doing ? 
Harry saw Karkaroff look a little embarrassed to see them standing there . 
He reached for a bearded claw , and he began to twirl his beard around his finger . 
Ron said , 
We go for a walk . 
So there is no rules ? 
Snape snarled . 
Then continue walking ! 
He brushed them off , stepped over them , his black long sleeve over his waist . 
Mr. Karkaroff hurriedly followed Snape . 
Harry and Ron continue down the road . 
Ron murmured : 
What makes Karkaroff so worried ? 
Harry also slowly questioned : 
And ever since that two of them became friends you me ? 
Now they have come to a rugged rock reindeer , splashing water splashing over the statue into a towering fountain . 
They saw two giant balls sitting on the stone bench watching the water spray under the moonlight . 
And then Harry heard the sound of Hagrid's voice , his voice unusually hot : 
The moment I see you , you know 
Harry and Ron flinched . 
I do not know why but they feel it does not belong to the kind of thing they do not like Harry looked around , back down the aisle and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing near the rose bushes . 
He patted Ron on the shoulder and nodded to the other two , implying they could sneak away by the side of the road without being noticed . ( Harry thinks that Fleur and Davies are so busy not to notice them . ) But Ron , seeing Fleur as his eyes wide open with fear , shook his head , and it pulled Harry back into the area . shade of reindeer , hide in it . 
Said Maxime , 
What do you know , Hagrid ? 
Harry definitely did not want to hear this conversation . 
He knew that old Hagrid would hate to hear it in such a situation . ( If that's the case , he would hate it too . ) If it could be , it would fill his ear and make a loud noise , but it would not . It is a must to do . 
Instead , Harry tried to concentrate on a beetle crawling along the rock reindeer's back . 
But the beetle was not attractive enough to draw Harry's mind so that he would not hear from Hagrid's next words : 
You know I'm the same as you at my father's or your mother's ? 
I do not understand what you say , Hagrid 
Hagrid said quietly , 
You're on your cheek . 
She was one of the last of the breed in England . 
Of course you do not remember her very well . You know , she left when he was three . 
You're not really a kind of mother - in - law Ờ that's not in their nature , right ? 
Not knowing what happened to her he only knew she might have died 
Mrs. Maxime did not say anything . 
And Harry , in spite of his original kindness , stopped staring at the scabbard and looked up at the horns of the reindeer , listening to him before . Harry had never heard of Hagrid talking about his childhood . . 
His father broke heart when his mother left . 
His father is a small family . 
When he was six , he was able to lift his father , putting him on top of the cabinet if he made him angry . 
He often laughed and laughed 
Hagrid's quiet voice suddenly broke . 
Mrs. Maxime listened , motionless , gazing at the silver - spotted fountains . 
Ba raised him big but then three died , of course , only after he started school . 
From then on he lied alone to himself . 
Dumbledore helped him a lot . 
Very kind to him , he 
Hagrid pulled out a mottled silk handkerchief and shook his nose . 
That's enough for him anyway . 
What about you ? 
Are you the third or the third ? 
But Mrs. Maxime stood up suddenly . 
She said : 
It's cold . 
But no matter what the weather was like , it was as cold as her voice : 
I think I have to go . 
Hagrid went blank : 
Huh ? no , do not go ! 
He had never met anyone else before . 
Mrs. Maxime's voice was still cold as ice : 
What else could it be ? 
If only Harry could tell Hagrid it was best not to answer ; but he stood there , hidden in the darkness , grinding his teeth , hopelessly hoping that Hagrid would not say but did not do anything . 
Said Hagrid . 
Of course , a huge hybrid ! 
Mrs. Maxime shrieked . 
How dare you say that ! 
Mrs. Maxime's voice exploded in a quiet night like a siren ; Harry heard behind it Fleur and Davies broke out of the rose bush . 
I have never been offended in my life ! 
Hybrid people ? 
Is she ? I only have big bones ! 
She discharged , each of the colorful fairies flying into the air when she was angry at the bushes of trees passing by them . 
Hagrid was still sitting on the bench , staring at Maxime . 
It was too dark to see Hagrid's face . 
Then , a minute or so later , he got up and walked away , not returning to the castle , but through the schoolyard toward his hut . 
Said Harry , very quietly , with Ron : 
Well , let's go 
But Ron did not budge . 
Harry looked surprised Ron : 
What's up ? 
Ron looked back at Harry , whose expression was serious : 
Do you know ? 
About Hagrid is that giant hybrid ? 
Harry shrugged . 
Are not . 
So what ? 
Based on the look that Ron had thrown at him , Harry knew that once again it revealed his ignorance of the witch world . 
Harry was raised by the Dursleys , so there was not much that the Sorcerers paid attention to Harry properly . 
But in recent years it has become less and less surprising . 
But now it can be said that most witches will no one go silly ' Then why ' when discovered that one of his friends is the daughter of a giant . 
Said Ron , 
In the castle I will explain , go ! 
Fleur and Davies have disappeared , perhaps in a more secluded grove . 
Harry and Ron returned to the hall . 
Parvati and Padma are now sitting at a remote table with a bunch of Beauxbatons boys , and Hermione is dancing with Krum . 
Harry and Ron sat down on the side of a table that had been moved away from the dance floor . 
Harry asked Ron , 
Star ? 
What is the giant ? 
Ron struggles to say : 
Well , they are not very good . 
Ron used reluctantly . 
Harry said : 
Who said ? 
What's wrong with Hagrid ? 
Ron shook his head . 
I know there is nothing , but Mihh , cowardly he kept secret . 
I thought he was buried in the spell when he was big or why he was too general , but not shy . 
He does not like to talk about it 
Harry said : 
But what if his mother was a giant ? 
Ron said slowly : 
For anyone who knows him does not mind , because they know he is not dangerous . But Harry , these giants , they are evil . 
As Uncle Hagrid says , it's about their nature , they're like giant monsters , like killing . Everyone knows that . 
However , there are now no more giants in England . 
What happened to them ? 
Well , it was because they were dying , and the parts were killed by the Malay Shamans . 
But there are also some giants abroad who mostly hide in the mountains 
Harry watched Maxime sit alone at the judge's table , looking very sad . 
It says : 
I do not know what Mrs. Maxime thinks she's fooled . 
If Hagrid was a giant hybrid , she would be the same . 
Big bones only have dinosaurs that have bigger bones than her . 
For the rest of the night of the dance , Harry or Ron sat in the corner of the hall talking about the giants , no one to dance anymore . 
Harry tried not to look at Cho and Cerdic too much , just to see that they were upset about wanting to kick something . 
When the band Destiny Stopped Playing in the middle of the night , everyone gave them a loud applause last and then swarmed to the lobby . 
Many expressed their wish that the night of the feast could be extended , but Harry was completely happy to go to the bedroom . 
According to the feeling of it , the night dance is not very happy . 
Outside the lobby , Harry and Ron see Hermione farewell to Krum before he returns to the Durmstrang . 
She looked coldly at Ron , and walked quickly across Ron's face , without a word , walking up the marble stairs . 
Harry and Ron followed Hermione , but halfway up the stairs , Harry heard the call : 
Hey , Harry ! 
It's Cerdic Diggory . 
Harry could see Cho standing in front of Cerdic in the lobby below the stairs . 
Cerdic ran up the stairs to meet Harry , but Harry asked coldly , 
What ? 
Cerdic does not seem to want to talk to Ron . 
Ron shrugged , seemingly falling , and continued climbing up the stairs . 
When Ron was gone , Cerdic lowered his voice : 
I owe you one time when you told me about the dragon . 
Do you know anything about that golden egg ? 
Does it cry when you open it ? 
Harry said : 
Have . 
Go bath 
What ? 
take a shower and take the egg and reheat everything in hot water . 
It will help you think . 
Harry glared at Cerdic . 
Cerdic says : 
Let me tell you , using the boss's baths , the fourth door from the left of Boris Ng's wall on the fifth floor . 
The password is ' Fresh as a pine ' . 
I have to go here I want you to sleep well 
He grinned at Harry and rushed back down the stairs to meet Cho . 
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower alone . 
That advice sounds really bizarre . 
Why bath can help it find the meaning of the golden eggs touched is crying it ? 
Cerdic opened the egg of the picture then ? 
Does Cerdic intend to play Harry to make it look like a fool ? Let Cho compare that prefer him more ? 
Mrs. Beo and her friend Violet were snoring in the picture of the hole . 
Harry screamed : Fairy Light ! They wake up . 
And when they wake up they are extremely angry . 
Harry climbed over the portrait hole , seeing Hermione and Ron fighting . 
Two children stood three meters apart , screaming at each other , every face is also purple . 
Cried Hermione : 
Oh , if you do not like it then you have to know what the solution is ? 
Her hair is now down from the elegant bun , and her face wrinkled with anger . 
Shouted Ron : 
What solution ? 
The next time there is a ball , please invite me before someone else do that , do not scare the market and then salvage me ! 
Hermione turned on the stairs leading to the girl's bedroom , and Ron stood gasping for a second , just as the goldfish was thrown out of the water . 
She turned to see Harry . 
It looks like it was struck by lightning , stuttered three : 
That proved completely derailed 
Harry did not say anything . 
He still likes Ron on the side so he does not want to talk right now - but in truth he sees Hermione more than Ron . 
CHAPTER 24 RITA SKETCH 
On Christmas Eve , everyone gets up late . 
Gryffindor's quarters are much quieter than they were a few days ago . 
Sloppy conversations were interrupted by yawning jaws . 
Hermione's hair was ruffled ; She confessed to Harry that she had applied a comfortable amount of shampoo to her hair on the night of the ball . 
But that way is too complicated , can not do every day . 
Hermione looked at the simple fact , just scratching her ear as Crookshanks crooned . 
Ron and Hermione seem to have reached a tacit agreement not to mention the previous argument . 
They have been acting friendly again , though somewhat flamboyant . 
Harry and Ron did not wait long to tell Hermione the story they had heard between Hagrid and Maxime . 
But Hermione is not as shocked as Ron about the news that Hagrid is a giant hybrid . 
She shrugged : 
Oh , I thought he must be a giant hybrid , I know he can not be a pure giant , because pure giant is six meters high . 
But to be honest , these are just big hysterics . Not all giants are horrible . Just a kind of prejudice like the prejudice people have had against wolves . Just blinded up , right ? 
Ron's voice was as if he just wanted to choke , but maybe he did not want to wake up to another fight . 
When Hermione did not look at him , he shook his head in a way he could not believe . 
Now it's time to think about the piles of work that they have molded during the first week of vacation . 
At this point , when Christmas is over , people feel a bit bored - oh , everyone , except for Harry , is starting to feel a bit tense ( again ) . 
Its suffering is that after the Christmas calendar is over , the day of the fourteenth month turns out to be near , but it has not done anything to answer the suggestion hidden inside . gold egg . 
So , it started to get eggs and listen intently , hope this time will understand something . 
He was anxious to see what the horrible sound reminded him of , in addition to seeing only the sound of the ghosts of the thirty saws . 
But it never heard such strange sounds . 
He closed the egg again , shook the egg harshly , and then opened it again to see if the sound had changed , but it still sounded . 
He also tried to ask some questions with the egg , trying to scream out loud , but nothing happened . 
It was also a time of frenzy , throwing the egg across the room - though it did not really matter what the effect was . 
Harry did not forget the suggestion that Cerdic had instructed him , but the sense of being too hostile to Cerdic made Harry not interested in following Cerdic's advice at all if he could find another . . 
If Harry felt Cerdic seemed to really want to help him with one hand , then it would be much more definitive . 
Harry , who had told Cerdic exactly what was going to happen in the first round - Cerdic considered suggesting to Harry to take a bath as a fair exchange . 
Oh , anyway , it does not care about that kind of nonsense - especially one's hand holding Cho's hand that goes up and down in the corridor . 
So when the first day of the new semester came , Harry started going to class , not only carrying books , with parchment , writing goose feathers as usual , but also wearing heavy in the heart of the anxious private . about the golden egg . 
The snow was still thick on the school grounds , and the windows of the cage had been soaked in water , so thick that they could see nothing at the time of the study . 
The weather is so unpredictable , so even if , as Ron says , the monsters may warm up the students comfortably by chasing them , or The tail was so strong that Hagrid's hut burned fire . 
But when they reached Hagrid's hut they met in front of the hut an old witch , short - haired short - haired , and the chin was too loose . 
She screamed at the students in the snow toward her . 
Hurry , the bell rings in five minutes . 
Ron eyed her . 
Who are you ? 
Where is Hagrid ? 
She answered quickly : 
I am Professor Grubbly - Planhk . 
I am the incumbent teacher of Mysterious Creature Care . 
Harry repeated the question , his voice louder : 
Where is Hagrid ? 
Professor Grubbly - Plank replied : 
He is sick . 
A small , uncomfortable laugh came from Harry's ear . 
It's back : Draco Malfoy and the other Slytherins are pulling to the classroom . 
All of them seemed happy , and none of them seemed surprised to see Professor Grubbly - Planhk . 
Professor Grubbly - Planhk said : 
This way please . 
She strode across the pasture , where the beauxbatons ' big horses were shaking . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione followed her , still looking at Hagrid's hut . 
All windows are closed . 
Is Hagrid in there , sick and lonely ? 
Harry hurried up to catch up to Professor Grubbly - Planhk , it asked : 
What was Hagrid doing ? 
Professor Grubbly - Planhk responds as if she thinks Harry is a whore : 
Do not worry anymore . 
Harry said impatiently : 
You are very concerned . 
What's wrong with him ? 
Professor Grubbly - Planhk acted as if she had not listened to Harry . 
She led the class through the pasture . 
The beauxbatons ' horses are standing there , clutching each other in the cold . 
She led the students to go to the edge of the forest , where a white code was stamped with a neck stump . 
Many daughters uttered an oOo when you see the code . 
Lavender Brown whispered : 
Oh , it's so beautiful ! 
How did the teacher get a baby ? 
It is hard to catch them . 
The white bird was so brilliant , that the snow around it turned out to be a gray color . 
He was jerking his golden hooves to the ground and kicking the horns at the top of his head . 
Professor Grubbly - Planhk swings his arms out , grabs Harry's chest and yells : 
Get out , some guys ! 
White code only for girls to touch only . 
The girls , step ahead , approached it carefully , go , easy 
Professor Grubbly - Planhk and the girls slowly step towards the coyote , leaving the boys standing by the grazing fence , watching . 
When Professor Grubbly - Planhk went out of earshot , Harry said to Ron : 
What do you think is wrong with Hagrid ? 
Do you think a monster ? 
Malfoy chen said quietly : 
Oh , he was not attacked , Potter , if you're worried too much . 
No , he was too scared to dread the ugly face of his ugly . 
Harry interrupted Malfoy : 
What did you say ? 
Malfoy put one hand in his robes , pulling out a sheet of newspaper . 
It says : 
Here you go . 
I do not like to tell you bad news , Potter 
Malfoy laughed horrifiedly when Harry picked up the newspaper , opened it and read it , while Ron , Dean , Seamus and Neville read it over his shoulder . 
The article is accompanied by a portrait of old Hagrid looks extremely cunning . 
THE DUMBLEDORE's DARKNESS 
Rita Skeeter , Special Reporter for the Journal , Albus Dumbledore , the eccentric principal of the Hogwarts School of Magic and Magic , is not afraid of a controversial nomination . 
But in September of this year , he hired Alastor Moody - a - crazy , a former well - known illusionist , to teach Anti - Artistic Defense ; An appointment made many in the Ministry to raise an eyebrow , because Moody's famous bad habit was to attack anyone who had sudden movements in his presence . 
Moody Eyes , however , seems to be responsible and kind when compared to the hybrid - whom Dumbledore has hired to teach Mysterious Life Care . 
Rubeus Hagrid , who confessed to having been expelled from Hogwarts School when he was in his third year , had enjoyed the jail at school since then , a job Dumbledore had bailed him . 
However , last year , Hagrid used his spellbinding influence on the principal to get another job as a masters of Esoteric Nursing , overcoming candidates with merit . Much more valuable . 
Hagrid was a frighteningly large and frighteningly powerful man who used his new powers to scare the students with the care of a series of horrific creatures . As Dumbledore ignored it , Hagrid had made many students injured during a series of lessons that the students considered very fearful . 
A fourth - year student , Draco Malfoy , said : " I was struck by a code attack , and my friend , Vincent Crabbe , was bitten by a spit . 
All of us hate Hagrid , but we are afraid , do not dare to say anything . 
However , Hagrid did not intend to stop his terrorist campaign . 
In a conversation with the Prophet of the Prophet last month , he did not expect to breed the creatures he dubbed the " Tailed Shrike " , a cross between the mantis and the crabs . same danger . 
The breeding of new organisms , of course , is an activity often monitored closely by the Ministry of Mines and Control . 
Hagrid , however , himself surpasses that mundane control . 
Before the subject changed , he said : 
I'm just kidding . 
As if that was not enough . 
The Prophet's New Prophet now makes clear that Hagrid is not a purebred witch as he pretends to be . 
Actually , he is not a pureblood . 
His mother , we can disclose privately , is none other than the giant Fridwulfa , who ran to the present still remains . 
Bloody and brutal , the giants have come to the point of extinction by the wars between them together in the last century . 
A handful of people are still present in the K - staff who are known to be responsible for the mass murders of the Muggle under his reign . 
While many giants serving under the Who - Who - Who - Who - Know - It were destroyed by the Gods against the Dark Side , then Fridwulfa was destroyed . 
Maybe she escaped , came to live in a huge community still living in a mountain range overseas . 
However , if there is any lesson from Hagrid's madness in the Mystic Cultivator classes , that was : the son of Fridwulfa apparently inherited the cruel nature of mom . 
A bizarre trick , Hagrid is known for developing a close friendship with him that has made his Who - Who - Know - Who power collapse , and It also caused Hagrid's biological mother and other supporters of Who - who - knows - who - to find a place to hide . 
Maybe Harry Potter knows nothing about this unfortunate truth about his giant friend . 
But Albus Dumbledore is certainly obliged to make sure that Harry Potter and his peers are aware of the dangers of dealing with a giant hybrid . 
Harry finished reading the article , looking up at Ron , saw Ron mouth open mouth . 
He whispered : 
How did you know ? 
But that was not something Harry had bothered about . 
Harry turned to Malfoy's face : 
What do you mean we all hate Hagrid ? 
What is the joke about her uncle ? 
Harry pointed at Crabbe , continued : 
What is Nhu - bite bite , Bon Nhu - also has no teeth anymore ! 
Crabbe laughed hysterically , evidently very complacent . 
Malfoy's eyes flashed : 
Well , I think this will end the foolishness of that old man . 
The giant hybrids I thought he'd just swallowed a bottle of Moffat at an early age . No parents liked this . They would have scared him to eat their children , haha . 
You 
The game over there pay attention ? 
Professor Grubbly's voice - Planhk echoed the boys standing . The girls were clambering around the coyote , caressing it . 
Harry was so angry at the article that the Daily Prophet in his hand trembled as he glared at the coyote without seeing anything . 
Professor Grubbly - Planhk is listing the magic features of the alpha male in a loud voice so that the boys can also hear clearly . 
When the lesson is over , the students go to the castle for lunch . 
Parvati Patil said : 
I hope the teacher will continue to teach . 
She teaches many things better than what she envisioned in the Care of the Living Creatures . The Mystics have truly decent creatures such as whims , not just monsters 
Harry said as they walked up the steps of the stone : 
What about Hagrid ? 
Parvati stiffened his voice : 
Hey ? 
Do you keep the locker ? 
Since the night of the dance , Parvati has become cold with Harry . 
Harry thought maybe it should show a little more concern to her , but then she was happy too ! 
Parvati must have told everyone that she had arranged to meet the Beauxbatons student at Hogsmeade on a weekend trip . 
As they entered the hall , Hermione said , 
Today's lesson is good . 
I do not know half the things that Professor GrubblyPlanhk lectures on the white 
Harry proffered the Prophecy Daily before Hermione's nose , harsh : 
read this ! 
Hermione's mouth opened as she read the article . 
Hermione's reaction is exactly the same as Ron's reaction . 
How could that terrible Skeeter know ? 
How could Hagrid tell her ? 
Harry led the group to the Gryffindor table , throwing himself down on a chair , angry at the branch : 
No way . 
He did not even tell us ! 
I guess she was crazy because she refused to tell her horrible things , so she stalked around here to get revenge on her . 
Hermione quietly said : 
Perhaps she had heard Hagrid talk to Mrs. Maxime on the night of the dance . 
Said Ron : 
If so , we must see her in the garden ! Anyway , she was not going to school , Hagrid said Dumbledore had blocked the door . 
Harry took the stewed chicken from his dish and made the flesh slammed around in anger : 
You can also have an Invisibility Cloak . 
Hiding in the bushes stalking people are the things that she likes very much , right ? 
Hermione said : 
Did you say it's like you and Ron do that ? 
Ron was very upset : 
We did not deliberately listen to him ! 
At that time , we had no other choice ! 
That silly Hagrid talked about his giant cheeks where everyone could hear him ! 
Harry said : 
We must visit him again . 
This afternoon , after the study of the Prophet . 
Tell him that we want him to teach you also want him to teach again , right ? 
Harry asked Hermione . 
At the look of Harry's anger , Hermione said , 
Oh , I do not want to pretend that changing the teacher who teaches Mysterious Life Care is not a good place , but of course I want to teach Hagrid again , yes ! 
So that afternoon , the three of them left the castle again and walked through the snow - covered schoolyard to Hagrid's cottage . 
They knocked on the door , Fang barked and barked . 
Harry shook hands by the door , shouting : 
Hagrid , we're here ! 
Open the door ! 
Hagrid did not answer . 
They heard Fang locks the door , moaning , but could not open it . 
They opened the door for ten more minutes , Ron even went round to punch one of the windows , but also no answer . 
They finally gave up and went back to the castle . 
Hermione said : 
What does he avoid us ? 
Surely he knows we do not care about him being a giant hybrid . 
But it seemed that Hagrid was concerned . 
For a whole week , they did not see where he was . 
At lunch , he did not appear at the teacher's table in the hall . 
They did not see him patrolling the school grounds , and Professor Grubbly - Planhk continued to teach Mysterious Life Care . 
Malfoy is thrilled to have every chance to play Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Any place where the teacher's presence ( to ensure safety before Harry's retaliation ) was that it was rattling Harry's ears : 
Remember your big brother ? 
Miss man - elephant very hả ? 
In mid - January there is a hiking trip to the village of Hogsmeade . 
Hermione was amazed that Harry was eager to get ready . 
She said : 
Do you think you need to enlist at the quiet common room to embark on answer the puzzle in the egg ? 
Harry lied : 
Well , I thought I had a pretty clear idea of ​​ that egg now . 
That impressed Hermione , she said : 
Really ? 
So good ! 
Harry felt a guilty feeling in his heart , but he ignored it . 
It still has five weeks to solve that egg , and after all , it's still long . Meanwhile , if he's going to Hogwarts Village , he ' ll be able to meet Hagrid , maybe he can persuade him back . . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione left the castle on Saturday , crossing the cold wet field , toward the school gate . 
When they crossed the Durmstrang boat across the lake , they saw Viktor Krum appear on the deck , barely wearing nothing but a swimsuit . 
Strangely , he looked slightly bony , but obviously cooler , because he climbed into the boat , stretched out his arms , and darted down the lake . 
Harry rubbed his eyes with Krum's undulating head emerging in the middle of the lake . 
It says : 
Is he crazy 
Are you cool ? in January ! 
Hermione said : 
He is much colder in his hometown . 
Surely he is much warmer here . 
Ron did not seem to mind - maybe he was hoping : 
Oh , there's a giant squid under the lake ! 
Hermione recognized Ron's implication in his voice , and she frowned . 
Hermione said : 
You know , he's really nice . 
The picture does not look like anything you think of people coming from Durmstrang . 
She told me that the picture she liked was much better here . 
Ron did not say anything . 
From the dance to the present he did not even mention Viktor Krum for an hour , but Harry found it under his bed the next morning the night of a tiny arm , which looked as though it had been severed from a broken Character statue wearing a Hungarian Quidditch team . 
Throughout the road down Mt . Snow , Harry carefully looked for a sign of Hagrid . 
He suggested that they go to the Three Trees Shop once it was determined that Hagrid was not in any of the stores . 
The pub was as crowded as ever , but with only an overturned look , Harry saw that Hagrid was not there . 
With a downward spasm , she accompanied Ron and Hermione into the bar , bought three bottles of Rosemera's butter beer , and thought it was worth staying at Hogwarts Castle for the crying egg ! 
Suddenly Hermione whispered : 
Did not he ever go to the office ? 
Look ! 
Hermione was in the glass behind the bar , and Harry saw the reflection of Ludo Bagman sitting in a dark corner with a group of goblins . 
Mr. Bagman was talking to the goblins in a very fast and small voice . 
All the goblins are sitting cross - legged , your face seems a little summer . 
Harry thought , really , that Bagman was here , in the Three Trees , on a weekend , when no triangular events took place , and no matter what . references . 
Harry watches Bagman in the mirror . 
He seemed nervous , very nervous , just like that night in the forest , before the Dark Sign appeared . 
But just then Bagman turned around and saw Harry , he stood up . 
Harry heard Bagman say to the goblins in a sly voice : 
Wait a minute ! 
Wait a moment ! 
Mr. Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry , his face smiling again . 
He said : 
Harry ! 
How are you Looking forward to seeing you again ! 
Everything is good ? 
Harry said : 
Yes , well , thank you . 
Mr. Bagman eagerly said : 
Do not know if I can say a few words to you , Harry ? 
You can give us a few minutes , okay ? 
Oh , okay 
Ron and Hermione walked to the table and sat . 
Mr. Bagman led Harry along the wine bar to the far corner of Mrs. Rosemera . 
He said : 
Well , I just thought I had to congratulate you once again on Harry , on your spectacular performance against the Forest Tail . 
Strike is super good ! 
Harry said : 
Thank you . 
He knew this was not what Bagman wanted to say to him , because he could totally congratulate it on Ron and Hermione . 
But Bagman did not rush to reveal it . 
Harry noticed he glanced at the counter at the counter , watching the goblins , all of whom were watching Bagman and Harry in silence through their dark and slender eyes . 
Mr. Bagman noticed that Harry was also watching the goblins , he said in a small voice to Harry : 
It's a nightmare ! 
Their English is not quite as good as it was to recreate the story with the Hungarians in the World Cup but anyway , at least they know the sign language that another human being can recognize . 
This flood is to babble the words that period 
I only know there is a language only . 
Bladvak . 
It means a pickaxe . 
I do not like to use it in case they think I'm scaring them . 
He suddenly burst out laughing . 
Harry noticed that the goblins were watching him closely . 
She asked : 
What do they want ? 
Mr. Bagman suddenly worried : 
Ờ Wah ! 
They are looking for Mr. Barty Crouch . 
Harry asked : 
Why are they looking for Mr. Crouch here ? 
He is working at the Ministry of Magic in London . 
Mr. Bagman said : 
Well , I do not know where he is . 
He is not supposed to go to work anymore . 
Absent from the office for about two weeks now . 
Young Percy , his assistant , said he was ill . 
Obviously , the total only sends orders to the office by the owl . 
But do not tell anyone this , Harry . 
Because Miss Rita Skeeter is still hunting anywhere she nods . 
And I bet she would embroider Crouch's disease into something ominous . 
He was said to be missing Bertha Jorkins . 
Harry asked : 
Do you have any information about Bertha Jorkins ? 
Mr. Bagman said tensely : 
Are not . Of course I'm for the searcher ( Harry thinks it's time to go ) , and everything is strange . 
She was certainly in Albania , because she met her second cousin . 
And then she left the relative's home to go south to visit an aunt and then she seemed to disappear without leaving a trace on the way . 
Let me explode if I can know where she goes She's not the type to do things like the secret wrapped up by the boys but , what are we talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins for ? so what ? 
I really want to ask you 
Mr. Bagman lowered his voice : 
How do you do with the egg dragon ? 
Harry said it was not very honest : 
Not bad . 
Mr. Bagman seemed to know Harry was not telling the truth . 
He said ( still small voice ) : 
Listen , Harry , I feel this is very soon you are thrown into this competition , do not you do not volunteer and if ( his voice is now small to hear , Harry must lean forward to listen ) If I could help a hint in the right direction I started to like you the way you overcame the dragon ! You only need to speak for a minute . 
Harry looked roundly at the round face and the large , blue eyes of Bagman . 
He said , trying to keep his voice normal so as not to be accusing the Minister of Sports and Recreation of breaking the law . 
But let us have to answer the clue alone , right ? 
Oh right , right 
Mr. Bagman impatiently , 
But Harry , we all want Hogwarts to win , right ? 
Harry asked : 
Have you offered to help Cerdic yet ? 
A very slight frown made Mr. Bagman's flat face slightly wrinkled . 
He said : 
Are not . 
I , like I said , I stabbed you . 
Just want to help 
Harry said : 
Yes , thank you , but I think I'm close to achieving a few more days to settle it . 
Harry did not understand why he denied Bagman's help , except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him , getting some help from him , somehow cheating . Asked Ron , Hermione or Sirius . 
Mr. Bagman was almost humiliated , but he could not say much more because Fred and George appeared right at the time . 
Fred smiled brightly : 
Hello Mr. Bagman ! 
Can we invite you a glass of wine ? 
Mr. Bagman glanced at Harry one last disappointment , saying : 
Well , do not thank you guys ! 
Fred and George were as disappointed as Bagman . 
He was still exploring Harry as if it had disappointed him so much . 
He said : 
Well , I have to run away . 
It was good to meet you all . 
Good luck , Harry ! 
Mr. Bagman rushed out of the restaurant . 
Summer elves fled from the seat and also from the bar to follow him . 
Harry arrives with Ron and Hermione . 
Just as Harry sat down , Ron asked , 
What do you want ? 
Harry said : 
He suggested to help me in the golden egg . 
Hermione was shocked : 
He can not do that ! 
He is a jury member . 
But you have found a solution anyway ? 
Harry said : 
Ờ almost so . 
Hermione still looks deeply indignant : 
Well , I think Dumbledore would not like it if he knew Bagman was trying to encourage you to cheat ! 
I hope he is also looking for help Cerdic so . 
Harry said : 
No , he did not help Cerdic . 
I asked . 
Said Ron : 
Who is not worried about Diggory help ? 
Harry implicitly agrees . 
Hermione took a sip of butter , saying : 
Do not the goblins look so friendly ? 
What are they doing here ? 
Harry said : 
They were looking for Mr. Crouch , Mr. Bagman said . 
Mr. Crouch was sick and did not go to work . 
Said Ron : 
Percy was poisoned by him . 
It could have been imagined if Mr Crouch had died , the picture would have been promoted to the Ministry of International Co - operation . 
Hermione looked at Ron with a non - play - like look . 
She said : 
Grieving , goblins go looking for Mr. Crouch Normally , goblins work with the Ministry of Mystery and Control . 
Harry said : 
Mr. Crouch spoke in many languages , perhaps as a translator . 
Ron asked Hermione , 
Now you care about the wretched goblins ? 
Does the calculus set the Liberation Front of Elves or something else ? 
The Ugly Guardian of Protection ? 
Hermione laughed sarcastically . 
Ha ha ha elves do not need protection . 
Do not you remember Binns who taught us about the goblin revolts ? 
Ron and Harry both said , 
Are not . 
Hermione took another sip of avocado : 
You say , goblins are quite capable of dealing with magicians , unlike elves . 
The goblins are very clever , but the elves are never self - area . 
Wipe rub 
Shouted Ron , looking out the door . 
Rita Skeeter has just entered the pub . 
Today she wore a long yellow banana peal , her long nails painted a horror pink . 
And she went with one of her belly - photographers . 
Rita bought the drink , and with the photographer's hand passed the crowd in the pub , to a table near them . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione scowled at her as she approached . 
She is saying purple , very satisfied about something . 
Did not seem interested in talking to us , Bozo ? 
Hey , why do you think so ? What was he doing with such a bunch of goblins ? 
Show them the most ridiculous scenes he is always a liar no matter what . guess what's going to happen ? 
Think we should dig a little more ? To watch ' The Disappointed Former Head of the Department of Sports and Recreation , Ludo Bagman hears a sensational headline from a fascinating article , Bozo . We need to find a story that suits the That's it 
Harry says loudly : 
How to ruin the life of another ? 
Some people looked around . Skeeter's eyes flickered behind her jewelery as she recognized the man . 
She grinned : 
Harry ! 
Really is cute ! 
Why do not you come here with me ? 
Harry angrily said : 
I would not approach her without a three - meter broom . 
What did you do to Hagrid ? 
Rita raised her eyebrows : 
Our readers have a right to know the truth , Harry . 
I simply do my job 
Harry shouted : 
Who cares about him is the giant hybrid ? 
What does he have ? 
The pub suddenly became silent . 
Rosemera stared at the customers from behind the bar , and forgot about the fact that the jar of alcohol in her hand was filled with warm honey wine . 
Rita's smile was a little blurry , but then she recovered it in the blink of an eye . 
She opened the crocodile leather handbags , pulled out a stylized goose , and said , 
So you let me make an interview with you about Hagrid you know , Harry ? 
How is the person behind the giant ? 
And your unreal friendship and the underlying reasons in it . 
Will you call him a replacement father ? 
Hermione stood up suddenly , the buttermilk grasped in her hand as if it were a grenade . 
She whispered through her teeth : 
That lady of the king , she made up stories regardless of all right , she does not matter what people ? 
Even to Ludo Bagman 
Sit down , she's silly , do not say things that I do not know anything . 
Rita's voice was cold , her gaze ruthless looking at Hermione . 
I know about Ludo Bagman doing her hair 
Rita looked at Hermione's haircut , adding : 
It does not even need to cross . 
Harry said : 
Come on , Hermione ! 
Let's go , Ron ! 
They left ; Many people stare at them as they pass by . 
When they reached the door , Harry glanced back . 
Rita's autobiographer was confused , running back and forth on a piece of parchment paper on the table . 
They hurried out into the street , Ron said in a whispered whisper , 
Hermione , the next time she will chip down for the button . 
Said Hermione , 
Try it ! 
Her body was trembling with anger : 
I ' ll let her know ! 
I'm a stupid child ? 
She will pay the price for that . 
At first , Harry , then to Hagrid 
Ron said , 
Do not upset Rita Skeeter . 
I'm serious , Hermione . 
She ' ll pick you up for scandals 
Our mothers did not read the Prophet's Daily . 
She will not make her afraid to escape ! 
She was now walking so long and so fast that Harry and Ron could do nothing more than to duck to follow her up . 
The last time Harry and Ron saw Hermione in an angry state was like this when Hermione slapped Malfoy with a blow . 
She continued walking and said , 
And Hagrid did not need to be avoided ! 
He should not allow anyone to take advantage of that excuse and hurt him ! 
Come on ! 
She began to run , leading them back up the path to the school gate with statues of wild boar wings standing on both sides , then ran across the school grounds to the hut of old Hagrid . 
The window was still closed , and as they approached , Fang barked fiercely . 
Hermione gripped the door , shouting : 
Uncle Hagrid ! Enough , Hagrid ! 
We know you are in it ! 
Nobody cares about your mother . 
Uncle Hagrid , do not let that evil Skeeter do so ! 
Uncle Hagrid , I'm out of here , I just need you 
The door opened . 
Hermione was saying : 
About ! 
The girl immediately shut her mouth , as she realized she was not facing Hagrid , but with Dumbledore . 
He was smiling down at the young man , saying softly : 
Hello children ! 
Said Hermione , her voice slightly smaller : 
We wish to see Hagrid . 
Dumbledore's eyes flashed like stars : 
Oh , you guessed it . 
Why do not you walk in ? 
Hermione said : 
Oh yes ! 
Harry , Ron and Hermione walked into the hut . 
Fang dash into Harry the minute he entered the hut . 
The dog barked like mad and tried to lick Harry's ear . 
Harry thrusts Fang out and looks around . 
Hagrid was sitting at the table , with two large cups of tea on the table . 
His eyes were swollen and his face was swollen ; his eyelids were swollen , and he had come to the point where he was speaking , when his hair was crumpled . 
Instead of making the hair fair , they now look like a tangle of wigs with tangled wire . 
Harry said : 
Hello Hagrid ! 
Hagrid looked up . 
He said hoarsely . 
Ờ 
Dumbledore had closed the door behind Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
He said : 
Add tea home ? 
Grabbing his wand , one lighted , a spinning tea tray appeared in mid - air along with a plate of pastries . 
Dumbledore allowed the tea tray to land on the table . 
And everybody sat down . 
Quiet for a moment . 
Then Dumbledore said : 
Have you heard something Granger screams , Mr. Hagrid ? 
Hermione was embarrassed , her cheeks blushed . 
But Dumbledore smiled at her and continued : 
Based on the way that Harry , Ron and Hermione tried to break the door , they seemed to want to hear about you , Hagrid . 
Harry stared at Hagrid , saying , 
Of course we still want to know more about you ! 
Do not think of anything that Skeeter Cow , please excuse me . 
Harry glanced at Dumbledore . 
Dumbledore turned two fingers around each other , eyes staring at the ceiling . 
He said : 
You are temporarily deaf and have no idea what you are saying , Harry . 
Harry said sheepishly : 
That's right . 
I was about to say , Hagrid , how could you think we were concerned about what the lady was writing about you ? 
Two huge tears in Hagrid's dark eyes and slowly rolled down the tangled beard around his chin . 
Dumbledore looked up at the ceiling carefully . 
He said : 
This is living proof of what I said to you , Hagrid . 
I showed him the letters of countless parents , who still remember him from the time they were students at this school , they said with certainty that if I were to chase him , they would definitely have react to that 
Said Hagrid in a husky voice : 
Not all people do not all want me to stay here 
Dumbledore now stared hard at his half - moon glasses : 
Yes , Hagrid , if you are concerned about the cosmic fame , you must have shrunk in this niche for so long . 
From the day that I started being the principal of this school , not one week I did not receive a complaint about the way I run the school . 
But what should I do ? 
Did I lock myself in my office and not talk to anyone ? 
Said Hagrid , 
But they do not have a giant . 
Harry said , 
Hagrid , what do you think of your relatives ? 
You think of the Dursley family ? 
Professor Dumbledore said : 
An excellent point ! 
My brother , Aberforth , was accused of throwing a talisman for a goat . 
That story was published um xrom , but that my brother did not want to hide ? 
It's a long time ago to escape . 
Photos of the high head that do the work of the photo as usual . 
Of course , I'm not entirely sure that the photo is readable , so maybe it's not that bad . 
Hermione quietly said : 
Come back and teach us to go to Hagrid ! 
Repeat this , we miss you very much . 
Hagrid gasped , his tears rolling over his cheekbone that permeated his old beard . 
Dumbledore stood up . 
He said : 
I refused your resignation , Mr. Hagrid , and I expect you to work again on Monday . 
At eight o ' clock in the morning of Monday morning , come to breakfast with me in the hall . 
No reason to refuse . 
Welcome to everyone . 
Dumbledore left the hut , pausing just a moment to scratch Fang's ear . 
When he closed the door behind him , Hagrid began to face his hands like a ragged junk that sobbed . 
Hermione patted his arm , and finally , Hagrid looked up , his eyes glowering bloody . 
He said , 
A great man Dumbledore ... a great man 
Said Ron : 
Yes , yes . 
Did you eat some more bread ? Hagrid ? 
Hagrid wiped his tears with the back of his hand : 
Oh , just eat the baby , yeah you're right , you're right , my daddy must be so embarrassed by the way he behaved 
The big tears burst out , but he strongly brushed off , and said , 
Uncle never showed my children the picture of three doctors right ? here 
Hagrid stood up to the drawer , opened a compartment , and took out a picture of a small wizard with black eyes glittering like Hagrid's . 
That sorcerer sat on Hagrid's shoulder , smiling . 
Based on the apple tree behind them , Hagrid was two meters tall or two yards away , but his face and chin had no beard , looking youthful , smooth and round . . 
With that expression Hagrid was certainly less than eleven years old . 
Said Hagrid , 
This picture was taken before he entered Hogwarts . 
Your father died that he was worried that he would not learn to be a magician , because his uncle Ừ , anyway it is not that he is good at magic , but anyway . Your father must also see the scene of expulsion . 
You understand , he died when he was in his sophomore year 
Dumbledore was the man who raised up after his father's death . 
Then let him do the tool holder know the use of people , always give them the opportunity to re - make life that makes different from other principals , you understand ? 
Anyone who enters Hogwarts , as long as the person is talented . 
You know that one can become a good person no matter what their profile is how respectable it . 
But some people do not understand that . 
There are some people who always have that against him . There are people pretending they have only big bones but do not dare to stand up and say , ' I am myself , and I am not ashamed of myself . . ' My dad taught me ' Do not be ashamed of yourself . 
There will be people on your resume against you , but they are not worth your attention . 
And he was right . The damage was stupid . 
But I do not care about her anymore , I promise you the same . 
Big bones will give her big bones ! 
Harry , Ron and Hermione looked at each other anxiously . 
Harry would rather have taken fifty Tailed Shrike races than to admit it had overheard Hagrid's affair with Maxime ; But Hagrid kept on practicing , obviously not aware that he was talking grotesquely . 
He raised his eyes from the picture of the three old men , eyes bright : 
Do you know anything , Harry ? 
When I first met you , I reminded you of my condition . 
My cheeks are gone , and I feel like I can not study at Hogwarts , remember ? 
Dare not be sure that you will get over so that now look at you see Harry , Hogwarts Academy ! 
He looked up at Harry for a moment and said , very formal : 
Do you know what you want , Harry ? 
Uncle wants me to win the competition , I really want to . It will prove to them that there is no need to be pure . 
You do not need to be embarrassed about your resume . 
Your victory will prove to everyone that Dumbledore is the one with the right perspective : whoever has magical abilities can do magic . 
What did you do with that golden egg , Harry ? 
Harry said : 
Very good ! 
Really is good . 
Hagrid's grimace flashed with a grin : 
My son's face ! ... 
Show them , Harry , open your eyes . Defeat all of them . 
Lie to Hagrid is not like lying to anyone else . 
Harry went back to the castle with Ron and Hermione that afternoon , unable to dispel the happy flash of Hagrid's face as he imagined Harry winning the Magic Trial . . 
The hard - to - understand golden eggs weighed heavily on her conscience that afternoon . 
And it's time to go to sleep , it's decided : it's time to get rid of the narcissism , but try to see what the Cerdic suggestion is worth ? 
CHAPTER 25 THE EGGS AND THE EYES 
Because Harry does not know how long it takes for the bath to unravel the mystery of the golden egg , it decides to take a bath at night , which is when it can take a lot of time . 
Though reluctant to accept Cerdic's grace , he decided to use the chambers of the chaplains , since very few people were allowed to use the bathroom , so it was less likely to be disturbed . 
Harry planned it carefully , because it had been caught by a supervisor Filch at the time when he was hiding and wandering outside the restricted area at midnight , and he did not want to repeat the experience . that . 
Of course , the Invisibility Cloak is extremely necessary , and to be extra careful , Harry thought he would bring with him the Map of the Chil - the most helpful item for breaking the school rules . Invisibility Cloak , which Harry obtained . 
The map depicts the entire Hogwarts corner , including crossroads and secret passages , and more importantly , it shows people inside the castle in the form of dots are attached when they move in corridors ; So Harry could be warned if anyone approached the bathroom . 
On Thursday night , Harry quietly went to bed pretending to sleep , wearing the Invisibility Cloak , and down the stairs , ( and did the same way he did the night Hagrid helped him discover the cubs . dragon ) , waiting for the port to open . 
This time , the person waiting outside to read the password ( ' fried banana ' ) for Mrs. Béo was Ron . 
When Harry came out Ron climbed in , he said small : Good luck home ! 
Tonight , Harry had hugged the golden egg in one arm , the other with the map drawn up in front of his nose , so he walked awkwardly under the Invisibility Cloak . 
However , the corridors covered by the moonlight are completely empty and quiet , and by examining the map at every turn of the strategy , Harry can be assured that it will not be confronted by anyone . it does not want to see . 
Upon arriving at the statue of Boris Ng , a mage who looks genuinely weary with his gloves , Harry finds the door on the right . 
He leaned against it and whispered the password Cerdic had given him : Fresh as a pine 
The creaked door opened . 
Harry locked in , locked the door behind him , took off his Invisibility Cloak , looked around . 
The instant feeling of it is that it is worth striving to be the boss to get used to this bathroom . 
In the chamber lit by glittering candles , everything was made of white marble , including something that looked like an empty rectangular swimming pool sinking deep in the middle of the room . 
There are about a hundred gold taps mounted around the edge of the lake , each with a colorful jewel in the handle to twist the cock . 
There is a board to dive . 
Long curtains of linen hang over the windows ; In one corner of the bathroom was a heap of white foam soft towels , and a gold framed picture hanging on the wall . 
In the painting a gorgeous blonde sailor was sleeping on a rock , her golden hair covered her face slightly wavy waves when the world snores . 
Harry walked over , looking around , his feet echoing from the walls . 
Although the bathroom was extremely magnificent - although it was very eager to turn the gold faucets - but now it still can not suppress the feeling Cerdic may have been playing it . 
How could this place be assumed to be the secret answer to the egg dragon ? 
Anyway , he also took a towel , placed the Invisibility Cloak , the map , and the egg next to the bath of the size of that pool , kneeled down and turned on some tap . . 
Harry could see right away that the nozzles flowed into the various bubbles mixed with water , though that was not the usual soap that Harry used . 
One of the faucets releases large pink and green balloons with a leather ball . 
Another faucet flushed white foam like ice so thick that Harry thought the foam was enough to support his body floating on the foam , if he wanted to try . 
A third tentacles sprayed with passionate purple clouds hovering over the water . 
Harry entertained for a moment by knocking off the nozzle and turning off the other . It especially enjoyed the effect of a tap that echoes out of the face to form large arcs . 
Then , when the deep pool was filled with hot water , foam , bubbles ; Considering the size of the lake in a split second , Harry twisted all the faucets , took off his pajamas , dropped his slippers , and slipped into the water . 
The lake was so deep that it was hard to reach the bottom of the lake , and it swam along the length of the lake and back to the head of the lake , then stood in the water , staring at the egg . 
Even though it is very exciting to swim in the foam - filled , floating water surrounding it , Harry does not see the wisdom of it flourishing for innovation , nor does it feel any more at all . . 
Harry stretched out his arms , lifted the egg with his wet hands , and opened it , the cry of moaning , the whimper swarming over the shower , echoing among the white marble walls , but also It is as difficult to understand as before , if not to be more difficult to understand because the mixing of the negative expectation . 
Harry hastened the egg right away , for fear of the horrible sound that would invite the curator Filch to come , and wondered if this was Cerdic's conspiracy . 
At that moment , someone said , making Harry jump up to drop the egg , causing it to roll across the bathroom floor . 
If I were a game then I would put eggs in water . 
Harry had swallowed a few sips of soap in a panic . 
He stood up , sprayed the water , and saw the ghost of a very mournful girl sitting cross - legged on one of the faucets . It was the crying Ma Myrtle , who was crying crying on the toilet in the toilet three steps down the ladder . 
Harry said angrily : 
Myrtle ! 
I was not busy at all ! 
The foam was so thick that it did not really matter , but Harry had an uncomfortable feeling that Myrtle had stalked him from one of those tapes since he'd been in the bathroom for so long . 
But the ghost winked behind the glasses , saying : 
When you got to the lake , I closed my eyes . 
It's been a long time since you've seen me again . 
Harry slightly lowered his legs , only to be absolutely certain that Myrtle could see nothing but his head floating on the water . 
It says : 
I was not allowed to go to your bathroom , right ? 
Her daughter's bath . 
Myrtle laments : 
At that time he did not have the verse in that way he kept peeing in it throughout . 
It was true , though , that Harry , Ron , and Hermione had noticed that Myrtle's spoiled toilet was the most convenient place to be in the secret of the multi - drug poisoning - a forbidden poison that we It used to transform Harry and Ron into two live copies of Crabbe and Goyle in an hour , so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room . 
Harry said : 
I was forbidden to go to that place . 
I think it's best not to come back again . 
Harry said that it was half true , because Percy once caught it poking his head out of the girls ' bathroom and rebuking for a fight . 
Myrtle groaned a handful of acne on his chin : 
Oh well , I ' ll try that egg underwater anyway . 
Cerdic Diggory did that . 
Harry exclaimed : 
Are you stalking him too ? 
What do you do ? 
Are you in the dark every night to sneak in the shower ? 
Myrtle slightly shy : 
Sometimes , but I never talk to anyone . 
Harry cunningly : 
That is my pleasure ! 
Please shut your eyes ! 
When it was clear that Myrtle had glazed his eyes , he swung up from the pool , wrapped his scarf around his waist , and ran back to retrieve the egg . 
When Harry jumped back into the water , Myrtle looked over his fingers and said , 
Do it ! Then open it under the water 
Harry dropped the egg under the foam and opened it this time , the egg did not cry anymore . 
A loud voice came from the egg , and it was difficult to distinguish every word of the song . 
Myrtle seems to be very pleased to be the boss to do this to Harry , do that : 
You need to hit your head in the water always . 
Do it ! 
Harry took a deep breath and stuck it under the water - and then , sitting at the bottom of the lake made of marble from the bubbly lake , Harry heard the strange singing voice coming from the egg open in his hand : 
Find us where we hear our voice 
We can not sing on the ground 
And when you search , consider this : 
We take away what you will miss 
A long hour you will have to find 
And recover what we have taken 
But if more than an hour - the prospect will be dark 
Too late , it will lose , it will not come back . 
Harry emerged on the water with bubbles and foam , shaking his head to curl his eyes . 
Myrtle asked : 
Are you listening ? 
' Find us where we can hear our voices and if need be , I need to listen again 
Harry dives underwater . 
Three times heard listening to the song of the egg under water , Harry's new recitation . 
He was standing in the water for a while , thinking deeply , while Myrtle was sitting there watching him . 
He slowly said : 
I have to go find someone who can not use my voice on the ground Ờ Who can be the one ? 
Why are you so stupid ? 
Previously , Harry had never seen Myrtle so cheerful , not to mention the day when Hermione took a puff of herbal medicine and a furry face , and a cat's tail . 
Harry looked around the bathroom thinking that if that voice could only be heard in the water , it must be of aquatic life . 
He said this to Myrtle , Ma cried with a laugh : 
Well , Diggory thinks so too . 
He was lying under the water talking to himself about it all the time , time and time again so long that all the bubbles are gone . 
Harry slowly said : 
In the water of Myrtle , what is in the water of the lake , besides the giant squid ? 
Myrtle said : 
Oh , all kinds of things . Sometimes I am thrown into it sometimes can not be any other , if there is someone to discharge the toilet when I suddenly 
Trying not to imagine the scene of the crying Ma Myrtle drifted down the drain to the lake with the content in the toilet , Harry said : 
Oh , what is there to live under the lake of human voice ? 
Well , drill 
Harry's eyes suddenly see the American painting on the wall . 
Myrtle , in the lake there are fishermen ? 
Autos are good . 
Myrtle said , his thick glasses flickered : 
Diggory takes more time to figure it out ! 
It is while she is awake . 
Myrtle nodded toward the mermaid with an inestimable expression on his mournful face : 
laugh and boast some fish scales 
Harry asked nervously : 
Is it , right ? 
The second test is to find a fisherman in the lake and 
But Harry suddenly understood what he was saying , and he felt the urge to run dry in him , as if someone had just gotten rid of his stomach : he was not a good swimmer . 
Harry had no chance to practice swimming . 
Dursley learned to swim , but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would have hoped that someday Harry would drown , so he never bothered to teach him to swim . 
So wading a few rounds of this bath , it did not do much , but the lake at the castle is much broader and deeper and the mermaid is sure to live somewhere on the bottom of the lake . 
Harry asked slowly : 
Myrtle , how can I breathe ? 
Upon hearing this , Myrtle's eyes suddenly burst into tears . 
He pockets his purse took out a handkerchief wipe the tears , sobbing : 
scandalous ! 
Harry looked puzzled : 
What's life 
Myrtle screamed , and the cry of the ghost screamed in the shower : 
Speaking of breathing in front of me ! 
When I can not when I'm not so long 
Myrtle buried his face in his handkerchief and blasted his nose . 
Harry remembered this crying ghost very easily heartbreaking whenever he talked about death , but no ghost that Harry ever met again made that so fussy up so . 
Harry said impatiently : 
Sorry , I did not mean I just forgot 
Myrtle glanced at him with his eyes swollen , sobbing : 
Oh yes , it was easy to forget Myrtle's death . 
When I was alive , no one remembers me . 
How many hours did they take to find my body ? I know , I'm sitting there waiting for them . 
Little Olive Hornby , in the bathroom , asked , ' Are you sitting here sulking again , Myrtle ? 
Professor Dippet told me to go find you ' And then he saw my body Oi , to death it can not forget , I assure so that I keep following him all the time , make him remember forever . 
I remember his brother's wedding 
But Harry did not hear Ma cry again . 
He was pondering the mermaid's song . 
We take away what you will miss . 
It sounds as though they are about to steal something , which it must take back . 
What will they take away ? 
and then of course the little girl went to the Ministry of Magic to guide me , not letting me cling to it . 
So I have to come back here and live in my toilet . 
Harry said indifferently . 
Good . 
Oh , I have a lot to do You can close your eyes again ? 
I'm about to get out of the bath . 
He collects the eggs under the bottom of the lake and climbs out of the lake , drying himself , wearing underwear and pajamas . 
When Harry hurried to take on the Invisibility Cloak , the ghost croaked . Myrtle asked gloomily , 
Do you sometimes visit me in my toilet ? 
Ờ free , I will visit 
Harry whispered , as long as all the bridges in the castle were clogged , then he would have to go back to Myrtle's bowels . 
Goodbye to my sister Thank you for helping me 
Myrtle said gloomily : 
Goodbye ! 
When Harry wore the Invisibility Cloak , he saw Myrtle jumping back to the tap . 
Out to the dark corridor , Harry opened the map of the hackers to check the situation around there quiet . 
Well , two dots named Supervisor Filch and Teacher's Cat , Mrs Noris , are in the supervisory office . Nothing is moving except for the super - stirring Peeves , though it just jumps back and forth . in the traditional upper floor room . 
Harry stepped back to Gryffindor Tower and something on the map suddenly caught his eye on something very monstrous . 
Peeves are not the only dots on the move . 
A solitary dot was gently flying across a room in the left corner of the basement - Professor Snape's office . 
But the dot is not named Severus Snape . 
It's called Bartemius Crouch . 
Harry stared at the dot . 
Mr. Crouch was so sick that he could not go to work and did not go to the Christmas ball . 
Then what are you doing here when you sneak into school 
Hogwarts at one o ' clock in the morning ? 
Harry watched the dot move around the room , stopping there and stopping there 
Harry hesitated hesitantly , thinking it and then curiosity prevailed in him . 
Turn back , do not go to Gryffindor Tower , but in the opposite direction , go to the nearest staircase , it wants to see what Mr. Crouch did . 
Harry went down the stairs , though the faces in the portraits hung curiously as he heard the creaking floorboards and the rattles of his sleepy pants . 
Walk along the corridor by the side , past the embroidered carpet on the wall in the middle of the aisle , then head straight down the narrow staircase , which is the shortcut that leads straight down to the two storeys . 
It still glimpses the map , wondering why , Mr. Crouch's exemplary , decent , law - abiding man sneaked around in someone else's office late in the night , not fitting at all . His way out . 
And then suddenly , halfway down the stairs , at the very moment when he did not think about what he was doing , nor focused on anything but Crouch's odd behavior , his legs stumbled right . The stairs that Neville had always forgotten to avoid , Harry staggered , and the golden egg , still slippery after bathing , slipped off Harry's hand . 
He leaned forward to try and catch again , but it was too late . 
The egg falls down the stairs and rolls long , causing a boom when it comes down a ladder , sounding like a drum beat . 
The Invisible Jacket slipped away , Harry grasped the map , took off his hand , dropped down the six steps , and Harry , stuck up the stairs to his knees , could not Come to pick up the map . 
The golden egg rolled to the end of the embroidered rug of the stairs , bursting out , and began to mourn in the corridor below . 
Harry pulled out his wand , trying to reach the map of the robber , to whitewash it , but the map was far away , it could not reach . 
Covering the Invisibility Cloak , Harry straightened up , listened intently with scared eyes , and almost immediately 
PEEVES ! 
There is no mistaking where the chase shout of Filch . 
Harry could hear the rush of the supervisor coming closer and closer , and his whistling sound grew louder . 
What's the big deal ? 
Wanna wake up the castle ? 
I ' ll catch you , Peeves , I ' ll catch you , what will you be ? 
Filch's footsteps stopped . 
There was a clang of metal on the metal , and the cry was crying . 
Filch picked up the egg and closed it . 
Harry listened silently , one leg still stuck in the magic ladder . 
Right now , Filch is going to pick up the embroidered carpet , thinking he ' ll catch the Peeves no matter where the Peeves are . But if he goes up the stairs he will see the map of the robbers and Harry Potter is wearing the Invisibility Cloak , the map also clearly shows the name of Harry Potter right where it is standing . 
At the bottom of the stairs , Filch said quietly : 
Gold egg ? 
Chu dear , this is the clue of Magic Trial Competition that ! 
This is a military school ! 
Mrs. Noris apparently followed Filch's foot . 
Harry panicked , his heart beating fast want to break the chest . 
Brother Filch roared joyfully : 
PEEVES ! 
Are you stealing ? 
The carpet was embroidered and Harry could see the filthy face of Mr. Filch and his pale , pale eyes gazing up at the empty staircase ( for him ) . 
Filch said softly : 
You hide ? 
I ' ll come to see you , Peeves Mi dare to steal a clue to the Magic Trial , Peeves Dumbledore will kick you out of here , my dear pet the dirt 
Filch began climbing up the stairs , the cat asserting the dusty color of his master clinging to his feet . 
Noris's rounded golden eye , like his master's eye , glared at Harry . 
Harry had previously wondered if the cat's eyes could see through the invisible Cloak of Fear . Harry watched Filch in his old pajamas approaching closer and closer . 
He tried desperately to find his way out of the magic ladder , but only to make it sink a few more inches . 
Only seconds later , Filch would see the map and go straight to it 
Mr. Filch ? 
What happened ? 
Filch stopped beneath Harry , a few steps away , and turned around . At the foot of the stairs a man could only make Harry's situation worse : Snape . 
He was wearing a long and damp nightgown . 
Filch whispered maliciously : 
Professor Snape , it is the love super - stirring Peeves . 
He threw this egg down the stairs . 
Snape hurried up the stairs and stopped behind Filch . 
Harry gritted his teeth , believing his pounding heart would accuse him in a matter of seconds . 
Snape looked at the egg in Filch's hand , 
Peeves ? 
But Peeves could not be in my office . 
This egg is in the professor's office , professor ? 
Snape Snitch : 
Of course not . 
I hear it crying and crying 
Yes , Professor , that's the egg I came out to investigate 
It was Peeves who threw it , sir 
And as I passed by my office , I saw the torch lit and the door opened ! 
Someone just ransacked the room 
But Peeves can not 
Snape snapped again . 
I know it can not be it , Mr. Filch ! 
I was spoiling my office with a charm that only the magician can solve ! 
Snape looked up at the top of the stairs , looked directly at Harry , then looked down the corridor below the stairs . 
Filch , I want you to come with me , help me search for the intruder . 
Yes , Professor 
Filch looked up at the top of the stairs , exactly where Harry was standing . 
Harry could see that he was reluctant to give up a golden chance to catch Peeves . 
Harry asked gently : go away , go with Snape ! Mrs. Noris was curling up at Filch's feet , looking at him with a faint sense that the cat could sniff it , that it was too stupid , filling the bathtub with spongy foam . more trouble like this . 
Filch said : 
Professor , this is how the principal will listen to me . 
Peeves stole a student , this is my chance to get rid of this superlative love out of school , once and for all . 
Mr. Filch , I do not care about that miserable baby , right in my office 
Submitting 
Snape stopped talking suddenly . 
Both Snape and Filch look down at the foot of the stairs . 
Through the gap between the two men , Harry saw Professor Moody Eyes - mad limping to go . 
Mr. Moody is wearing an old travel hoodie outside his nightgown and sticks as always . 
He just raised the stairs and grumbled : 
Open the party - sleep ? 
Filch said : 
Professor Moody , Professor Snape and I hear the noise , baby love stir fry Peeves again as messed up as ever , and then Professor Snape discovered the intruder of the professor's office 
Snape snapped . 
Shut up ! 
Brother Moody stepped closer to the foot of the stairs . 
Harry saw his magician's eyes flicker over to Snape , and then to himself , could not be mistaken . 
Harry's heart fills . 
Brother Moody could see through the mantle of Moody alone , seeing this strange scene : Snape was wearing his nightgown , Filch was holding the egg , and Harry was trapped in the stairs . Behind the two teachers . 
The wound down the edge of Master Moody surprised . 
For a few moments , Harry and Moody stared at each other . 
Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eyes towards Snape . 
Moody says : 
Can I hear you , Mr. Snape ? 
Someone broke into your office ? 
Mr. Snape replied coldly : 
No big deal . 
Brother Moody : 
On the contrary , it is very important . 
Who dared to break into your office ? 
Snape said , 
I bet you are a student . 
Harry could see Snape's sweat bulging against his sweaty temples . 
It used to be . 
The poisonous materials stored in my cabinet are usually stolen and sure students are trying to make illegal drugs . 
Mr. Moody says : 
Do you think the intruder is just taking medicine ? 
Is not there anything that is being hid in your office ? 
Harry noticed Snape's haggard face turned dark red in an odd way , the blood vessels in his temples were beating rapidly . 
Mr. Snape spoke in a small and dangerous voice : 
Brother Moody , you know I do not hide anything , as you have ransacked my office quite carefully . 
Moody's face twisted into a smile : 
Snape , that's the privilege for the god of light . 
Dumbledore told me to watch 
Mr. Snape said through his clenched teeth : 
Dumbledore trusted me . 
I do not believe he ordered you to search my office ! 
Brother Moody growled : 
Of course Dumbledore trusted him . 
You are a good believer , are not you ? 
Trust in the healing . 
But I .. I say there are crooks who have not revealed the hidden face never revealed , do you understand what I want to say ? 
Suddenly Snape made a very strange move . 
His right hand gripped his left arm violently , as if something had hurt him . 
Moody laughs : 
Well , go to sleep , Snape ! 
Snape threw his hands out as if angry with himself , he hissed : 
You have no right to send me here or there . 
I also have the power to sneak in the night like you in this castle ! 
Mr. Moody said briefly , but his voice was threatening : 
Then go snooping . 
I hope to see you hanging out somewhere in the dark corridor By the way , he drops something . 
Harry's horror struck a fatal blow when Moody pointed at the map of the hijackers who was still sprawled at Harry's feet six steps apart . 
When both Snape and Filch looked at each other , Harry raised his hand in disbelief , raised his hand under the Invisibility Cloak , and waved his hands to Moody's attention , his mouth saying in unkind words : 
Of children ! 
That's mine ! 
Snape went over to pick up the parchment , a terrible look on his face as he realized what it was . 
Accio Parchment ! ( That is , rolls of parchment come here ! ) 
The map soared into the air , surpassing Snape's long fingers , and descended down the stairs to leave Moody's hand . 
Mr. Moody said calmly : 
I'm wrong . 
This is mine . 
I must have dropped it before . 
But Snape's eyes were black from Filch's hand to the map in Moody's hand , and Harry could tell that Snape was matching the two , and that Snape was alone . 
Potter . 
Snape said quietly . 
Mr. Moody casually folded the map back into his pocket . 
What is up ? 
Snape snarled . 
Potter ! 
He turned his head and glared back to where Harry was standing , as if he suddenly saw Harry . 
That egg is Potter's . 
That parchment also belonged to Potter . 
I've seen it before , I recognize it ! 
Potter is here ! 
Potter , in its Invisible Cloak sheet ! 
Mr. Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and started walking up the stairs ; Harry dared vow that his huge nose was open wide to try to sniff Harry . 
Trapped on the stairs , Harry flipped his back to try to avoid Snape's fingers , but only a little 
Brother Moody says : 
There is nothing here , Snape ! 
Anyway , I ' ll tell Dumbledore how sensitive his mind is to Harry Potter . 
Snape's arms still extended , his long fingers only a few inches to touch Harry's chest . 
But he paused , looking back at Moody : 
What do you mean ? 
That means Dumbledore is keen to know who is trying to kill him ! 
Mr. Moody limped closer to the foot of the stairs . 
And me too , Snape , you are very interested 
The torch lit up Moody's scars , scarring , and nose had lost its darker and deeper depths . 
Snape looked down at Moody , and Harry could not see his expression . 
For a moment no one moved or uttered a word . 
Mr. Snape slowly lowered his hand . 
In a tone of voice that sounded calm , Snape said , 
I just thought that if Potter wandered the night it was a bad habit of it should not do so again . 
Because of its own safety . 
Moody said gently : 
Oh , I see . 
The bottom of my heart is very interested in Potter , right ? 
Stop for a moment . 
Snape and Moody still glared at each other . 
Mrs. Noris still hung at Filch's feet and stared , suddenly calling out a loud Meo , who was looking for the scent of soaps on Harry's face . 
Snape said curtly : 
I go to sleep . 
Mr. Moody says : 
That was his best thought all night . 
Well , Filch , if you give me that egg 
Filch hugged the egg as if it were his newborn son : 
Are not ! 
Professor Moody , this is evidence of Peeves deception 
Mr. Moody says : 
That is the possession of a champion that it has stolen . Take this , immediately ! 
Snape went down the stairs , passing Mr. Moody without saying an extra word . 
Brother Filch spoke loudly to Noris and turned away , and the cat stared at Harry for a few seconds before walking to his master . 
Harry heard Snape's footsteps away from the end of the corridor , his breath still folded . 
After giving the egg to Teacher Moody , Filch went out of sight , only listening to the murmuring voice of Mrs. Noris : 
It's okay to meet Dumbledore tomorrow morning with the Peeves 
A closed door closed . 
Harry was still standing in the middle of the stairs , looking down at Moody . 
He placed his staff at the foot of the stairs and began climbing up stairs to approach Harry hardly , patiently , his steps on a staircase sounding a croaking . 
He kept quiet with Harry : 
It's almost me , Harry ! 
Harry replied weakly , 
Thank you thank you . 
Mr. Moody took the map out of his pocket , opened it and asked , 
What is this ? 
Yes , the Hogwarts campus map . 
Harry said , wishing that Moody would soon free him from the ebb tide ; Its legs started to hurt . 
But Moody looked at the map , his magical eye began to puzzled . 
Thay whispered : 
God , here's the map , Harry ? 
Yes , it must be very useful teacher ! 
Harry said with tears in his leg . 
Can you help me ? 
what ? 
Well , of course ! 
Brother Moody took Harry's arm and pulled him up . 
Harry's feet escaped the stairs and he stepped up the stairs to stand . 
Mr. Moody was still looking at the map . 
He slowly said : 
Potter you happen to see someone broke into Snape's office ? What you say is seen on this map . 
Harry confesses : 
Yes , I see it is Mr. Crouch . 
Moody's magical eye is scanning the surface of the map . 
He looks suddenly worried : 
Mr. Crouch ? 
Are you sure , Harry ? 
Harry said : 
Definitely . 
Moody's eyeball continues to scan the map : 
Well , he is not here anymore . 
Mr. Crouch is very interesting 
He did not say anything further for a minute , still looking at the map . 
Harry could say that Mr. Crouch's entry into Snape's office was meaningful to Moody , and he wanted to know what was going on . 
He does not know if he should ask . 
Moody slightly scared him , though he did a great deal to help it avoid a lot of trouble 
Moody teacher , why do you want to search Mr. Snape's office ? 
Moody's magical eye was removed from the map and tied to Harry's face , a little shaky . It was a penetrating insight , and Harry was impressed that Moody was estimating Harry's maturity , to see if he should answer it , and to tell him how large . 
Finally Moody says : 
Think about it , Potter , people say Crazy eyes - crazy obsessed with the black witch hunting , but compared to Mr. Crouch , he is nothing , nothing . 
He continued to stare at the map . 
Harry is anxious to know more about fire . 
He asked again : 
Moody teacher , do you think this is related to maybe Mr. Crouch thinks something is going on ? 
Mr. Moody interrupted : 
Like what ? 
Harry did not know what to say . 
It does not want Moody's guess that it has an information source outside of Hogwarts ; That could lead to questions about Sirius . 
Harry whispered : 
I do not know . 
Recently there are so many strange things going on , are not you ? 
Stories in the Daily Prophet The Dark Sign appears in the World Cup , and Death Eater , with everything . 
Both Moody's divergent eyes are wide open . 
Then the magical eye moved around the map . 
He slowly said : 
You are a sharp teenager , Potter . 
Mr. Crouch may well be thinking in that direction . 
Possibly , lately there have been rumors of humor being released , of course , due to the influx of Rita Skeeter . 
He thought that was what made many people nervous . 
A grim smile twisted his distorted twisted mouth . 
He murmured , seeming to speak to himself more than to Harry , while his magician's eye stared at the left corner of the map : 
Oh , if there is one thing that I hate , it is the Death Eaters outlaws themselves self - publishing 
Harry looked up at Moody . 
Or is Moody's the only thing he thinks ? 
Suddenly Moody turned to work : 
Now you want to ask me something , Harry Potter . 
Harry's heart sank ; He thought this was going to happen . 
Surely Moody's going to ask him where he got this map , a very suspicious magical item - and the whole story of how the map fell into Harry's hands ; That story not only blamed it , but it involved his father , Fred , and George , and last year's anti - art professor Lupine . 
Harry suffered while Moody phoned the map in front of him : 
Can you borrow this ? 
Ồ 
Harry had a great map of it , but on the other hand , it felt extremely relieved when Moody did not ask anything about the origin of the map . 
And , of course , he was grateful to Moody , who said , 
Yes , yes . 
Brother Moody : 
Good game ! 
You can use this for a lot of things . This is probably exactly what you're looking for . Come on , let's go sleep , Potter , come on ! 
Two teachers together climb up the stairs , Professor Moody continues to scrutinize the map as if it was a treasure that he had never seen before . 
They walked quietly together until they reached the door of his office . 
He stood looking at Harry : 
Have you ever thought about the Spirit of Light , pt : 
Have you ever thought about the Spirit of Light , Potter ? 
Harry was startled : 
No . 
Moody nodded and looked at Harry thoughtfully : 
You need to think about this . 
Oh yeah , and by the way , I guess you brought that egg with you not to go out for a walk tonight ? 
Harry laughed : 
No , I found the clue . 
Moody winked at Harry , his magical eyes spinning again : 
There is nothing like walking in the night to find an initiative , Potter and see you tomorrow morning 
Mr. Moody went into the office , looked at the map again , and closed the door behind him . 
Harry went leisurely to Gryffindor Tower , immersed in the thought of Snape , Mr. Crouch , and the meaning of all that happened . Why did Crouch pretend to be sick , once he managed to get into Hogwarts ? whenever he wants ? 
What do you think Snape is hiding in his office ? 
And Mr. Moody thinks it , Harry , should become a goddess ! Ten minutes later , as Harry quietly climbed up onto the four - poster bed , the egg and the Invisibility Cloak were safely in the chest , for some reason , Harry thought . It wants to check how bright the other gods are , before it decides to make a career . 
Chapter 26 THE SECOND TEST 
Hermione said , 
But you said you found the clue in that egg . 
Harry harshly : 
Please speak small ! 
I need to hit the big hit is not it ! 
Harry , Ron and Hermione were sitting in a separate table at the end of the Spell class . 
Today they were given a practice exercise called Triệu tập - In order to avoid potentially fatal accidents in the flying objects throughout the classroom , Professor Flitwick gave each student a pillow to practice , based on the theory that the pillows would not do . Anyone who gets hurt if they miss the target . That's a nice theory , but it's not really good at all . 
Neville's goal was always miserable , and he unwittingly dumped much heavier objects , such as Professor Flitwick , for example , being pushed through the room . 
As Professor Flitwick flew reluctantly past Harry , Ron and Hermione , and landed on a large head , Harry hissed in Hermione's ear : 
Can you forget the egg for a minute ? 
I'm going to tell you about Snape and Moody 
This class is the ideal place to discuss privately , because everyone is so excited to get rid of flying objects so no matter what , Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Harry shuddered and recalled his adventures the night before during the last half hour of the session . 
Ron scooped up his wand , letting go of a pillow with the pleasure of making his eyes light up , ( the pillow soaring into the air and dropping Parvati's hat ) Ron said : 
Mr. Snape said that Mr. Moody also ransacked his office ? 
Did you think Moody was here to watch Snape and Karkaroff ? 
I do not know if it's Dumbledore's assignment to Moody's , but he's definitely doing the job . 
Not paying much attention to practicing the spell , Harry waved the wand , making his pillow perform only a glimpse of the table . 
Harry continued : 
Moody says Dumbledore's reason for leaving Snape to stay in school is because he's giving him a second chance or something . 
what ? 
Ron's eyes widened as his next pillow swung in mid - air , fluttering at the lights , bouncing and falling heavily on Professor Flitwick's desk . 
Said Ron : 
Harry Moody teacher said that Snape gave you that cup of fire ! 
Hermione shook her head suspiciously : 
Oh , Ron , we used to think that Snape wanted to kill Harry , but it turned out that he was trying to save Harry , remember ? 
She pulled out a pillow that made it fly across the room and fell , right in the box that was supposed to be the landing zone of all the pillows . 
Harry looked at Hermione , thinking it was Snape who had saved his life once , but the bizarre thing was that Snape was definitely hating it , as he had hated his father during their time as a student . at Hogwarts School . 
Snape's teacher liked Harry's point , and certainly did not miss the opportunity to punish him , even offering to expel Harry . 
Hermione continued to say : 
I do not mind what Moody says , Dumbledore is not stupid . 
He was very good at trusting Hagrid and Lupine , though a whole bunch of people had no job assigning them . 
Then how did Dumbledore make a mistake in using Snape's master , though Snape was a bit of a snob 
evil ! 
Ron immediately : 
Think , Hermione . 
Then why did all the Dark Wizard hunters search Snape's office ? 
Hermione did not pay attention to Ron , continued to speculate : 
Why did Crouch pretend to be sick ? 
This is ridiculous , is not it ? 
He could not arrange to go to the dance that he wanted when he could come here at midnight . 
Ron pushed aside another pillow to the window , saying : 
You do not like Mr. Crouch because of Winky . 
Hermione pushed her pillow down to the bottom of the box . 
And you just want to think that Master Snape must have something to do . 
I would like to know what Mr. Snape did with his first chance , if he is currently offered a second chance . 
Harry groaned , and his pillow flew straight across the room and neatly landed just above Hermione's pillow , causing Harry to be amazed . 
Yes , Sirius told me to tell you something unusual happened at Hogwarts . 
Harry sent the note that night with his school brown owl , telling everything from Mr. Crouch's break in Snape's office to an argument between Snape and Moody . 
Then Harry redirected his attention to the most pressing issue he was facing : how to survive in the water for an hour on the next four - and - a - half days . 
Ron enjoyed the idea of ​​ using the Summoning Spell . 
Because Harry had explained to him about the Muggle diving suit , Ron did not understand why Harry had not summoned a suit from the nearest Muggle shop . 
Hermione immediately dismissed this plan by pointing out that , in the event that Harry could not manage to learn to use a diving suit within the specified hour , it would certainly be excluded from the competition because of It's very unlikely that a Muggle would see a swim suit flying across the countryside to go to Hogwarts . 
She said : 
Of course , the ideal solution for you is to transform into a submarine or something similar . 
If only we had studied human transformation ! 
But that subject to the sixth year we get them , and if the school does not arrive to the place to be crushed into the ghost is really terrible . 
Harry said : 
Oh , I do not like to walk around with the lens out of the top of my head . 
If you have Moody in front of you , make sure you can always attack someone ; he can help himself 
Hermione said earnestly : 
But I do not think you will let you choose what you want to turn into . 
No , I think it's best for you to use a spell . 
Harry thought he was about to read the book in his library for the rest of his life , burying his head in a dusty book , searching for a spell that would make a human being able to live in the water . no oxygen required . 
But , though , Ron and Hermione studied during lunch breaks , evenings and weekends ; Although Harry had asked Professor McGonagall a special permit to consult the book in the Restricted Area , and even with the help of the lurid vampire librarian Mrs. Pince , They still did not find out what could have helped Harry after an hour in the water but survived for three injections . 
The horrible shock is now beginning to make Harry miserable and it is very difficult to focus on the lessons . 
The lake that once upon a time was so unique to the school grounds that it attracted its attention every time it approached the classroom window . 
The cold gray water with the cold dark water was beginning to look as distant as the moon . 
Just like before , when it had to deal with the tail dragon - Gai , the time suddenly passed by as if someone had twisted the clock for it to run super fast . 
There is only one more week left until the fourteenth day of February ( there is still time ) There are only five days left ( it must be resolved immediately ) Three days left . I figured out how to go ) 
With only two days remaining , Harry began to swallow his food . The only good thing in Monday's breakfast was the brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius just back . 
Harry withdrew the parchment at the foot of the owl , opened it , and read the shortest letter Sirius had written to him : 
Returns the date of the next week's hike in Hogsmeade . 
Harry turned over the parchment and looked at the back of the paper , hoping to read something else , but nothing . 
Hermione read the letter over Harry's shoulder . 
Little girl said : 
Next weekend . Here , write your pen , and then send back to him immediately . 
Harry put the date on the back of the parchment that Sirius sent , stamped the letter at the foot of the brown owl , and watched it fly away again . 
What did Harry expect from the letter ? 
Tips on how to survive underwater ? 
It was too eager for Sirius to tell Snape and Moody that it completely forgot the clue in the egg . 
Asked Ron : 
Sirius wants to know what day to go to Hogsmeade weekend ? 
Harry replied absently . 
Do not know . 
The momentum of happiness that had blossomed in her heart when she saw the silhouette of the owl returned to her now was off . 
Come on , come to Mysterious Element Care . 
Harry did not know it was because of Hagrid's wish for the monsters , or because there were only two of them now , or because he wanted to show that he could do anything . Grubbly - Planhk did , but when he came back to the class , Hagrid just continued his lectures on the code . 
It turns out that Hagrid , knowledgeable about the code , was no less of a monster , though it was clear that the bilettos without venom was a despair . 
Today he managed to somehow catch two white children code . 
Unlike the matured code , the pure white code is pure gold . 
Parvati and Lavender were delighted to see them , and even Pansy Parkinson had a hard time concealing their affection . 
Hagrid said to the class : 
Easier than the big ones . 
They are silver when they are about two years old , and when they grow to four they grow horns . 
When they were completely grown , they had all white feathers , at which time they were about seven years old . 
As young as they are , they do not hesitate to try boys . Try it out , games can come up a little can comfort them if you want to give them some sugar lumps . 
When most of the other pupils were around the two white children , Hagrid split slightly aside , asking Harry , 
How are you ? 
Harry replied , 
Yes , well . 
Hagrid continued : 
Somewhat tiring ? 
Harry said : 
It's a bit too . 
Hagrid patted Harry's large hand on Harry's shoulder , his knees almost falling under the weight of his hand . 
Said Hagrid . 
Harry , I also had a great deal of anxiety before watching the fight with the Gai tail , but I knew you could do anything once you put your mind to it . 
You do not worry anymore . 
I will do fine . 
Did you guess the clue in the egg ? 
Harry nodded , but in spite of that , there was still a frantic impulse in his heart ; he just wanted to admit that his mind had yet to come up with an idea that would enable it to survive under water . clock . 
He looked up at Hagrid - could Hagrid ever go down to the lake several times to deal with the creatures below ? 
After all , Hagrid was the man who took care of everything in the school yard 
Hagrid patted Harry's shoulders again , making it feel as though he had sagged a few inches down the ground . 
Old man : 
You will win ! 
You know . 
You have the same hunch . 
You will win , Harry ! 
Harry did not have the courage to erase Hagrid's smile and confidence on Hagrid's face . 
He tried to make a smile in response , and pretended to like some of the white children , and ran to stroking them like other pupils . 
In the evening before the second test , Harry felt as though he was stuck in a nightmare . 
It is perfectly understandable that , by some miracle , it rotates a suitable spell , the practice of attaining enlightenment within a night is still hard . 
How does it come to this ? 
Why did not he try to solve that in egg earlier ? 
Why is it that the mind wanders during school hours - is there a teacher who has ever talked about breathing under water that it has missed ? 
When Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione in the library , the sun was dipping out . 
They flickered their charms to the other charms , the huge piles of books on the high table flooded their heads , flooded the neck , covered the other . 
Every time I see water on the page is Harry's heart is dancing again , but usually nothing but the things that matter like two water , half a pound of shredded lime leaves , a newt 
From the other side of the table , Ron's voice was straight : 
I can not do anything . 
Nothing . 
Nothing . 
The most promising are the dry talc , which drains the pond water , but can not make enough power to dry the lake . 
Hermione pulled a candle closer to her , murmuring : 
There must be a way . 
People do not come up with a question that can not be answered . 
Her eyes were so tired that she stuck her nose away from the page with only a few inches , carefully reading the tiny letters in the forgotten Spellbook . 
Said Ron : 
Yes . 
Harry , tomorrow you just go down to the lake , yes , head over to the water , yell at the fishermen , give them something they've stolen from you , and wait for them to go . come back to you . That's the best thing you can do , buddy . 
Hermione spat : 
There is a way to do that ! 
There must be a way ! 
She seems to regard the library as lacking in useful information about the subject they are researching as a personal insult . 
Ever since , it has always made her so disappointed . 
Harry exclaimed controversy , bowed down to the book Khunter to play Kham , said : 
I know what I should do . 
I should have learned to animal like Sirius . 
Animal Chemistry is a transformation that a magus can transform into a beast . 
Ron agrees : 
Oh yes , you could have turned into a goldfish anytime you wanted . 
Harry yawned , it was exhausted : 
Or a clone . 
Hermione out : 
It takes a whole year to learn the transformation , and then you have to register your identity and everything else . 
At this point she is checking the book The Magic Mystery and the solution . 
Remember , Professor McGonagall once told us to register with the Bureau of Wrongful Use of the beast that he turned into , personal characteristics , so that he could not abuse the transformation . 
Harry tiredly said : 
Hermione , I'm just joking . 
I know that I can not turn into a clone in the morning 
Hermione wrote The Mysterious Mysteries , exclaimed : 
Oh , it's worthless . 
Does anyone in this world want to make their hairy nose curl up ever ! 
Fred Weasley voices : 
I see nothing at all . The subject is arguing it ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione looked up . 
Fred and George appeared from behind the shelves . 
Asked Ron : 
What are you doing here ? 
George says : 
Please do not do anything . 
Professor McGonagall wants to meet you , Ron , and you , Hermione . 
Hermione looked surprised : 
What's going on ? 
Fred said , 
Who knows but her face is slightly behind the gas . 
George says : 
We had the duty to escort them to her office . 
Ron and Hermione looked at Harry , and Harry felt his stomach slipping . 
Does Professor McGonagall scare Ron and Hermione ? 
Perhaps she had noticed that the two of them helped Harry so much that Harry should have handled the assigned exam by himself . 
Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron : 
Will we meet you in the common room ? 
How many books do you bring back to bring about ? 
Both Ron and Hermione are anxious . 
Harry was not comfortable either . 
It says : 
OK . 
About eight o ' clock , Mrs. Pince turned off all the lights and came to chase Harry out of the library . 
With the weight of the books he could carry , Harry trudged back to Gryffindor's common room , pulled a table in the corner , and continued to study . 
There is nothing in the Book of Optics for the Eccentric Magician , or in the Guide to Medieval Magic , nor to mention the underwater wonders of the Book of Twelve Apocalyptic Books , or in the Book of Terror , or the Power of Wisdom , which we never knew we had and know what to do with them when we are now wise . 
Crookshanks mon men climbed onto Harry's lap and curled up there , drunk . 
The common room is empty . 
Everyone wished Harry good luck the next morning in a voice as cheerful as Hagrid's voice . 
Apparently they all reassure themselves that Harry is about to win a beautiful stage show , as the victories he achieved on the first test . 
Harry could not answer , just nodding , feeling as if there was a golf ball stuck in his throat . 
At about 10 o ' clock , it was alone with Crookshanks in the common room . 
He had left all the remaining books , which Ron and Hermione had not returned yet . 
That's it , she told herself . 
You can not do it . 
You only go down to the lake tomorrow morning to say to the jury 
He imagined it explained that it was impossible to do the test . 
He envisioned Bagman's eyes fluttering , and Karkaroff's amused smile . 
He could almost hear Fleur Delacour say : I knew before , he was too young , he was just a little boy . He also saw Malfoy tinkering with the POTTER or in the crowd ; Hagrid's unbelievable face 
Forgetting Crookshanks lying on his lap , Harry suddenly stood up . 
Crookshanks hissed as he fell to the floor , threw Harry a look of disgust , and walked away with a rag - like , scrub - like tail . 
But Harry rushed up the stairs to get to his bedroom . He wanted to get the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library , and he would be there all night if he needed . 
Fifteen minutes later , Harry opened the library and whispered : " Lumos ! 
The wand was lit up , alongside the bookshelves , with more books - worms and mantras , mermaids and water monsters , books on wizards and witches . About magic inventions , about anything that may contain a little reference that suggests to survive under water . 
Harry took all those books to a table and began to study them in the narrow light of the wand , occasionally watching the clock . 
One o ' clock in the morning the only way that it can continue to sit is to say to yourself , 
The man in the painting on the wall of the bathhouse laughs . 
Harry fluttered like a cork in a bubbly water next to a mermaid's stone , while she stuttered a thunderbolt above her head . 
She laughed maliciously : 
Come here and get on ! 
Come on , jump up ! 
Harry gasped , catching the Thunderbolt , struggling to sink . 
' I ' ll be fine ! give it to me ! 
But she just used the tip of a broomstick to hurl Harry's hips in pain , and then laughed at it . 
Oh , pain to avoid skin Ui ! 
Dear Harry Potter , wake up ! 
do not poke me 
Dobby , you have to poke Harry Potter , you have to wake up ! 
Harry opened his eyes . 
It is still in the library ; The Invisibility Cloak slipped off its head as it fell asleep , and one side of its cheek pressed against the page . The wand was the solution . 
He straightened up , corrected his glasses neatly , blinked in the light of day . 
Dobby shouted : 
Harry Potter need to be pulled up ! 
The second test will start in ten minutes , but Harry Potter 
Harry groaned moaning : 
Ten minutes more ? 
Ten minutes ? 
Harry looked down at his watch . 
Dobby is right . 
It is now nine and twenty minutes . 
A heavy , heavy weight fell through Harry's chest , falling to his stomach . 
Dobby pulled Harry's sleeve , crying : 
Hurry up , Harry Potter ! 
You have to be under the lake with other champions , sir . 
Harry desperately said : 
It's too late , Dobby . 
I will not do the second exam . 
I do not know how to do ... 
Short love shrieked again : 
Harry Potter will do that test . 
Dobby knew Harry Potter had not found the right book , so Dobby had already found it . 
Harry said : 
What ? 
But you do not know what the second test is ? 
Sir . 
Dobby knows ! 
Harry Potter will have to go down to find his 
What to find ? 
and save Boi from the mermaid ! 
What is Bo Teo ? 
Sir , your bosom , your bosopus has given Dobby that sweater ! 
Dobby tugged at the shrunken knit sweater that he was wearing over his striped trousers . 
Harry gasped and asked : 
What ? 
Did they catch Ron ? 
Dobby squealed , 
What Harry Potter will remember most is you ! 
But if more than an hour . 
Harry glared at the dreadlighter with horror , he recited the verses : 
the prospect is black 
Too late , it will lose , it will not come back . ' Dobby ! 
What do I have to do now ? 
I love to dwarf my hands in the pantyhose , pulling out a curl of something that looks a lot like gray - tinted gray tail . 
It says waist : 
Sir , you have to eat this . 
Just before you came down to the lake , ladies gil ! 
Harry looked at the grass and asked , 
What to do ? 
Sir , it will help Harry Potter to breathe underwater . 
Harry asked , 
Dobby , listen , are you sure about this ? 
Harry could not forget the fact that Dobby wanted to help him last time , which eventually led to Harry's right arm having no bone at all . 
But the dear son said earnestly : 
Sir , Dobby sure ! 
Dobby hears all this , Dobby is an elf , sir , he goes around the castle to light the fire , to set fire , to scrub the floor . 
Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody talk in the professor's room , talking about the upcoming exam . Dobby could not let Harry lose his bosom ! 
Harry's suspicions vanished . 
He stood up , picked up the Invisibility Cloak , tucked it into his briefcase , grabbed a grasshopper , and hurried away from the library , with Dobby clinging to his heels . 
As they reached the corridor , Dobby screamed again : 
Sir , Dobby must be in the kitchen to be missing Dobby , Harry Potter , good luck to you ! 
Meet up with you after listening to Dobby ! 
Harry yelled back to Dobby , launching down the corridor and down the first three steps . 
In the vestibule , only the last few left , all the others left the hall after breakfast to go through the double oak door , to see the second exam . 
As Harry flipped over , they watched over Colin and Dennis Creevey and darted down the rock steps to the sunny , cold field . 
As he ran across the lawn , Harry saw the platform that had been erected around the barn area in October , now set up along the other side of the lake , and the tall seats were all set to a focal point . down to the bottom of the lake . 
The thrill of the crowd echoed strangely through the water as Harry ran across the lake to the judges . 
They were sitting at the table covered with gold cloth on the side of the lake . 
Cerdic , Fleur and Krum were both present at the judges ' table , watching Harry hurl at them . 
Harry brakes in a muddy hole and accidentally splashes on Fleur's shirt . 
I am present ! 
A decisive voice decriminating voice : 
Where are you now ? 
The exam is about to start ! 
Harry looked around . 
Percy Weasley is sitting at the jury table - Mr. Crouch does not appear on this page anymore . 
Mr. Bagman was relieved to see Harry appear , saying : 
Alright , Percy ! let Harry breathe ! 
Dumbledore smiled at Harry , but Karkaroff and Maxime were not happy to see it . 
From the look on their faces , it was clear that they thought Harry would not come . 
Harry crouched down , knees bent , sighing , he heard the pain on his hips and felt as if there was a knife between his ribs , which had no time to withdraw . that knife . 
Mr. Bagman is now walking with the champions , leading them along the river to an empty spot about three meters away . 
Harry stood in the last position , next to Krum . 
He wears a bathing suit and a wand in his hand . 
With Harry taking a few steps away from the top contenders , Bagman asked Harry , 
Good , Harry ? 
Know what I'm going to do ? 
Harry rubbed his ribs and said , 
Yes . 
Mr. Bagman snapped Harry's shoulder and returned to the judging panel . 
He pointed his wand at the end of the World Cup , saying Sonorus ! And immediately his voice exploded , echoing through the water , staring at the audience . 
Now , all of our champions are ready to take the second test , and the test will begin shortly after my whistle . 
The champions will have exactly one hour to regain what they have taken . 
Here I count to the third . 
One two Three ! 
The whistle sounded high in the stillness and cold . 
The crowd cheered and applauded . 
Looking to see what other champions are doing , Harry takes off his shoes and socks , pulls out a handful of grass , inserts his mouth , then walks into the lake . 
The water was so cold that Harry felt his feet were flushed like fire , not cold ice . 
The sack of water permeates the person heavy and holds it down as it goes deeper . 
Now the water had come to Harry's knees , and his frosty legs were sliding on flat , muddy slabs . 
She is trying her best to chew the grass in her mouth . 
The grass is so annoying as if it's an octopus , just plastic . 
When the cold water reaches the waist , it stops , swallows , and waits for what happens . 
He heard the laughter from the crowd and knew that it was stupid to go down to the lake without performing any magical powers . 
His dry body made the chicken skin , and the drenched part of the water was numb , a terrible chill that set his hair up . 
Harry started to tremble . 
He avoided looking up at the stage , from which the laughter grew louder and louder , and there was the whistling of the Slytherin students . 
Then , suddenly , Harry felt as if an invisible pill clamping on his nose . 
He tried to suck his breath , but only saw the spiky head ; Its lungs are empty , and it suddenly feels a brutal pain on both sides of the neck . 
Harry raised his hand and hugged his throat and felt under his ear splitting two large gills , pounding gently in the cold air . 
Without stopping to think , Harry made the most immediate action : plunge himself into the water . 
Harry felt the first sip of ice water like the breath of life . Its beginning to turn nowhere . 
He took another sip of the lake and felt the water drift smoothly through the gills , bringing the oxygen back to the brain . 
She stretched her arms outstretched and started to look at them . In the water , its hands are blue and look very ghostly : they are growing more membrane between the fingers together . 
He bent down to look at his legs , seeing that they were longer and that there was a membrane connecting his toes . 
It looks like it has just grown a pair of duck feet . 
Water is no longer cold again , it feels cool cool and people are lightly Harry try to beat a water , amazingly surprised that the propeller can push it through the water quickly . and so far . 
He also realizes now that he can see very clearly , and that he no longer needs to wink . 
So far it has swam in the middle of the lake so far that it no longer sees the bottom . 
He dives to the depths . 
As he plunged into a dark , strange , dark place , the silence was suddenly pressed against Harry's ear . He could only see three meters around him , Through the water , the new landscapes seem to suddenly appear from the darkness in front of it : the jungle grass is wavy , the muddy bottom scattered with shimmering rocks . 
Harry swam a little deeper , out into the middle of the lake , his eyes wide open , staring through the faint gray water around him , trying to peer into the far darkness , where the water became opaque . 
Small fish swim through it like silver light rays . 
A couple of times he saw something bigger moving in front of him , but as he approached it he saw that it was just a big black tree , or a thick hedge . 
No sign of the other champions , no fish at all , nor Ron , and - fortunately - no giant squid . 
Bright green grass stretches before its eyes , sucking in sight , six inches deep , looking like a dense pasture . 
Harry looked ahead without blinking , trying to distinguish the shapes from the darkness , and then , without warning , Harry's ankles were gripped by something . 
Harry turned his body and saw a sea monster , a horned monster in the water , protruding from a patch of grass , his long fingers clutching Harry's ankle , and a Its sharp teeth are out 
Harry hurriedly poked his clawed hand into his slacks pocket and fumbled with his wand . 
Drawing out the wand , there appeared two more sea monsters just emerging from the grass , these two grabbed tight on Harry's robes and dragged him to pull down . 
Relashio ! ( Meaning : spitfire ! ) 
Harry shouted , not expecting to hear any sound . 
From its mouth appeared a large balloon , and its wand , instead of sparks flickering flooded monster , then sprayed them in the air something that looks like bursts of boiling water , because the The rays of the water hit the monsters where they were rubbished by reddish patches that appeared on their green skin . 
Harry withdrew his ankle from the hand of the dragons of the sea monsters , trying to swim as fast as possible , occasionally back shot over the shoulder hot springs . Sometimes he felt a sea monster catching his feet , but he kicked hard , pulling out . 
Finally , feeling his legs combined with a horny head , he looked back and saw a sea monster fluttering , eyes fell away , while the sea monsters frowned at Harry , then fell down the grass . 
Harry slowed down a bit , stuck his wand back in his pocket , looked around , listened again . 
He swam a circle in the water , silencing his ears harder . 
He knew that it was now down to the bottom of the lake , but no movement , except the wavy grass . 
How do you do it ? 
Harry thought he had a heart attack . 
He turned around and saw Ma crying Myrtle , floating in the dim light of his eyes , staring at it through pale white glasses . 
Harry tried to shout : 
Myrtle ! 
But again , no sound came out of his mouth , except for a big bubble . Ma cried Myrtle giggling , really , Myrtle pointed , telling Harry : 
You need to try that over there ! 
I do not go with you where I do not like them , they always pursue me whenever I approach 
Harry raised his thumb to show signs of thanks and rushed again , carefully swimming high above the weeds a little to avoid re - enacting the flood of stalkers in it . 
It also swims for about twenty minutes . 
Now it is swimming across a vast black swamp , every time stirring the mud back to the dormant . 
Finally , she listened to a passage in the song under the water : 
A long hour you will have to find 
And recover what we have taken 
Harry swam faster and soon found a rock protruding from the puddle of water in front of him . 
On a rock with a picture of a mermaid , they are all holding a dash and chasing something like a giant squid . 
Harry swam across the rock , chasing after the creaking sound : 
It's half your time , so do not linger 
lest the thing you seek will rot in here . 
A clump of rugged rocky niches filled with moss suddenly appeared from all sides . These are the windows , Harry saw the faces of the unmatched faces with all the human skulls hanging in the master's baths . 
The mermaid has gray skin and long black hair . 
Their eyes are yellow , their jawbone teeth are yellowed and they wear chains of thick pebbles around their necks . 
They glanced at Harry cunningly as he swam across , one or two of them left the cave to look at it more closely , their silver fish tail splashing in the water , their hands gripping the spears . 
Harry quickly glanced around , soon looking at the rocks when the innumerable countless , some houses have garden seaweed around , Harry even see a monster ship A pile of plugs outside a door . 
At this point , the fishermen poked out from every side to watch Harry eagerly , pointing at his membranes and his fish , and covering his mouth with each other . 
Harry swam across the street and the spectacle struck him . 
There was a large crowd of fishermen floating in front of the sheltered , waterfront - like houses of a village market . 
A chorus of fishermen was singing in the middle , calling on the champions to head towards them , and behind them had a crude statue of a giant fish hewn out of a boulder . 
Four people were tied to the tail of the giant fishman statue . 
Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho chang . 
There was another girl , who was only eight years old , with silver hair and silver , making Harry convinced that it was Fleur Delacour's sister . 
All four of them seem to be very sleepy . Their heads are down on their shoulders , and each bubble bursts out of their mouth . 
Harry hurried up to the hostages , worried that the fishermen would lower their noses to attack it , but they did not do anything . 
The ropes of the grass in the column of the donkey fish are very thick , slippery and very firm . 
In a fleeting glance Harry thought of the knife Sirius had given him at Christmas . 
The knife was locked in a chest in a castle a quarter of a mile away , so it did not help . 
He looked around . 
Many fishermen around it are carrying their TB . 
He swam in the direction of a tall , two - meter - long mermaid with a long green moss and a jagged shark's teeth . 
He tried to make a gesture to show that he wanted to borrow a spear . 
The fisherman laughed and shook his head . 
Black said hoarse voice hoarse : 
We do not help . 
Harry said angrily : 
Help ! 
But only the bubbles came out of Harry's mouth . 
He tried to snatch a spear from a fishman , who jerked the spear away , still shaking his head and laughing . 
Harry turned around and stared intently . 
Make something sharp anything 
At the bottom of the lake are only scattered rocks . 
It dives down and rips a special pointed stone and returns to the statue . 
He began to tear down the rope of Ron by the stone , after several minutes of hard work , the thread was broken . 
Ron floats in the water , just a few inches from the bottom of the tank , completely unconscious and emerges a little by the thrust of the water . 
Harry looked around . 
There are no other silhouettes of the champions . 
Do not know what they are doing ? 
Why do not rush up ? 
She turned to Hermione , raised her pointed stone and began to tear down the rope that bound her . 
Immediately , many gray hands and strong hold up hold it . 
About a half - dozen fishes pulled it out of Hermione , shaking their green hair , laughing . 
One of them said to Harry : 
You only saved your hostage . 
Leave other children 
Harry said angrily : 
No way ! 
But from the mouth it only exits two bubbles . 
Your mission is to save your friend and the others to leave 
Harry screamed , shaking his hand toward Hermione : 
She is my friend too ! 
And I do not want to die ! 
A huge white silvery shadow does not sound out of his mouth . 
Hermione's head resting on her shoulders , while the little girl with platinum hair was pale and pale . 
Harry tried to resist the mermaids , but they laughed even harder , and pulled it away . 
Harry panicked looking around . 
Where are the other champions ? 
Did not know it had enough time to get Ron out of the water and back to rescue the others ? 
Is it possible to find them again ? 
He looked down at the clock to see how much longer - but the watch stopped running . 
At that moment , the box salmon were just above Harry's head . 
She looked up and saw Cerdic swimming toward her . 
Cerdic had a great bubble around his head , which made his face appear big and long . 
Cerdic opened his mouth and said , 
Lost ! 
Fleur and Krum are coming . 
Harry looked relieved , watching Cerdic draw from a knife pocket and cut Cho's ropes . 
He raised Cho up and out of sight of Harry . 
Harry looked around waiting . 
Where are Fleur and Krum ? 
The time is shorter , and according to the lyrics , the hostages will spend an hour 
The mermaid started shouting . 
The fishermen holding Harry tilted their hands a little , glazing at what was behind them , Harry turned around and saw something so big was cutting the water toward them : a man's body in a swimsuit But that shark head is Krum . 
It looks like he's transformed into a fake , but it's a little bad . 
The guy - this shark went straight to Hermione , started to bite and bite the rope tied her . 
The trouble is that Krum's new teeth are so awkwardly arranged to bite something smaller than a dolphin , and Harry is convinced Krum is not careful enough , daring him to bite off Hermione . Candlestick . 
Farting forward , Harry punches Krum's shoulders and reaches for a sharp stone . 
Krum catches up and starts tightly tying Hermione . 
Within a few seconds , he was done . 
He hugged Hermione at the waist and did not look back at him once , starting with Hermione to rise to the surface quickly . 
Now what ? 
Harry thought in despair . 
Had it not been possible for Fleur to be sure that Fleur was coming to rescue her sister , but it did not show any sign . 
Can not do anything other than 
Harry captures the stone Krum had thrown , but the fishmen now surrounded Ron and the little girl , watching him shake his head . 
Harry pulled out his wand . 
Get out of the way ! 
Only bubbles escaped from his mouth , but it had a clear feeling that the fishermen understood what he was saying , because they suddenly stopped laughing . 
Their golden eyes glared at Harry's wand , and they looked frightened . 
Maybe the fish are more scary than him , but Harry can count on them , and the mermaids know nothing more than magic squid . 
Harry shouted , 
I count to three , let's fly away ! 
A bubble burst out of his mouth , and he held up three fingers to make sure the fishmen understood the warning message : 
One ( it shrinks one finger ) , two ( it holds the second finger ) 
The fish are spread out . 
Harry rushes forward and begins to chop off the rope tethering her to the mermaid , and finally free her . 
Harry grasped the little girl's waist , and then he clutched Ron's throaty collar , rising from the bottom of the lake . 
That job is slow , because it can no longer use the hand to membrane to swim forward ; It was only possible to pedal frantically , but Ron and Fleur's sister were like two heavy sackcloth , pulling it down . He also knew that it was in deep water , the water in front of him still dark 
The fishmen came up with it . 
He can see them hovering around it with utmost comfort , watching him grow up and get up a little bit . Will they pull it down ? 
When does the bottom of the lake end ? 
Do not know if they eat human flesh ? 
Harry's foot stiffened as he tried to swim , his shoulder aching awkwardly as he struggled to help her and dragged Ron 
Now , Harry started breathing very hard . 
It felt very painful on either side of her neck as it began to notice how the water was soaking in her mouth , but the darkness was now thinning with certainty . It was able to see the sunlight on her side . top 
Harry wrenches his propeller feet , but discovers that his legs are back to normal . The water that is streaming through his mouth into his lungs starts to feel cold , but he knows the light and air are about three feet away . It must have reached it 
Harry treaded his feet so hard and so fast that it felt as if the muscles of his body were screaming in protest ; its mind is filled with water , it can not breathe anymore , it needs oxygen , it needs to continue , it can not stop 
And then he felt his head rise to the surface of the lake ; The cool , clear , and cool air made his wet face ache like a needle . 
He took a deep breath , feeling like he had never before breathed properly , and just breathed , it just pulled Ron and the little girl up with it . 
Around it , green hair heads jutted out of the water at the same time , but the fishmen smiled at it . 
the crowd in the stands are shouting loudly , causing loud noisy hysteria . People scream shouting , people stand up ; Harry had the impression that Ron and the little girl were dead , but they had mistaken both of them just opened their eyes . 
She was frightened and confused , and Ron just spit out a large sip of water , blinked at the blinding light , turned to Harry and said , 
Wet too ? 
Ron then saw Fleur's sister . 
What do you do ? 
Harry sighed : 
I do not see Fleur coming , I can not let her stay down there . 
Said Ron : 
You're so fucking Harry . 
Why do not you sing that song ? 
Did Dumbledore allow any student to die down there ? 
The song is said 
Just to let you try to get back in time ! 
I hope you did not take the time to play the hero . 
Harry felt as if he was both irritable and irritable . For Ron , it was good . 
It just sleeps , it does not feel so horrible when it is at the bottom of the lake , surrounded by a bunch of fishy whale looks as fierce as a murder . 
Harry said curtly : 
Stop it ! Helping me to help her , I'm not sure she knows how to swim well . 
The two of them pulled Fleur's sister out of the pool , where the judges were watching . 
Dozens of fishermen swim along with them as an army of honorary escorts , singing their screeching waters . 
Harry could see Pomfrey caring for Hermione , Krum , Cerdic , and Cho , all wrapped up in thick blankets . 
Dumbledore and Bagman stood on the edge of the lake to look at Harry and Ron with a bright smile as they danced near . 
And Percy came out and picked them up , looking more white and childish than usual . 
Meanwhile Maxime is trying to keep Fleur Delacour , who is in a panic , struggling to get back to the bottom of the lake . 
Gabrielle ! 
Gabrielle ! 
Is it alive ? 
Was it hurt ? 
Harry tried to shout to Fleur : 
She's fine ! 
But it was so exhausted that it was impossible to say no more , do not say no shout . 
Percy grabs Ron , pulls him out ( Ron : Get out , Percy , you're all right ! ) ; Dumbledore and Bagman pulled Harry up ; Fleur out of Mrs. Maxime's arms , running to hug her sister . 
At that dreaded monster attacked her sister , Gabrielle ! 
She keeps on walking 
Mrs. Pomfrey called : 
The game here . 
She grabs Harry and pulls it toward Hermione and the others , wrapping it in a thick blanket , which makes it feel like a bundle that people use to bind people crazy . 
He was forced to swallow a dose of hot medicine through his throat . 
Smoke both ears . 
Hermione cried : 
Harry , you're good at it ! 
You have done it all by yourself ! 
Harry said : 
Really 
She wanted to tell Hermione the story of Dobby's help , but noticed that Karkaroff was watching it . 
He was the only judge still sitting at the judge's desk , the only judge not to show signs of joy or relief when Harry , Ron and Fleur's younger sister came up safely . 
Harry responded to Hermione so that Karkaroff could hear him too : 
Oh yeah ! 
Krum says : 
I have a water bug in your hair , Hermitage . 
Harry felt that Krum was trying to draw Hermione's attention towards him ; Maybe to remind her that he just saved her from the lake . 
But Hermione brushed off the water bug and said , 
But you were too time - consuming , Harry maybe you lost a lot of time searching for them ? 
I can not find you right now 
Harry's stupidity is growing . 
Now that he was out of the water , he clearly understood that with Dumbledore's safeguard , there was no way he would let a hostage die just because the hostage was not there . 
Why does not it do to get Ron up ? 
It could be the first to return to Cerdic and Krum did not waste any time worrying about anyone else ; They do not value the songs of the mermaid very well . 
Dumbledore was squatting at the edge of the water , chatting with a cocktail - sized fisherman who looked fierce and wild . 
You are uttering the screaming sound that the fishes emit when they are on the water ; Apparently Dumbledore spoke the mermaid . 
Finally he straightened up , turned back to his judges and said : 
I think we need a little workshop before we give it a try . 
Judges jumped again . 
Mrs. Pomfrey came to Ron out of Percy's embrace . 
She led Ron to Harry's place and the others , wrapped it around him , took him pepper pill , and went on to take Fleur and his sister . 
Fleur had some cuts on her face , her hands and shirt were torn , but Fleur did not seem to care about it , nor did she let Pomfrey clean them . 
Fleur said : 
Please take care of Gabrielle ! 
Then Fleur turned to Harry , his voice choked : 
You saved my sister , even though it was not your elf . 
Harry said : 
Ừ ! Now it really thought , just to leave the three girls at the bottom of the lake , the statue is already tied up . 
Fleur bent down , kissing Harry's cheek , two on each side . ( Harry felt his cheeks flush out and if the smoke in his ears would not surprise him ) Then Fleur said to Ron : 
And you too , you rub 
Ron looks extremely hopefully be rewarded , nodded : 
Oh yes , a little help 
Fleur also bent down and kissed him . 
Hermione looked rude , but at the same time , Ludo Bagman's magical sound blasted in their ears , causing them to jolt . The crowd was jammed on the stage suddenly . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we have reached a common decision . 
Fisherman Murcus told us exactly what happened on the bottom of the lake , and so we decided to score the championships - points for over fifty . 
The Fleur Delacour , despite the excellent use of the spell - ball , has been attacked by a sea monster while approaching a target to rescue a hostage . 
We give twenty - five points to Fleur Delacour . 
Applause in the stands . 
Fleur shook his head , splendidly saying , 
I'm just pointing a goat . 
Cerdic Diggory , also uses the spellbot , and is the first person to return with the hostage , although the game is one minute out of the set time . 
The cheers rang from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd ; Harry sees Cho giving Cerdic a radiant look . 
So we rewarded Cerdic Diggory with forty - seven points . 
Harry's heart sank . 
If Cerdic is now , it is certainly more time . 
Viktor Krum uses a form of incomplete transfiguration , but still works , and is the second person to return to the same hostage . 
Game Krum is forty points 
Mr Karkaroff clapped his hands in the most intense manner , showing his utmost care . 
Mr. Bagman continued : 
Harry Potter uses grass to bring the best performance . 
Harry returns last , and the set time is one hour . 
However , Murphy's female headman told us that Potter was the first person to reach the hostages , and that it was late because he decided to rescue all the hostages . Only his own hostage . 
Ron and Hermione both gave Harry a half - frustrated , half - hearted look . 
And here , Mr. Bagman glared at Karkaroff in disgust : 
Most of the judges felt that this showed a good character and that Harry deserved the full score . 
However , Potter's score is forty - five points . 
The bunny Harry jumped up one . 
So now it is leading the list with Cerdic . 
Ron and Hermione were surprised to see Harry , then burst out laughing and start the summer with the crowd cheering the sky . 
Ron shouted at the noise of the crowd : 
Good job , Harry ! 
After all you are not foolish ! 
You have proved your good personality ! 
Fleur clapped his hands , but Krum was not happy at all . 
He tried to talk to Hermione again , but she was busy preoccupied with Harry so not paying attention . 
Mr. Bagman continued to announce : 
The third and final test will be conducted at the twilight of the twenty - fourth day of June . 
Champions will be notified about the exam one month before the examination . 
Thank you all for supporting the champions ! 
It is done ! ... 
When Mrs. Pomfrey started pounding the champion and hostage to the castle to dry her clothes , Harry was surprised to think : so it's over , it's over . It will not have to worry about anything until the date of the crack . June sixth . 
When stepping up the steps to the castle , Harry decided : next time I go to the village of Hogsmeade I will buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year ! 
Chapter 27 WALKING BACK 
One of the best things that happened following the second test was that everyone was eagerly listening to the details of what had happened under the lake , so that Ron was sharing Harry's popularity . 
Harry noticed that the versions of the story were slightly different after each episode . 
At first , Ron told the truth ; In keeping with the story told by Hermione , Dumbledore had the magic to make all of the students sleep in Professor McGonagall's room , and before he had reassured them that they would be perfectly safe to wake up . they come out of the water again . 
Yet , a week later , Ron again tells a horrible kidnapping story , according to which , one hand it must fight back fifty mercenaries armed with his . 
These fishmen must beat it again to tie it back . 
But I have a wand hidden in my sleeve . 
Ron pleaded with Padma Patil , who seems to enjoy the fact that Ron is now widely noticed and always has the subject to tell it whenever they walk down the corridors . 
I can catch those idiots in the sea whenever I want . 
Asked Hermione , 
What was he doing at that time to snore at the fish ? 
Ron's ears are red , and since then , he has returned the original sleeping dream story back to its original state . 
Nowadays people are teasing Hermione too amenable that Viktor Krum will remember most of her temperament . 
In March , the weather became dry , but when they came out in the yard , the spells burned their skin and hands . 
Letters are delayed because they must avoid the wind on the flight . 
The brown owl that Harry sent to Sirius to announce his weekend visit to Hogsmeade Village was back at breakfast on Friday , with half of his hair growing upright . 
Harry had not yet torn Sirius's mail out , and the owl flew away , obviously afraid to send the mail out again . 
Sirius's letter is as brief as before : 
Go to the last level outside the village of Hogsmeade ( past Dervish and Banges ) at 2 pm on Saturday . How much food do you bring ? 
Asked Ron suspiciously : 
Did he return to Hogsmeade ? 
Hermione said : 
Seems like that , what else ? 
Harry anxiously said : 
I did not understand him , he was arrested 
Said Ron : 
But he's still safe now , right ? There is no time to kick the dementors again . 
Harry folded the letter , anxious . 
To be honest , he wanted to meet Sirius again . 
So that last lesson of the afternoon - two drugs - when step down the stairs leading to the basement , it feels very good , different times . 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were cluttered outside the classroom with Slytherin daughters , Pansy Parkinson's . 
They were looking at something that Harry did not know was what , and laughed loudly . 
Pansy's pensive face looked eagerly around Goyle's wide back as Harry , Ron , and Hermione came close . 
She laughed hugging : 
They are ! 
They are ! 
And even the Slytherins , Harry saw Pansy holding a magazine in his hand - the Sorcerer's Week . 
The cover image of the magazine cover shows a curly - haired witch smiling at a tooth and holding a wand pointing to a large piece of sponge cake . 
Pansy says loudly : 
Hey , Granger , you can get some cool stuff in here ! 
Pansy threw the magazine at Hermione . 
Hermione caught her hand and looked stunned . 
At that moment , the door to the basement room opened , Snape told all the students inside . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione went to the end table as always . 
When Snape turned his back on them to write on the ingredients table of the poison that day , Hermione rushed over to the magazine under the table . 
Finally , right in the middle two pages of the magazine , Hermione found what they were looking for . 
Harry and Ron leaned closer to read . 
A color photograph of Harry comes with a short article entitled : 
Harry Potter's secretive pride 
A teenager may not be the same as any other teenager - but still a teenager experiencing the usual teens . 
Rita Skeeter writes . 
Lack of love due to death 
In the tragedy of parents , the ten - year - old Harry Potter thought he found solace in a girlfriend at Hogwarts School , a girl from the Muggle family , named Hermione Granger . 
Unbelievably , the boy soon will suffer another emotional shock in a life that has been so painful for him . 
Granger , an ordinary but ambitious girl , seems to have a great witch , but Harry Potter alone can not match . 
Since Viktor Krum , Hungary's hockey player and a hero in the Quidditch World Cup , went to Hogwarts School , Granger flirted with the feelings of both boys . 
Krum was fascinated by the granger Granger , who invited her to visit him in Bungar y next summer , claiming he had never felt this way for another girl . 
However , perhaps not the least of her sexual charms , she has captured the attention of the two unhappy young men . 
Pansy Parkinson , a beautiful fourth - grader , said : " The little girl is really ugly , but he's a good kid , he's smart . 
In my opinion , that is the way it has attracted boys . 
Of course , Love Pharmacy was banned at Hogwarts , and certainly Dumbledore had to investigate this . 
At this point , those who wish for the good of Harry Potter would hope that , next time he will give his heart to a more worthy candidate . 
Ron whispered to Hermione as she stared down at the article : 
I told you already ! 
I told you not to upset Rita Skeeter ! 
She will paint her into one of a kind daughter ! 
Hermione was surprised and began choking on her laughter . 
She repeated : 
Daughters ? 
She glanced at Ron , who shivered as the giggle was compressed . 
Ron's ears are red , it's anti - 
That's how my mother called them . 
Hermione was still laughing , throwing the Sorceress Woman in the vacant chair next to her . 
If that was the best thing Rita could do , she would not be so good at it . 
Damn old garbage ! 
She looked over at the Slytherin students sitting across the room , the two of them watching Harry and Hermione closely watching the two of them saddened by the article . 
Hermione gave them a mocking smile and a wave , and she and Harry and Ron began to pull out the ingredients they needed to make the Pill . 
Ten minutes later , while holding a bowl of beetles , Hermione said , 
So , there is also a laughing place ! 
How could she know me ? ... 
Asked Ron : 
Know what ? 
You do not mix the drug that , or is it ! 
do not be stupid 
Hermione snatched up Ron , then went back down the beetle : 
No , how did she know that Viktor invited me to visit him in the summer ? 
Hermione flushed her face to say this and deliberately avoided Ron's eyes . 
Ron dropped his pestle , causing a loud sound . 
What ? 
Said Hermione , 
He suggested to me after pulling himself out of the lake . 
Immediately after the picture throws the shark's head away . 
Mrs. Pomfrey gave each of us a blanket and the picture was about to pull herself out of the jury to prevent them from hearing them , and the photo said if she was not busy doing summer vacation , she Want 
And , you say ? 
Ron picked up his pestle and crushed it on the table , a half inch from his mortar , because his eyes were staring at Hermione . 
Hermione continued : 
And he was saying that he had never had the same feelings with anyone else . 
Hermione's face was so red that Harry felt the warmth of Hermione's face radiating . 
But how could Rita Skeeter hear him ? 
Are you there ? 
Do you have an Invisibility Cloak ? 
Or perhaps she sneaked into the school grounds to watch the competition 
Ron kept the pestle on the table so strong that the table almost broke , repeating it : 
So you say ? 
Well , I was anxious to see if you were okay with Harry ? 
A voice as cold as ice came up behind the three of them making them jerk up : 
Miss Granger 
Well , even if your social life is definitely attractive , I must also ask you not to discuss the topic in my classroom . 
Except Gryffindor ten points . 
Snape's teacher glided to their table while they were still engrossed in the conversation . 
The class now heads to their side . 
Malfoy took advantage of this opportunity and glanced at the POTTER or PATTERN badge across the room toward Harry . 
With the Sorcerer's Weekly , Snape added : 
Again , read the magazine under the desk again ? 
Except for the Gryffindor's ten more points , but of course 
Snape's eyes widened as he saw Rita Skeeter's article . 
Of course , Potter must keep a close watch on the news about it 
The basement shook with laughter from the Slytherin students , and a grinning smile made Snape's thin lips . 
To make Harry mad , Snape started reading the article aloud . 
Harry Potter's ulterior hatred , rub it , Potter , how hard is that ? A teenager , maybe not like a bad boy . 
Harry could feel his face burning . 
Snape stopped at the end of each line to give the Slytherin cushion with a laugh . 
The article was read by ten - year - old Snape more than ten times . 
Even Hermione is now as red as gac . 
Those who wish good things for Harry Potter hope that next time he will give his heart to a more worthy candidate . 
Seriously touching . 
Snape smirked , scrounged the magazine and the laughs continued to resound from the Slytherins . 
Wow . 
I think it is best to divide the three , so that you can concentrate more on the medicine than the life of your affair . 
Weasley , sit down . 
Game Granger 
, to sit over there , next to Parkinson . 
Oh , Potter , my desk , go , now . 
Harry threw an empty mess of material and his bag at the cauldron and dragged him to the basement , where the empty table was . 
Mr. Snape followed him , sat at the teacher's desk and watched Harry take the things in his cauldron . 
Determined not to see Snape , Harry staggered again to the bowl of beetles , imagining Snape's face under each blow . 
As the whole class settled , Snape quietly said , 
Are all these press magazines seemingly inflating the already massive head of the game , Potter ? 
Harry did not reply . 
He knew that Snape was trying to provoke him . 
Previously he did so . 
Surely he was hoping to find an excuse for Gryffindor's deduction of fifty more points before the end of the semester . 
Perhaps the effort is under the illusion that the whole world is mesmerizing . 
Mr. Snape continued to speak in a small voice that no one else could hear ( Harry was relentlessly grinning at his beetle , even though it had turned them into a very fine powder ) . 
But I accept all the pictures of the game appear many times in the press . For me , Potter , it's nothing more than a scoundrel who rules everything under it . 
Harry shredded the beetle in the cauldron and started cutting ginger . 
His hand was a little shaky with anger , but it kept his eyes looking down , as if he had not heard what Snape was saying to him . 
Snape continued to speak in a lighter tone , but more dangerous . 
So I have good advice for you , Potter . 
Regardless of whether there is such a big knick knack , how big would it be if I caught a break in my office again ? 
Forgetting deaf and dumb pretenders for now , Harry furiously said : 
You never scurry to the office of the teacher ever . 
Snape's eyes were unaware of Harry's face : 
Snake skin . 
Grass fish 
Both are from my own stockpile , and I know who steals them . 
Harry glared back at Snape , definitely not blinking or making a mistake . 
The fact is that Harry did not steal any of Snape's two items . 
Snakes were stolen by Hermione when they were in their sophomore year - they needed it to make a pandemic - and at that time Snape was always suspicious of Harry , but he could never prove it . OK . 
And the grass of the fish , of course , was pointed at Dobby . 
Harry blatantly lies : 
I do not understand what you are saying . 
Snape snapped . 
I got out of bed the night before my office was broken into . 
I know that , Potter . 
Now , maybe Moody Eyes - crazy has joined the fun loving club , but I still will not ignore the behavior of the game ! go out in the office at night , Potter , do not blame me ! 
Harry coldly replied : 
Yes . 
It's back to work cutting ginger : 
You will see it in the beginning if you ever want to go there . 
Snape's eyes flashed . 
He poked a hand in his black robes pocket . 
In a moment of confusion , Harry thought Snape was about to draw his wand to curse it . 
But then Harry saw Snape pull out a small glass bottle containing an absolutely clear medicine . 
Harry looked at that . 
Snape's eyes returned to danger , he said : 
Do you know this , Potter ? 
Harry replied , this time completely honest : 
Are not . 
Master Snape's voice was so vicious : 
This is a Veritaserum - a potion that is so powerful that only three drops are enough to get the most out of the whole class . 
Currently , the use of this drug is strictly controlled by the guidelines of the Ministry of Magic . 
But unless the content of the game , otherwise you can see my hand to squeeze this drug - he gently shake the glass bottle - no water squeeze drink every night . 
And then , Potter and I will find out the truth is that once you have flirted with us office . 
Harry did not say anything . 
He turned back to the ginger trimming , picking up the knife , again began to cut the ginger into thin slices . 
He did not like it , he did not want to give Snape a chance to taste it a bit . 
He restrained a shudder when he thought of what might have come out of his mouth if Snape gave him a drink . In addition to causing a whole bunch of people - including Hermione and Dobby - The other thing he wanted to hide was that it contacted Sirius and - his intestines cramped with this thought - his emotions about Giving it to the ginger sliced ​​ in the cauldron , and wondered if it had So imitate Moody and this word only drink his own gourmet only . 
There was a knock on the classroom door . 
Said Snape , his usual voice : 
Come in . 
The class looked around to see Mr. Karkaroff come in . 
Everyone looked at him as he walked to the desk of Snape's master . 
He twisted his fingers around his goatee's beard and turned up to spit . 
As he approached Snape's desk , Karkaroff suddenly said , 
We need to talk . 
He seemed determined not to let anyone hear what he said , so he barely kissed his lips ; as if he was a mediocre one . 
Harry kept his eyes on the sliced ​​ thin ginger , but his ears listened intently . 
Snape said quietly : 
After school I will talk to you , Mr. Karkaroff . 
But Mr. Karkaroff interrupted him : 
I want to say now , while you can not slip away , Severus . 
Hush you keep me away . Snape snapped . 
Wait after school . Immediately holding a measuring cup to see if it filled enough tatoo , Harry glanced glance at these two adults . 
Mr. Karkaroff was very anxious , and Snape was angry . 
Mr. Karkaroff kept wandering around the desk of Mr. Snape for the rest of his two - hour study session . 
He apparently intended to prevent Snape from disappearing at the end of the session . 
Too impatient to hear what Mr. Karkaroff said , Harry deliberately broke down the tattoo bottle when it was only two minutes away that the bell rang , so it had the excuse of dipping down the cauldron and cleaning the floor while the Other students go out of class . 
He heard Snape attack Karkaroff : 
What's so urgent ? 
This . 
Harry watched from the edge of his cauldron , saw Karkaroff unbutton his left sleeve to show Snape something in his forearm . 
Mr. Karkaroff said , still trying his best not to move his lips . 
You see ? 
It has never been so clear , never since 
Snape grumbled : 
Clearway ! 
Snape's black eyes swept across the classroom . 
Mr Karkaroff's voice began to puzzled : 
But he must have noticed 
Snape's throat blocked Mr Karkaroff's throat : 
We talk about it later , Karkaroff ! 
Potter , what are you doing ? 
Harry straightened up and handed Snape the wet cloth he was holding . 
She spoke innocently : 
Teacher , I clean the tattoo that I accidentally spilled . 
Mr Karkaroff turned his heels and strode out of the basement room . 
He looked worried and angry . 
Not wanting to stay alone with Snape , who is extremely angry , Harry tosses his books and materials in and out of the room at the fastest rate possible to tell Ron and Hermione what he has just witnessed . 
At noon the next day , Harry , Ron and Hermione leave the castle just to see a faint silver sun shining down on the school grounds . 
The weather is milder than any other time of the year . 
And by the time they reached Hogsmeade Village , the three of them took off their coats and put on their shoulders . Sirius ' food , they carry it in Harry's bag ; They had stolen a dozen chicken legs , a loaf of bread , and a bottle of pumpkin juice that they had been eating at lunch . 
The children went to Witch Dressing Gown to buy a gift for Dobby . 
There they gleefully choose the most horrible stockings they can find , including a pair of gold stripes , and a silver star , and another pair of socks scream as they become too heavy smell 
Then , at one and a half hours , they headed up the High Street , across the Dervish and Banges , and went out to the edge of the village . 
Harry had never been this way before . 
The trail leading them out into the wilderness around the village of Hogsmeade . 
Here the more and more gradually empty houses , gardens are wide . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione walk towards the foot of the mountain , where Hogwarts is nestled under the shadow . 
Then they turned at a corner and saw the end of the road steps to climb over the fence . There a giant black puppy was waiting for them , 
The dog's forelegs rested on top of the fence bar , and his mouth held onto the newspaper . 
The dog looks very familiar 
When they come near . 
Harry said : 
Sirius ! 
The black dog inhaled Harry's bag of food eagerly , his tail panting , and he turned back , starting to run away from the little ones , crossing a long , sprawling bush . jagged mountain foot . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione climbed the stairs across the wall to follow the dog . 
Sirius led them to the foot of the mountain , where the ground was covered with pebbles and rocks . 
With four legs , Sirius easily crossed the land , but with Harry , Ron and Hermione , they were close to death when they followed Sirius . 
They follow Sirius up higher and higher , climbing up the mountain . 
For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep , curving and rocky path , following Sirius's scabbard . 
Everyone was sweating under the sun , the straps of the bag of food down , cut Harry's shoulder ache . 
And finally , Sirius slipped away , and upon reaching the place where he had disappeared , they saw a narrow slit in the middle of the cliff . 
They spit in , and found themselves in a cool , shimmering cave . At the end of the cave is a Buckbeak code with a rope tied around a rope . 
Buckbeak is a gray half - horse , while the other half is a giant eagle . 
Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes flickered when he saw three Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
The three of them bowed low to greet me with code , and after scrutinizing them arbitrarily for a moment , Buckbeak knelt at the knees of her scaly forelegs , and allowed Hermione to step forward and pounce on the one . Buckbeak's feather neck . 
Instead , Harry watched as the black dog was turning his godfather back . 
Sirius wore a gray tunic ; the one he had worn since he escaped from Azkaban Prison . 
His black hair was longer than when he appeared in the fireplace , and his hair was messy and dull . 
I look down on the light . 
After he released the Prophet and threw it on the floor of the cave , Sirius said : 
Chicken ! 
Harry opened his bag , took out a bunch of chicken legs and bread . 
Sirius opened the package , took a big thigh , sat down on the cave floor , teeth torn a large piece and said : 
Thank you . 
For a long time , he lived mainly with rat meat . 
Can not steal too much food in the village of Hogsmeade , he began to notice . 
He grinned at Harry , but Harry grinned at him involuntarily . 
Harry asked : 
What are you doing here , Sirius ? 
Sirius gnawed at the bone like a dog gnawing and said , 
Doing the duty of a godfather . do not worry baby , you pretend a cute dog is cute . 
He still laughed , but noticed the anxiety on Harry's face , he said more earnestly : 
I want to be present . 
My last letter , let's just say things are becoming more subdued . 
Every morning I go to the newspapers to throw people away , and just read that he is barely the only one to see this worrying . 
He nodded toward the yellow Prophets on the floor , and Ron picked it up and opened it . 
But Harry stared at Sirius anxiously : 
What if they catch you ? 
What if they see you ? 
Sirius shrugged and continued to enjoy the chicken thighs : 
His three children and Dumbledore are the only ones who know that he has animal morphology . 
Ron nudged Harry and handed him the Daily Prophet . 
There are two sheets , one with the headline : Bartemius Crouch's secret disease . 
The second one : the witch of the Ministry still missing missing the Minister of Magic now personally involved . 
Harry scanned the story of Mr. Crouch . 
Every phrase hit his eyes : Never seen in public since November seemingly deserted St . Mungo Hospital specialized in Disability and Illness declined to comment The Ministry does not confirm the news serious disease 
Harry said slowly : 
They make the story sound as if he is dying . 
But he could not be so ill in that country if he managed to come here 
Ron informs Sirius : 
My brother is Crouch's assistant . 
Mr Crouch said the illness was too much work . 
Harry still read the article , saying slowly : 
He looks really sick , at the last time I saw him , the night that his name was dropped on that cup of fire . 
Said Hermione , her voice a little shaky . 
She was panting on Buckbeak , who was chewing on the chicken bone that Sirius had given him . 
She continued : 
I bet he is sorry he did so I bet he is new now feel different when he is no longer Winky next to him care . 
Ron threw Hermione a gloomy look , whispering to Sirius : 
Hermione is haunted by the elves . 
But Sirius showed great interest : 
Mr. Crouch chased him home ? 
Yes , at the Quidditch World Cup . 
Harry tells the story of the appearance of the Dark Sign , and Winky is spotted at the battle with Harry's wand clutched in his hand , and how enraged Mr. Crouch is . 
When Harry finished talking , Sirius stood up again and started walking back and forth in the cave . 
A moment later he said , holding a new chicken thigh swung into the air : 
Let me arrange this story to give it a layer of order . 
You see the first elf in the Hall of Honor . 
She is holding a seat for Mr. Crouch , right ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione said : 
Yes , yes . But Mr. Crouch did not come to watch the match ? Harry said : 
No . 
I think he's too busy . Sirius silently walked around the cave . 
Then he said : 
Harry , after leaving the audience , do you check whether the wand is in your shirt pocket ? 
Harry thought carefully : 
Oh no . 
You do not need to use it until you go to the forest . 
And when you put your hand in the pocket to find it , just find the magic tube only . 
Harry stared at Sirius : 
Did the saying say that someone calling the Dark Sign stole his wand from the Hall of Honor ? 
Sirius said : 
that can be very 
Hermione asserted : 
Winky did not steal that wand ! 
Sirius ' brows shrieked as he continued walking , he said , 
The elf is not the only one in the Hall of Fame . 
And who else is sitting behind you ? 
Harry replied , 
That pile of people . 
Some Bulgarian ministers , Cormelius Fudge , Malfoy family 
Ron suddenly shouted : 
Malfoy family ! 
Ron shouted so loudly that the Buckbeak had to fend off his head restlessly . 
It resolved : 
I dare to fish the thief is the main Lucius Malfoy ! 
Sirius asked : 
Anyone else ? 
Harry said : 
No one else . 
Hermione reminded : 
Still 
There is also Ludo Bagman . 
Oh , right . 
Sirius continued to walk . 
He said : 
He does not know much about Bagman except that he was formerly the Gunman of Wimbourne . 
What does he look like ? 
Harry said : 
Yes , he is good . 
He asked me to help you in the Magic Trilogy . 
Sirius thought even more : 
Now he wants to help ? 
I wonder why he did it again ? 
Harry said : 
He said he liked her . 
Hmmm 
Sirius was very anxious . 
Hermione told Sirius : 
We saw him in the forest just before the Black Sign appeared . 
She turned to Ron and Harry : 
Do you remember ? 
Said Ron : 
Oh , but he did not stay in the woods , did he ? 
When we told him about the violence , he went to the campsite . 
Hermione responded : 
How do you know ? 
How do you know that invisible cliffs go to where ? 
Asked Ron suspiciously : 
Stop it ! 
Are you saying that you think Ludo Bagman has called up the Black Sign ? 
Hermione stubbornly said : 
He calls it more reasonable than Winky . 
Ron looked up at Sirius . 
I told you , I told you that Hermione was haunted by the elves 
But Sirius raised his hand to tell Ron to shut up : 
When the Dark Mark was called up , and the elf was found holding Harry's wand , what did Crouch do ? 
Harry said : 
He drove around the bushes , but no one else was there . 
Sirius walks , muttering : 
Of course , of course , he wanted to give it to anyone , not his own elf , and then he dumped the elf ? 
Said Hermione , with a heavy voice . 
right . 
He chased her , just because she did not stay in the tent so that the crowded crowd would crush her off . 
Said Ron : 
Hermione , can you forgive the elf ? Sirius shook his head . 
Hermione has a better appreciation of Crouch than Ron , 
If you want to know what a man is , look at how he treats people lower than themselves , not with their peers . 
He took a hand to clench his unshaven bearded face , obviously he was brainwashed . 
All of this absence of Mr. Crouch has been lost to make sure his eldest grooms were at the Quidditch World Cup , but then he did not come to see . 
He had to work hard to restore the Magic Trilogy , and then he did not even bother to come out . It was not like Crouch himself . 
If he had been sick for a while , even if he had been sick for a day , he would have swallowed Buckbeak . 
Harry said : 
So do you know Mr. Crouch ? 
Sirius's face darkened . 
He suddenly seemed scared he was scary at the first evening Harry met his face , the evening that Harry still thought Sirius was a killer . 
He said softly : 
Well , you know Mr. Crouch well . 
He was the one who ordered the detention of Azkaban without trial . 
Ron and Hermione exclaimed : 
What ? 
Harry said : 
Make sure you play ! 
Sirius took another piece of chicken thigh , saying : 
No , he was not joking . 
Do you know that Mr. Crouch was formerly the Minister of Law Enforcement ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione shook their heads . 
Sirius said : 
He is considered as the leading candidate for the next Minister of Magic . 
Barty Crouch is a great magician , powerful magician and power - hungry magician . 
read Harry's expression , Sirius said : 
But he was no supporter of Voldemort . 
No , Barty Crouch was always loud against the Dark side . 
But then there are also many who opposed the Dark side , you do not understand the children are too small . 
Ron said , his voice furiously : 
Your father said the same in the World Cup . 
Why do not you try to say that we understand ? 
A smile flashed through Sirius's haggard face . 
Okay , I ' ll try 
He walked around the cave and said , 
Imagine that Voldemort is in control at this time . 
You do not know who your supporters are , do not know who is working for him and who does not . 
You know he can control people to the point where they can do terrible things they can not stop themselves . 
You scare yourself , afraid of your whole family , your friends . 
There are more news stories about more deaths , more disappearances , more torture than the Ministry of Magic every week , they do not know what to do , they try to hide the Muggles , At the same time , Muggles were killed . 
Terrorism around Troubled chaos that was the situation before when Voldemort was mighty . 
Well , such times reveal the best in some people as well as the worst in some people . 
Mr. Crouch's principles may have worked well in the beginning , he was unclear . 
He promoted rapid advancement in the Ministry of Magic , and began to take very harsh measures against Voldemort's supporters . 
Gods are given new powers - such as the right to kill , not just the right to arrest . 
And he was not the only one being blamed without the trial of the Azkaban Dementors . 
Crouch used violence to suppress violence and allowed the Unforgivable Word to be used against even those who were just suspects . 
You can say that he is as cruel and violent as many of the Dark side . 
But his attention , Crouch also has his supporters , many thought he was doing the right thing and many witches and wizards also campaigned for him to take charge at the Ministry of Magic that's it 
When Voldemort disappeared , the issue of Crouch's supremacy was only a matter of time . 
But unfortunately something happened Sirius smiled grimly : 
Crouch's own son was arrested along with a Death Eater group when they tried to run out of the Azkaban prison . 
Obviously they were looking for a way to find Voldemort and bring him back to power . 
Hermione gasped . 
Crouch's son arrested ? 
Sirius tossed the chicken bone to Buckbeak , sowed himself to the ground , plopped beside the loaf of bread , and broke the loaf of bread . 
He said : 
Right . 
He thought it was a bad shock to old man Barty Crouch . 
He should have spent more time caring for his family , right ? 
Maybe he should go to work sometime sooner to find out his own son . 
Sirius began to chew the big pieces of bread . 
Harry asked : 
Is Crouch's son Death Eater ? 
Sirius is still swallowing bread : 
Can not know . 
When his son was put in prison , he himself was in Azkaban prison . 
This information is all the information he learned since he left the prison . 
The boy was exactly caught up with a group of people that he dared betray that they were Death Eaters . 
But maybe the guy in the situation right , like the Winky elf , for example . 
Hermione whispered : 
Did Crouch try to get his son out of the prison ? 
Sirius burst out laughing more like a dog barking : 
Mr. Crouch brought his son out of prison ? 
I thought you appreciated Mr. Crouch , Hermione ! 
Anything that threatens to tarnish his reputation must be removed ; He has spent his life trying to become Minister of Magic . 
You have seen him chase his neck without mourning a devoted elf just because it causes him to once again be associated with the Dark Sign . 
Does not that tell you what kind of man he is ? 
Crouch's cousin was just deep enough to take him to court , and as a whole it was no different than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated him . It escaped it , Azkaban . 
Harry said quietly , " Do you give him the Azkaban dictator ? " 
Sirius is no longer happy at all : 
right . 
You saw the Dementors of Azkaban carrying the little boy , he stood behind the bars of his uncle watching them . 
He was only about nineteen . 
They took him in a chamber near his cell . 
When it was dark , the boy cried for his mother . 
But a few days later it became more quiet than the rest of them were all silent except when the prisoners screamed while sleeping . 
For a moment , the look of the uranium in Sirius ' eyes softened and became softer than ever , as if the shutters were closed behind them . 
Harry asked : 
So he is still in Azkaban ? 
Said Sirius voice , 
No , no , boy is not in it anymore . 
One year after it was put in , it died . 
Photo dead ? 
Sirius said bitterly : 
It is not the only one . 
Most of the people were crazy , and many did not eat at all . 
They lose their craving . 
And because the Azkaban Prisoners are sniffing 
Death , so just to see them excited that people immediately know that Death is coming . 
When he was in jail , the boy seemed seriously ill . 
Crouch is an important member of the council of ministers , he and his wife are allowed to visit the child on the dying bed . That was the last time he saw Barty Crouch , his wife , who could not walk past his cell . 
She died shortly afterward , apparently . too painful . 
Death is dying like a son . 
Mr. Crouch never returned to take son . 
The Dementors bury Azkaban outside the fort ; You saw them doing it . 
Sirius tossed the bread that he had just put on his mouth , and instead of continuing to eat , he took the bottle of pumpkin juice to his mouth and drank it . 
She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and continued to say : 
So Mr. Crouch lost everything when he thought he had achieved it all . 
Just minutes ago he was a hero , preparing to become the Minister of Magic , but only minutes later , his son died , his wife died , and his family was disgraced . Say , his reputation dissipated . 
After the boy died , people began to feel sympathy for the boy a little , began to wonder why where a kind man of such a noble family to the farm . 
It was concluded that his father would not have taken care of it . 
Cornelius Fudge won the position of Minister of Magic , and Crouch was pushed through the Ministry of International Cooperation . 
The silence lasted long after Sirius finished telling the story . 
Harry was thinking of the way that Crouch's eyes almost bulged as he looked down at his obese elf in the forest , after the World Cup match . 
Well , this is why Crouch reacted so violently to Winky when it was revealed under the Dark Sign . 
It would have evoked the grieving memories of his son , and the scandal , along with his humiliating drop at the Ministry . 
Harry told Sirius : 
Mr Moody says Mr Crouch is being hunted down by the Dark Hulk . 
Sirius nodded : Well , I heard that it was a crazy thing for him . 
In his opinion , he would have believed that he could regain the public's confidence before catching a Death Eater . 
Ron looked at Hermione with triumph : 
And he sneaked into Hogwarts to rummage Snape's office ! 
Sirius said : 
Oh , and that does not mean anything . 
Shouted Ron : 
Yes , yes ! 
But Sirius shook his head : 
Listen , if Mr. Crouch wants to investigate Mr. Snape , why do not you come to judge the competition ? It was an ideal excuse for him to regularly visit Hogwarts and keep an eye on Mr. Snape . 
So , according to you , does Snape master something ? 
Harry poses the question as Hermione interrupts it : 
No matter what you say , I will not listen . 
Dumbledore trusted Snape 
Ron loses patience : 
Well , Hermione . 
I know Dumbledore is very clever and this way , but that does not mean that a dark sorceress is really clever can not clap 
Then why did Snape save Harry in the first year ? 
Why do not you let Harry die ? 
I do not know - maybe he's afraid Dumbledore got his neck out of school 
Harry growled , making Ron and Hermione stop arguing to listen . 
How do you think Sirius ? 
Sirius said , pondering Ron and Hermione . 
I think they both have the same opinion . 
Since discovering Snape was teaching at Hogwarts , he wondered why Dumbledore had recruited him . 
Mr. Snape is always fascinated with Dark Arts , and the whole school knows that . 
Studying with him , he is a scumbag , fluttering , ear hair crushed . 
Sirius added , making Harry and Ron look at each other grinning . 
When he was new to school , Snape knew more than half of the seventh curses , and he was one of the Slytherin icebergs that most of the gangs had become Death Eaters . 
Sirius's fingers spread out and began to name : 
Rosier and Wilkes - both killed by the gods a year before Voldemort sa . 
The Lestranges , are in Azkaban . 
Avery - as he listens , he has been flipping through the accident by saying that he was forced to act under an authoritative curse - he is still being pursued . 
But as you know , Snape has not even been accused of being a Death Eater . 
But it does not matter . 
There are still unidentified floods . 
And Mr. Snape is certainly smart enough to keep himself from getting in trouble . 
Said Ron : 
Snape knew quite well Karkaroff , but wanted to hide it . 
Harry said , 
Yes , you must have seen the face of Snape when Mr. Karkaroff appeared in the poison class yesterday ! 
Mr. Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape , he said why Snape kept dodging him . 
He looked worried . 
He told Snape to look at something on his arm , but I could not see what it was . 
Sirius asked , bewildered , anxious : 
Did he give Mr. Snape something in his hand ? 
Sirius's fingers trailed in the tangled hair . 
Then he shrugged his shoulders : 
Bear in mind , I do not know what that meant , but if Karkaroff was really worried , and went to find Snape to ask . 
Sirius looked at the cave wall , frowning disappointed : 
It was true that Dumbledore believed Snape , and he knew that Dumbledore believed in a whole bunch of people who could not believe it , but if Snape had worked for Voldemort , he would not have understood why Dumbledore had given it . Mr. Snape teaches at Hogwarts . 
Ron still stubbornly questioned : 
Why did Moody and Mr. Crouch want Snape's room to work ? 
Sirius slowly answered : 
This , I do not exclude the eye - crazy teacher to review the work room of each teacher once he went to Hogwarts . 
Mr. Moody has done his Strict Anti - Art work strictly . 
I'm sure you do not trust anyone completely , but after what you have experienced , it's no wonder . 
However , about Moody , I must say he never killed anyone if he could avoid it . 
Always save people if they can save . 
Harsh , but never lowered his parity with Death Eaters . 
And Mr. Crouch is another story is he really sick ? 
If he was dead , why did he manage to break into Mr. Snape's office ? 
If not , what is he going to do ? 
How important was his work at the World Cup that he would not be sitting in the stands ? 
What did he do when he was supposed to be the referee for the match ? 
Sirius silent , eyes still staring at the cave wall . 
Buckbeak was crawling around on the stone floor , picking up the remaining bones . 
Finally , he looked up at Ron : 
Did you say your grandchildren as your own assistant Crouch ? 
So you can choose the time to ask if you recently saw Mr. Crouch ? 
Let me try . Ron replied , not sure . But do not let the picture tell you that Mr. Crouch is a dangerous guy . 
Percy loves him very much . 
Sirius points to the Daily Prophet , saying : 
And there you will find out if they find any trace of Mrs. Bertha Jorkins . 
Harry replied , 
Mr. Bagman told me they did not find anything . 
Sirius bowed to the newspaper , saying : 
Well , in this article I mentioned him . 
" It's a shame that Bertha's memory is bad . 
Well , since I've known her for a while now , maybe she has changed a little , but I know Bertha is not as ambitious as to forget something - otherwise . 
Although it is a little bit , but the gossip , she remembered no one . 
Trouble is that she always knows how to keep her mouth . 
I know she is a burden to the Ministry of Magmatism so that so far Mr. Bagman has not bothered to look for her . 
Sirius breathed a big loss , then rubbed his eyes dark circles : 
What time is it ? 
Harry watches the watch , then remembers the watch that has died since being soaked in water . 
It is three and a half hours . Said Hermione . 
Now they should go back to school . Sirius said as he stood up . Listen to the book . Look at Harry earnestly . 
I do not want to go out of school to visit him . 
I just sent a few letters here for you . 
He also wants to know if something strange . 
But do not go out of Hogwarts yourself , that's the ideal opportunity for someone to attack you . 
So far no one has attempted to attack me , except for a dragon and two sea monsters . 
Harry answered , but Sirius scowled with anger . 
There is no need to worry about the uncle just rest assured when the competition is over , but also to June . 
And remember when you talk to each other , call me Snuffles ( remember , Snitch ! ) Remember ? 
Sirius gave Harry the scarf that had run out of food and the hollow bottle was empty , then to Buckbeak , patted it bye . 
He said , 
I will go with the children to the village , to see if there are any newspapers to borrow . 
Before he got out of the cave , he turned into a giant black dog and went down the ridge , crossing a rocky cliff and returning to the mound . 
There , he allowed each of us to pat 
Head over to say goodbye , then turn away and run away on the road around the village . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione come back to Hogsmeade and go to Hogwarts . 
Said Ron as they were on their way to the castle : 
I wonder if Mr. Percy knows all about Mr. Crouch . 
But maybe the picture does not need to know it , sometimes it makes the image more admiration him . 
Yes , Mr. Percy enjoyed some of the rules . 
Sirius said that Mr. Crouch refused to take his hands with his son . 
Cried Hermione , 
Percy will never deliver any of his relatives to the dementors . 
Who knows . Ron answered . If you think you are hindering the progressive promotion of the British image of Percy , then it is quite ambitious that you know . 
They walked up the stone steps to the front door , listening to the delicious smell of the afternoon meal radiating from the hall . 
Poor industry Snape . Said Ron , breathing hard . He was so hurt , Harry Just imagine , to live with the rat 
CHAPTER 28 CHRISTMAS CROUCH 
Harry , Ron and Hermione climbed up to the Camp after a Sunday breakfast to send Percy a letter , as Sirius suggested , that Crouch had not seen recently . 
They use Hermione , because it's been quite a while since the last mail was delivered . 
Watching it fly out of the window outside the Trash , all of them dragging down the kitchen to give Dobby new socks . 
The elf welcomed them with great warmth , bending down and munching on one of them , whirring for tea . 
Dobby was so touched that he fainted when he saw the gift . 
Harry Potter is too good for Dobby ! 
He just shrieked as he wiped his tears from the huge eyes . 
Harry said : 
You saved your life with the grass of the fish , Dobby , you saved yourself . 
Ron looked around at the elves and crouched and beamed . 
She asked : 
Is that long cake still there ? 
Exclaimed Hermione : 
You eat breakfast ! 
But the four elves staggered to a large silver tray filled with cream cake . 
Harry whispered : 
We must take a bunch to send to Khat Khat . 
Italy or that . Said Ron . Give the pig something to do . 
Can you give us some more food ? 
The elves happily folded and rushed to get more . 
Dobby , where's Winky ? 
Asked Hermione , looking around . 
Dobby whispered , his ears slightly puffed : 
Winky is over there , by the fire , ma ' am . 
Hermione cried when she saw him . 
Oh man ! 
Harry also looked at the fireplace . 
Winky was sitting on the stool as before , but now he did not even look at himself , so he looked so indistinct that he could not distinguish it from the smoky brick wall behind him . 
Clothes Winky sticky and tattered . 
Grasping in the hands of a beer beaker , he sat on a chair and stared at the fireplace . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione looked at him , Winky hiccupped a big blow . 
Dobby whispered to Harry : 
Winky has six bottles a day . 
Harry said : 
But the butter is not that strong . 
But Dobby shook his head and said , 
Sir , that's a bit strong for an elf . 
Winky hiccups again . The goblin bobbins glance back at Winky who blushed and left to work . 
Potter knows , Winky is suffering . 
Dobby sadly whispered to Harry : 
Winky wants to go home . 
Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is his boss , and Dobby says it does not convince Winky that Dumbledore is now the owner of it . 
A thought flashed , Harry walked over to Winky , bending down to say , 
Winky , you know Mr. Crouch is busy talking about something , is not he ? 
Because he had stopped coming here to judge for the Magic Trial . 
Winky's eyes flashed . 
Her father's large eyebrows stared at Harry . 
She staggered a little and said : 
Does the boss not come here anymore ? 
Oh , we did not see him since the first round . The Prophet said that he was sick . 
Winky looked even more shocked , he stared at Harry , eyes blurry : 
The owner of the disease ? 
Its lower lip trembling : 
But we are not sure this is true . 
Said Hermione . 
The elf whimpered : 
The boss needs Winky ! 
The owner can not manage to manage his own life 
Said Hermione sternly : 
Many other people also have to do their own thing Winky . 
Winky is just doing housework for the boss ! 
Winky indignantly exclaimed , shrugging his shoulders , making the beer be bottled into the black shirt . 
The boss is trusting Winky .. the most important thing the most secret . 
Harry asked : 
What secret ? 
But Winky shakes his head , causing more butter to fall on him : 
Winky keeps the secret of the boss . 
Winky suddenly said aggressive , the more staggered , the two eyes grow up , fierce look Harry : 
You , you're in a hurry . 
Dobby said furiously : 
Winky did not say that to Harry Potter ! 
Harry Potter brave and noble does not bother to talk to others ! 
It is a private conversation and the secret of the owner Winky is a good guy Winky closed mouth people are trying to find out and intertwine the hicc 
Winky closed his eyes and suddenly , no one expected , he fell from the chair and fell into the fireplace , snoring . 
The cork rolls of bristled beef on the stone floor . 
Half a dozen elves rushed forward , looking at it with disgust . 
One picked up the bottle and the other picked up a large , clean table cover and winked at Winky , carefully cutting the edges , so no one could see it . 
An elf standing beside her shook her head and looked embarrassed , saying : 
We sincerely apologize for letting you ladies , you must see this scene ! 
We hope you ladies do not rate us as bad as Winky ! 
Hermione madly says : 
That's because Winky is suffering ! 
Why are not you trying to make Winky happy instead of her ? 
An ebony bent down low again and said : 
Ask her to give up , but the elf does not have the right to suffer when there is work to do and have the owner to serve . 
Cried Hermione : heaven and earth ! 
Dear friends , listen to me ! 
You also have the right sad as the witches ! 
You have the right to ask for wages , holidays and nice clothes , you are not obliged to do all the things that are wrong - let's follow Dobby ! 
Dobby murmured , panicked : 
Please do not mention Dobby . 
The happy smiles turned off the faces of the elves in the kitchen . They suddenly looked at Hermione as if she were crazy or a dangerous man . 
An elf standing close to his arm , Harry hissed . 
We give you girls more food ! 
Then he pressed Harry's arms in a fierce chute , a dozen pastries , a bunch of fruit . 
Goodbye ! 
The elves surrounded Harry , Ron , and Hermione , pushing their waist in their hands and chasing them out of the kitchen . 
Potter , thank you for the socks ! 
Dobby cried out from the fireplace . 
Next to it was the blanket of crooked Winky . 
Can not you keep your mouth shut , Hermione ? 
Ron said angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them . 
They do not want us coming anymore ! 
How can we meet Winky for more information about Mr. Crouch ! 
Hermione scoffed at it : 
Well , you do not care about that much ! 
You just want to go eat ! 
The next day was really annoying . 
In the living room , Ron and Hermione had just done their quizzes . 
Too tired with the two of them , so that evening , Harry alone brought food to the dregs to send Sirius . 
The little pig could not bring himself to his feet alone , so Harry took two more owls to help him . 
As they flew into darkness , carrying the big package , that scene looked awkward . 
Harry leaned over the window sill , looking out onto the school grounds , looking into the darkness , seeing the rustling trees in the Forbidden Forest , and the rolling flags waving in the wind of the Durmstrang . 
A large owl flew over the stream of smoke rising from Hagrid's hut chimney ; It soared up toward the castle , around the Dugout and lost . Suddenly down , Harry saw Hagrid digging hard in front of his hut . 
Looks like you're making a new garden . 
Suddenly he saw Maxime coming out of the Beauxbatons carriage and headed for Hagrid . 
She seems to want to talk to her . 
Uncle Hagrid leaned against the handle , but did not seem to want to prolong the story , because soon Maxime returned to the carriage . 
Not wanting to return to Gryffindor Tower to hear Ron and Hermione arguing , Harry watched Hagrid hoot until the darkness enveloped him and the owls around him woke up , flipping through and swirling in . the dark night . 
At breakfast the next day , the anger of both Ron and Hermione have dissipated . 
And Harry glares over at Ron's dark predictions that the elves would give Gryffindor poor quality food because Hermione had insulted them in the end , with bacon , eggs , and herring Absolutely delicious as before . 
As the owls arrived , Hermione looked eagerly , and she seemed to be waiting for something . 
Mr. Percy has not answered yet . Said Ron . We sent Hedwig yesterday . 
Not so right . Said Hermione . I just ordered the Proclamation for a long time . 
I'm tired of being so well known to the Slytherins . 
Insight ! 
Said Harry , looking up at the owls . 
Hey , Hermione , I think you're nuts 
A gray owl popped up toward Hermione . 
She looks disappointed : 
There is no newspaper , that is 
But before the bewilderment , her bewilderment , the gray owl at the plate , followed by four pigs , a brown owl , and a golden brown . 
Harry asked , holding Hermione's glass nearly knocked down by the owl . 
Did you order some newspapers ? 
The hulking clusters approached Hermione , trying to get the letter first . 
Said Hermione , taking the letter from the gray owl , opened it , and began to read . 
What the devil ? 
Oh really ! ... 
She stammered , her face flushed red . 
Asked Ron : 
What's going on ? 
Oh , it's ridiculous 
She gave Harry a letter . 
It's not a handwritten letter , but it's pasted with words - shaped like cut from the Prophet's Daily . 
You're a bad girl . 
You do not deserve Harry Potter . 
You go from Muggle to Muggle . 
Cried Hermione , hands open to leaf . 
That's all ! ' Harry Potter can make you better than you ' , ' You deserve to be boiled with a toad . ' 
Hermione opened her last envelope , a blue - green liquid that was yellowish and lustrous , sprayed with two hands , and then began to grow large yellowish pimples . 
Root of raw U pure ! 
Said Ron , picking up the bag , sniffing . 
Oh ! 
Cried Hermione as she tried to clean the pimples on her hands with a napkin , but now her fingers were thick with painful sores , just like wearing a pair of thick gloves . , scabrous . 
Get up and go to the hospital ! 
Harry said as the owls around Hermione flew away . 
We will ask Professor Sprout for you 
Ron said as Hermione rushed out of the hall , swinging her hands : 
I warned Hermione ! 
I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! 
Watch this ne 
Ron read one of the letters that Hermione left behind : 
I read on the Sorcerer's Week that she was fooling Harry and that the boy had also tasted so much hardship and that I was going to send her a curse in the mail delivery , Get a large envelope . ' Ồ ! At best , Hermione should be on guard for himself . 
Hermione did not return to herbal medicine . 
When Harry and Ron went out of the conservatory to attend Mystic Creature Care , they saw Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle walk down the stone steps of the castle . 
Pansy Parkinson was whispering a giggle to the Slytherins in her crew . 
When Harry saw him , Pansy said , 
Hey , Potter , you have not broken up with the boy ? 
Why is it so crowded at breakfast ? 
Harry ignored it ; She did not want her to know when the trouble with the article on the Fountain of Witches caused . 
Last time , Hagrid said they had finished learning the code . 
And now , he was waiting outside the hut , with bare wooden crates at his feet . 
Harry's throat tightened as he saw the barrels - sure there were not a bunch of other stingers out there ? - but when he was close enough to see the inside , Harry realized it was a smooth black creature with long muzzle . 
Their clawed frontal claws look oddly like the canvas , and they blink at the whole class , appearing courteously in front of all the attention they give . 
As the whole class gathered around , Hagrid said , 
These are the miners , which can be found mainly in warehouses . 
What a sparkling thing , the game looked away 
One of the miners jumped up and tried to bite Pansy Parkinson's wristwatch off her wrist . 
Pansy squealed and jumped back . 
Hagrid said cheerfully , 
These small animals find treasure very effective . 
Surely we will have fun with them tonight . 
Seeing over there ? 
Hagrid pointed at a large freshly cut lump at the stables where Harry had seen Hagrid hoe . 
He said , 
I buried some gold . 
And I have the reward for the game to pick the peach digging the most gold coins . 
Just take off all the accessories of the game , then choose a mine , then prepare to release it . 
Harry took his watch in his pocket ; The watch is dead , but it wears only because of habit . 
Then Harry picked up a minnow . 
The dugout snapped Harry's nose and sighed with great enthusiasm . 
It looks like it is cuddly . 
Hagrid looked down at the tree , saying , 
Do you have any left over ? 
Where is Hermione ? 
Ron replied : 
Yes , she must go sick sick . 
Harry whispered : 
We will explain later . 
Pansy is busy listening . 
It is undeniable that this is the happiest lesson they have ever learned about how to care for mysterious creatures . 
Trenches dive down and then rise up in the dirt , as if it were a puddle . 
Each uptake was rushed to the student selected and released it to release a gold student in his hands . 
Ron's dugout worked very energetically and effectively , and soon it was filled with gold on his thigh . Ron : 
When Ron's dugout pit came to the ground , Ron rubbed the ground on his lap and eagerly asked : 
Can we buy these pets as pets ? Hagrid ? 
Hagrid laughs : Your cheeks will not be happy , Ron . 
This minesweep will scour throughout the home for that . 
Hagrid went round the lap while the miners continued to crawl to the ground , adding : 
Now the mines have found most of the buried treasure . 
I only bury a golden moon . Look , Hermione ! 
Hermione was walking toward him , crossing the grass . 
Her hand was bandaged and she seemed very miserable . 
Pansy Parkinson squinted at Hermione . 
Said Hagrid . 
Well , let's take a look at the games . Count the gold coins that the game is offline ! 
Hagrid stared at his dark eyes , adding : 
But do not have the money , Goyle . These are the lunar coins , and after a few hours they disappear . 
Goyle poured out his pockets , his face swollen with all the talk . 
Eventually it turns out that Ron's minnow was the most successful , so Hagrid rewarded him with a large chunk of chocolate purchased from the Duke's shop . 
The bell rang across the school grounds , and the children rushed for lunch . 
The class drags to the castle , except Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
The three of them helped Hagrid trap their mines . 
Harry noticed that Maxime was watching them from the window of her carriage - house . 
Asked Hagrid , 
What's wrong with your hand , Hermione ? 
Hermione told Hagrid about the hateful letter she had received this morning , and about the envelope filled with Cu pus . 
Hagrid looked down at the girl and said gently : 
Well , do not worry . 
Uncle received a letter of that type after Rita Skeeter wrote article about his uncle . 
" You're a monster and you have to get rid of your necks , " " You're killing innocent people and if you have any shyness , you should jump into the lake ! 
Hermione looked alarmed : 
Really ? 
Elder Hagrid picked up the sparsely populated barrels of the old man's hut , and said , 
Why ? 
They are poisonous venom . 
You also receive the letter again , do not open it . 
Throwing them off the fire is complete . 
When the three returned to the castle , Harry said to Hermione , 
You miss a good lesson . 
Are the miners that mines too Ron ? 
Ron was frowning , however , for Hagrid's chocolate chip gave him credit . 
It looks like something just broke . 
Harry asked : 
Why Ron ? 
Does not taste good ? 
Ron whispered : 
Are not ! 
Why do not you tell me about gold coins ? 
Harry asked again . 
What gold ? 
Said Ron : 
The gold that I gave to the game in the Quidditch World Cup match . 
The gold coins that the darling dwarfs have come down and I have picked you up to pay for the multifunctional Magic Tube . On that honor stand . 
Why do not you tell me that they disappear ? 
Harry had to think for a moment to understand what Ron was talking about . 
Finally , as his memory returned , Harry said : 
Oh I do not know anymore I did not notice that they have disappeared . 
It was as if I was worried about my wand . They climbed up the stone steps to enter the Hall and went into the hall to eat lunch . 
As they sat down at the table and started to take their own homemade roast beef - Yorkshire , Ron suddenly said , 
To be happy . 
There is so much money that even a bag full of gold disappears without notice . 
Harry is no longer patient : 
Listen , that night my mind was on the other side . 
And all of us , remember ? 
Ron murmured : 
I do not know that the money will disappear . 
I thought I had paid off your debt . 
You should not have given yourself that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas . 
Harry said : 
Forget it , okay ? 
Ron sliced ​​ a piece of baked potato at his fork , staring at the potato . 
Then he said : 
I hate the poor . 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other . 
No one really knows what to say . 
Ron stared at his potato , continued : 
Damn it . 
I never blamed Fred and George for finding out more money . 
I can also . 
If you have a minnow . Said Hermione , 
So what do we know about Christmas ? But Ron still had a facial expression , Hermione said , 
Well , Ron , are you any more miserable than you ? 
At least your hands are not full of pits . 
She was in trouble because she had tossed her fork with her stiff and swollen fingers and it was so hard . Too bad , Hermione broke out violently : How could I hate this Skeeter ? 
I will make her pay this , even if it is the last thing I do in this life ! 
Hate continued to be sent to Hermione for a whole week , and although she listened to Hagrid's advice not to open the mail again , many of the villains sent Hermione a letter of thunder , and the letter exploded . as the thunder above Gryffindor's table and the insults squealed into the ears of the little girl so that the whole hall could hear . 
Even those who do not read the Witches Weekly are now aware of Harry's imaginary love story - Krum - Hermione . 
Harry was fed up with the misconception that Hermione was not his . 
He said to Hermione : Anyway , it's down . 
As long as I ignore it Last time people were tired of what she wrote about her 
Hermione said , 
I want to know how she hears private conversations when she is considered a forbidden door in the Hogwarts yard . 
After the next Black Sabbath school session , Hermione stayed behind to ask Professor Moody something . 
The remaining students are eager to leave the classroom ; Mr. Moody has given them a difficult test of how to steer the spell , causing many to have a bad start . 
Harry suffered from a bad case of an upset , causing his hands to clench his ear as he stepped out of the classroom . 
Five minutes later , Hermione gasped for Harry and Ron in the Hall , and she pulled Harry's hand away from one of her ears so that Harry could hear : 
Hey , Rita is definitely not using the Invisibility Cloak ! 
Moody says he did not see her anywhere near the examiner on the second exam , nor did she see where she was near the lake . Said Ron : 
Hermione , should I tell you to shut up this case ? 
Hermione stubbornly said : 
Are not ! 
I want to know how she heard her talk to Krum ! 
And how does she know about Hagrid's cheeks ? 
Harry said : 
Maybe she put a tape recorder on her . 
Ron's out : 
Eavesdropping ? Put your phone in Hermione or something ? 
Harry began to explain to Ron about the recording equipment and the secret recordings hidden somewhere . 
Ron listened to the narcotics , but Hermione interrupted their conversation : 
Did not you read Hogwarts , A History ? 
Said Ron : 
for what ? 
You have already laid your heart on , you just have to ask . 
All the magic alternatives that the Muggles use - like electricity , computers , and radar all of which are jammed in the Hogwarts campus , because in the air around the school there was too much magic . already . 
No , Rita must be using magic to eavesdrop , she is dare . If I find out that is a miracle , if the game is illegal , then she will know her hands . 
Ron asked Hermione , 
Do not you have enough problems to worry or not ? 
Do we need to initiate a lifelong grudge against Rita ? 
Cried Hermione , 
I do not ask for you ! 
I will do it alone ! 
She staggered up the marble staircase , without looking back once , Harry was sure she was going to the library . 
Said Ron : 
Fish ? 
I ' ll bet you ' ll come back with a box of badges I hate Rita Skeeter ! 
However , Hermione did not ask Ron or Harry to help me in their quest to take revenge on Rita Skeeter , and they gratefully thanked Hermione for this , because the closer they came to Easter , their assignments and their extra work piling up more and more . 
Harry admires Hermione so much that she can do all the sorcerer's saber - maneuvering studies , while still completing all the work that they have to do . 
It made a great effort to do all the exercises , though it also divided the mind of the time to send regular food packages to the mountain cave for Sirius . 
After the summer of last year , Harry had never forgotten what a feeling of constant hunger was . 
It was accompanied by letters to Sirius saying that nothing unusual had happened , and they were still waiting for Percy's reply . 
Until the end of the Easter Hedwig came back . 
Percy's letter was included in a package of Easter eggs sent by Mrs. Weasley to them . 
Both Harry and Ron received the big egg 
A dragon egg filled with honey made at home . 
But Hermione's egg was smaller than the egg . 
The face of the little girl when she saw her gift . 
The little girl asked : Did you happen to read the Witches Weekly ? 
Candy filled his mouth , Ron replied : 
There are chefs looking for recipes in those brochures . 
Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg . 
Harry asked Hermione , 
You do not want to see what Percy wrote ? 
Percy's letter is short and crisp : 
As you have often told the Prophet , that Mr. Crouch is well deservedly rested . 
He still sends the directions to the office on a regular basis . 
No , actually , he did not see him , but he thought he was absolutely convinced that he could recognize his chief's handwriting . 
At this point he had enough work to do without the need to add a correction to the funny rumors . 
Please do not bother him unless that is really important . 
Have a good Easter . 
If the beginning of the summer semester that normally occurs , it means that Harry has to practice hard for the final Quidditch match of the season . 
However , this year , the match that needed to be re - prepared was her maiden test and also the final test of the Trilogy Tour . 
But it still does not know what it will do . 
Finally , in the last week of May , Professor McGonagall held Harry again after the Transfiguration School . 
She told Harry : 
I will go down to the Quidditch field at nine o ' clock tonight , Potter . 
Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the contestants about the third test . 
Out at eight - thirty that evening , Harry left Hermione and Ron to stay on Gryffindor Tower , alone down the stairs . 
As it passed through the Hall , Cerdic came out of the common room of the Hufflepuff . 
Two children go together down the stone steps , out into the night clouds . 
Cerdic asks Harry : 
What do you think of the upcoming exam ? Fleur kept talking about underground tunnels , she guessed we would go find treasure . 
Harry said : 
If that is not so hard . 
He was thinking it was just a matter of borrowing a hagrid from Hagrid to replace his job of finding the treasure . 
They went down to the grass to get to Quidditch Stadium , turned into an empty spot between the stands , and went to the grass . 
Cerdic stood silent and indignant : 
What did they do ? 
Quidditch football is no longer smooth . 
It looks like someone has built up low and long walls all over the stadium , the walls are zigzagged in all directions and cut off each other . 
Harry leaned down and looked at the wall closest to it , saying , 
Fence with shrubs . 
An excited voice rang : 
Hello ! 
Ludo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur . 
Harry and Cerdic make their way to the other three by climbing through the hedges . 
Fleur smiled at Harry as he approached . 
Fleur's attitude toward Harry has changed radically since Harry rescued Fleur's sister under the lake . 
Mr. Bagman said happily as Harry and Cerdic climbed over the last hug : 
What do you think ? 
Do these hawks grow so well ? It would take about a month for Hagrid to make them grow six feet tall . 
Seeing Cerdic's and Harry's cheerful face , Mr. Bagman grinned , adding : 
do not worry ! 
Your Quidditch Stadium will return to normal once the test is over ! 
Now let me guess what will we do here ? 
For a while , no one answered . 
Then Krum grumbled : 
Maze . 
Mr. Bagman said : 
That's right ! 
A maze . 
The third test is very clear . 
The Magic Triangle will be located at the center of the maze . 
Champions who hit the first trophy will get the full score . 
Fleur asked : 
Do you need to cross the Mesa ? 
Mr. Bagman said happily : 
There will be obstacles . 
Mr. Hagrid will release some creatures and have some spells to clear them out , something like that . 
Now , the champions are leading points will open the entrance to the maze . 
Mr. Bagman grinned at Harry and Cerdic , continued : 
Krum then goes to Miss Delacour . 
All will be equal , but the win is based on how the game over obstacles . 
Is it really fun ? 
Harry knew very well that the kind of creatures Hagrid seemed to provide for a contest like this , so he thought it was fun to be happy . 
However , it also nods like other champions . 
Very good if the contestants have no other questions , we will walk back to the castle , it's a bit cold 
Mr. Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to walk through the maze . 
Harry felt that Mr. Bagman was about to offer it again , but at that moment , Krum slapped Harry on the shoulder : 
Can I tell you something ? 
Harry is a little surprised : 
Oh , okay . 
Do you walk with me ? 
Curious curiosity : 
OK . 
Mr. Bagman looked a little worried : 
I'm waiting for you , Harry ? 
Harry tried to smile : 
Yes , Mr. Bagman , no need . 
I think you can find your way back to the castle , thank you . 
Harry and Krum leave the stadium together , but Krum is not heading for the Durmstrang . 
So he went to the forest . 
As the two passed by Hagrid's hut and the Beauxbatons rolling car also lit the lights , Harry whispered : 
What are we going to do in this direction ? 
Krum said , 
No eavesdropping . 
Finally , as they reached a quiet courtyard spread out , not far from the beauxbatons ' horse fields , Krum stopped under a tree and turned back to face Harry . 
He glared at Harry , 
I know between Herm - own - ninny and he has a pass ? 
Due to Krum's secretive behavior , Harry thought that something was more serious than this , and he looked at Krum with pleasure . 
It says : 
Nothing at all . 
But Krum kept staring at him , and for some reason he suddenly realized how tall Krum was . 
Harry added , 
We are friends . 
Hermione is not my friend and Hermione is not my friend at all . 
It was only Rita who set up . 
Krum looked suspiciously at Harry : 
Herm - own - ninny talk about him very much . Harry said : 
Oh , because we're friends . 
Harry could not believe that one day there was such a dialogue with Viktor Krum , the world famous Quidditch player . 
It seems the eighteen - year - old hero Krum considers it , Harry , as a real and equal competitor . 
You're not the only one 
Harry said firmly : 
Are not . 
Krum looked slightly happy . 
He stared at Harry for a few seconds and said , 
You fly so well . 
I sat on the first test . 
Harry grinned to his ear and suddenly saw his spirit rising higher . 
Thank you . 
I watched him in the World Quidditch Cup . 
The trick that you play is 
But there is something moving behind Krum's back , in the trees , and Harry , who has had the bloody experience of stalking the forest , should react instinctively , grabbing Krum's arm and dragging him . I returned . 
What's up ? 
Harry shook his head , staring at the spot he had seen moving . 
He put his hand in his pocket and grabbed the wand . 
Suddenly , a man staggers out from behind a tall oak tree . 
Harry did not believe in his own eyes for a moment but then realized that it was Mr. Crouch . 
He seemed to tread as if he had to run here for many days . 
The knee of the shirt he was wearing was torn and bloodied , his face was scratched ; The whiskers do not shave , and he's grayed out because of exhaustion . 
The cleanly trimmed hair and mustache now needs to be brushed and cleaned 
recapitulate 
However , his strange appearance is not strange in his behavior . 
With his hands on his feet , as he spoke , it seemed that Crouch was talking to someone that only he could see . 
He reminded Harry clearly of a wandering vagabond he once had seen when he and his family went shopping in Muggle Street . 
The old man is also comfortable talking to the air . 
Aunt Petunia grabbed Dursley's arm and dragged him across the street to avoid him ; And Uncle Vernon had told the whole family about what he wanted to do to the bum and wanderers . 
Krum rolled his eyes at Mr. Crouch : 
Is he a judge ? 
Not your minister ? 
Harry nodded , hesitating for a moment , then slowly walked towards Mr. Crouch , who did not look at Harry , but kept talking to the nearby tree : and when he finished , Mr. Weatherby , Dumbledore confirmed that the number of Durmstrang students attending the competition , Karkaroff said only twelve 
Harry scoffed : 
Mr. Crouch ? and then sent another to Mrs. Maxime , because maybe she wanted to increase the number of students in her delegation , when Mr. Karkaroff's team did a dozen rounds to do that , Weatherby , do not you ? 
Are you listening ? ... 
Crouch's eyes widen . 
He peered up at the tree trunk , muttered speechless with it . 
Then he staggered aside and collapsed , and Harry cried out : 
Mr. Crouch ? 
Are you okay ? 
Mr Crouch's eyes widened . 
Harry looked over at Krum , who had followed Harry in the bushes and looked down at Crouch in a panic manner . 
What was he doing ? 
Harry murmured : 
Can not know . 
Please help find someone to help 
Dumbledore ! 
Mr. Crouch cried out . 
He grasped Harry's lap , pulling it closer to him , though his eyes stared up at Harry's head . 
I need to meet Dumbledore 
Harry said : 
Yes . 
Mr. Crouch , if you can stand up , we can go 
Mr Crouch whispered : 
I did something stupid 
He looks extremely crazy . 
His eyes fluttered around and almost convexed . 
A saliva flow down to the chin . 
Every word he said seemed like a great effort . 
To say ... to Dumbledore . 
Harry said loudly : 
Mr. Crouch , get up . 
He got up and went to meet Dumbledore . 
Mr Crouch's eyes widened , toward Harry . 
He whispered , 
Who are you ? 
Harry said : 
You are a Hogwarts student . 
She looked at Krum for help , but Krum stepped back , frightened , anxious . 
Mr. Crouch whispered , his mouth deflected one side : 
Are not you guys ? 
Harry had no idea what Crouch was saying . 
It says : 
No . 
Dumbledore's man ? 
Harry replied , 
Yes . 
Mr. Crouch pulled Harry closer ; Harry tried to loosen Mr Crouch's hand , but he clutched it tight . 
Tell Dumbledore 
Harry said : 
If you let go , I ' ll run to invite Dumbledore . 
Let go , I will go find you 
Thanks , Mr. Weatherby , and when you finish that , give me a cup of tea . 
My wife and son are coming , we will attend a concert tonight with the Fudge grandparents . 
Now Crouch spoke fluently to the tree , and seemed completely unaware that Harry was standing there . This made Harry so startled that it was not even Crouch's release . 
My son has just achieved twelve OWLs , very well , yes , thank you grandparents , yes , it is very honorable . 
Now if you can bring me the minutes of the meeting with Minister of Magic Andorran , I have some time to draft a reply letter . 
Harry told Krum : 
You stay here and watch him ! 
I will run to Dumbledore , I will go faster , because I know where the teacher's office . 
Krum looked down at Mr. Crouch : 
He is crazy 
Mr. Crouch continued to babble at the tree , obviously he was Percy . 
Harry stood up and said , 
You just need to be here with him . 
But Harry's movements triggered a sudden change in Mr. Crouch . 
He grabbed his knee and pulled it down . 
He whispered , his eyes bulging again : 
do not leave me ! 
I escaped must say must meet my Dumbledore all my fault is my fault Bertha died at fault my son died at me told Dumbledore Harry Potter Dark Lord stronger than Harry Potter 
Harry said : 
Mr. Crouch , you let go , you go to find Dumbledore 
Looking back at Krum , Harry said , 
Can you help me ? 
Facing Krum , who was terrified , he stepped forward and squat down beside Mr. Crouch . 
Harry pulls himself out of Crouch's grasping hand , telling Krum : 
Just keep him here . 
I will return to Dumbledore . 
Back to listen ! 
Krum called after Harry as he ran out of the forest and crossed the school grounds . 
All around are deserted ; Mr. Bagman , Fleur , Cerdic have all disappeared . 
Harry ran up the stone steps , through the oak front door , running up the marble stairs , toward the second floor . 
Five minutes later , Harry slammed into a stone - tipped gutter mouth lying in the middle of a deserted corridor . 
He gasped : 
Candy lime candy ! 
That is the password for the secret staircase leading up to the principal's office - or perhaps it was a password two years ago . 
But apparently the password has changed , because the stone animal's head just stood there staring at Harry maliciously , not animating and jumping aside as before . 
Harry screamed at the stone : 
Get out ! 
Open up ! 
But at Hogwarts there was nothing to move just because someone yelled at her . 
Harry knew that was futile . 
He looked up and down the corridor . 
Could Dumbledore be in the professor's office ? 
He began to push his neck down the stairs 
POTTER ! 
Harry stopped and looked back . 
Mr. Snape has just emerged from the mysterious stairs behind the stone head . 
The wall was closed behind the teacher's back when he called Harry back : 
What are you doing here , Potter ? 
Harry ran back up the corridor , pausing again , but this time in front of Snape . 
You need to meet Professor Dumbledore ! 
About Mr. Crouch , he was in the forest asking him 
Snape's eyes widened : 
Talk about the range ! 
What are you talking about ? 
Harry shouted : 
Mr. Crouch ! 
Minister ! 
He's sick or he's in the forest , he wants to see Dumbledore ! 
Please give me the password to 
Snape's throat curled up into an uncomfortable smile : 
Dumbledore is busy , Potter . 
Harry screamed : 
You must see Dumbledore . 
Did you hear me , Potter ? 
Harry could tell that Snape was delighted to have denied Harry what he was eagerly wanted in this panic . 
Harry said , 
Do you understand ? 
Mr. Crouch was not healthy and he said he wanted to warn 
The stone wall behind Mr. Snape's back opened . 
Dumbledore stood right there , wearing a blue dress and a curious look . 
He looked at Harry and Snape and asked : 
What's up ? 
Harry stepped aside to avoid Snape and snatched his lips before Snape could speak . 
Sir ! 
Mr. Crouch is here in the woods , he wants to talk to you . 
Harry thought Dumbledore would question him , but he could not help wondering what he was up to . 
He said : 
I lead the way . 
And Harry followed Harry by the corridor , leaving Snape standing beside the rocky head , looking ugly twice . 
As two teachers ran down the marble stairs , Dumbledore asked , 
What did Crouch say , Harry ? 
Tell him he wants to tell you to tell him to do something wrong about his son and Bertha Jorkins and Voldemort saying something about Voldemort getting stronger . 
That's it ! 
Dumbledore said , the pace was quicker as both teachers rushed into the darkness like a knot . 
Harry ran to Dumbledore and said , 
He acted abnormally . 
He does not seem to know where he is . 
He talked as if he thought Percy Weasley was there , and suddenly he changed his voice , saying he needed to see his son to stay with Krum . 
Did you do that ? 
Dumbledore spoke quickly , and he accelerated , striding faster , making Harry run faster . 
Do you know anyone else seeing Mr. Crouch ? 
Harry said : 
Yes , no . 
I'm with Krum talking . 
Mr. Bagman told us about the third test , we stayed , and then we saw Mr. Crouch coming from the forest . 
As the Beauxbatons wagon emerges from the darkness , Dumbledore asks : 
Where are they ? 
Harry reached out to Dumbledore one step , leading the way through the woods : 
Over there . 
Harry did not hear Crouch's voice anymore , but he knew for certain which step he should take . 
It is not far from the Beauxbatons carriages around here 
Harry shouted : 
Brother Viktor ? 
No answer . 
Harry told Dumbledore : 
They were here earlier . 
They must be somewhere 
Lumos ! 
Dumbledore lighted the wand's head and now it's up . 
The narrow beam of light wanded through the black tree to another black tree , glowing dimly to the ground . 
Then the light shines on a pair of legs . 
Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward . 
Krum was lying on the ground , apparently not knowing anything . 
Not see the figure of Mr. Crouch . 
Dumbledore bent down to Krum and gently brushed his eyes . Little talk : 
Fainting . 
Dumbledore's moonlight glinted in the light of his wand as he looked at the surrounding trees . 
Harry said : 
Should I go to the emergency room ? 
Are you going to ask Mrs. Pomfrey ? 
Dumbledore said right away : 
Are not . 
I stay here . 
He raised his wand , pointing his wand at Hagrid's hut . 
Harry saw something like a silver ray flashing out of his wand and flying through the trees like a ghost . 
Finished , Dumbledore bent down to look at Krum again . 
He pointed his wand at Krum and shouted : 
Ennervate ! 
Krum opened his eyes . 
You look foolish . 
When he saw Dumbledore , Krum tried to sit up , but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder to make him lie still . 
Krum raised a hand to his head , murmuring : 
He hit me . 
That crazy man hit me . 
I watched as Potter went away and he attacked me from behind . 
Dumbledore said : 
You lie still for a moment . 
The sound of footsteps rumbled , and Hagrid sighed and drove along with Fang running close to his feet . 
Eyes wide open , he asked : 
Dear Professor Dumbledore ! 
Harry what ? ... 
Dumbledore said : 
Hagrid , I need you to find Professor Karkaroff . 
His students were attacked . 
And when he finished that , he warned Professor Moody . 
A whispered voice said , 
No need , Dumbledore . 
I came here . 
Mr. Moody was limping toward them , leaning against the stick and looking at the light of the wand . 
Moody said , 
Legs with legs ! 
Would they be a bit faster ? 
What happened ? 
I heard Mr. Snape say something about Mr. Crouch 
Hagrid was bewildered : 
Mr. Crouch ? 
Dumbledore recalls : 
Hagrid , please come to Mr. Karkaroff . 
Oh , yes , Professor 
Said Hagrid , turning away , disappearing into the darkness of the tree , Fang hurried to follow him . 
Dumbledore told Moody : 
I do not know where Mr. Crouch is ? 
But we need to find him . 
let me do it . 
Mr. Moody pulled out the wand and limped into the forest . 
Both Dumbledore and Harry did not say anything until they heard the unmistakable sound of Hagrid and dog Fang . Behind them was Mr. Karkaroff hurriedly followed . 
He was dressed in a shiny silver coat and pale . 
He screamed when he saw Krum lying on the ground and Dumbledore and Harry were at his side . 
What is this ? 
What happened ? 
Krum sat up and rubbed his head : 
I was in a hurry . 
Mr. Crouch or something 
Mr Crouch attacked the game ? Mr Crouch attacked the game ? 
He is the referee of the Magic Trial Competition ! 
Dumbledore said : 
Brother Igor 
But Mr. Karkaroff stood up straight , pulling his coat around him , looking over his shoulder . 
He pointed at Dumbledore , shouting : 
trick filter ! This is a plot ! 
Mr. Dumbledore , you and your Ministry of Magic have lured us here under false pretenses ! This is not a fair game ! 
First , he sought to take Harry Potter in spite of his age . 
Now one of his ministers attacked our kind of champion . 
I smell in the air the mistranslation and corruption of this whole drama , and you , Mr. Dumbledore , keep talking about tightening international mastership , re - establishing old relationships , That forgets the difference so far , this is what I thought of you ! 
Mr. Karkaroff plucked a dump into Dumbledore's leg . 
In a very fast reaction , Hagrid grabbed Karkaroff's fur collar , lifted him up in the air , and hurled him at a nearby tree . 
Mr. Karkaroff just breathed his breath , Hagrid snarled : 
Sorry now ! 
Hagrid's great fist pitted against Karkaroff's chest and his legs swung in the air . 
Dumbledore said , 
Hagrid , do not ! 
Hagrid collected Karkaroff's hand from the tree , and Mr. Karkaroff slid under the tree , piling it under a tree . 
A bunch of twigs and leaves fell on his head . 
Dumbledore whispered : 
Hagrid , please take Harry back to the castle . 
Hagrid sighed , glaring at Karkaroff with a glare . 
Dear principal , maybe I stay here better 
Dumbledore repeated firmly : 
I ' ll take Harry back to school , Hagrid . Bring it up to the Gryffindor Tower . 
And Harry , I want you to stay in the tower . 
Anything I want to do - no matter which owl you want to send - will have to wait until the next morning , do you understand me ? 
Oh , understand 
Said Harry , staring at Dumbledore . 
How do you know , right at the moment , that he was thinking of sending Sirius the piglet , telling him what had happened . 
Mr. Hagrid glared at Karkaroff without regret , he said , 
Dear principal , I will let Fang stay with you . 
Mr. Karkaroff is now lying under the tree in a pile of fur and branches of tree roots . 
Stay here listening to Fang ! Let's go , Harry ! 
The two of us quietly walked past the Beauxbatons carriage and headed for the castle . 
As he strode across the lake , Hagrid roared : 
How dare he ! 
Why did he dare Dumbledore ? 
Like Dumbledore who craves for such things ! 
As Dumbledore wants her to attend the competition right from the start . 
Think of nonsense ! 
Unlike Dumbledore , Dumbledore has never been so nervous . 
And you ! 
Hagrid suddenly raged with Harry . 
He looked up at him . 
What do you do ? Hang on with that damn Krum guy ! 
It's from Durmstrang , Harry ! 
He can take you in the forest ! 
Could not Moody teach you something ? 
Imagine your child letting him seduce you and your child 
When two of them climbed up the steps , Harry said , 
Mr. Krum is fine . 
I do not intend to do anything , I just want to talk to her about Hermione 
Hagrid stumbled up the stairs , murmuring , 
He will talk to Hermione and finish it . 
The less you have sex with the foreigners , the happier you are . Do not trust anyone in that group . 
Harry was annoyed : 
Before you are still very good with Mrs. Maxime ! 
For a moment , Hagrid seemed to panic : 
You never tell me about her again ! 
Now you know her scheme ! 
She tried to get her doctor's attention , trying to get her to tell her what was going to happen on the third test . 
Well , you do not have to trust anyone in that group . 
Hagrid was in such a bad mood that when Harry bid him goodbye in front of Mrs. Beaux's portrait , he felt very happy . 
He climbed through the portrait hole to enter the common room and rushed straight to the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting , telling them what had happened . 
Chapter 29 DREAMS 
Hermione rubbed her forehead and said , " It's the same thing : either Crouch attacked Viktor , or else attacked them both when Viktor did not see him . " 
Said Ron : 
It must have been Mr. Crouch . 
So he disappeared when Harry and Dumbledore returned . You have to run ! 
Harry shook his head : 
I do not think so . 
He looks very weak . 
I'm not sure that he can perform any territorial or magical work . 
" How many times have I told you , " said Hermione , " that I can not litter in the Hogwarts yard ! " 
Ron excitedly : 
Okay , what about this theory ? 
Krum attacked Mr. Crouch .. drilling , waiting to finish talking and then self - unconscious ? 
And Mr. Crouch evaporated , did not he ? 
Oh yes 
The next day , Harry , Ron and Hermione sneaked out of their bedroom very early and rushed to the cage together to send a letter to Sirius . 
Now they were looking out at the misty schoolyard . 
The three of them were pale and pale as they stayed up late into the night to talk about Mr. Crouch . 
Hermione said : 
Harry , you told me , what did Crouch actually say ? 
Harry said : 
I told you , what he said is not very meaningful . 
He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore something . 
He certainly mentioned Bertha Jorkins , and seemed to think she was dead . 
He kept repeating the mistake of his brother also mentioned his son . 
Hermione grumbled : 
So , what's wrong with him ? 
Harry said : 
He is insane . 
Half the time he was talking as if he thought he and his wife were still alive , and he told Percy about the job and directed the picture . 
Ron hesitated : 
And reminded me of what he said about Who - Who - Know - Who - Who ? 
Harry eagerly said : I told you , he is getting stronger . 
Quiet . 
Then Ron said with a fake confidence : 
But he is insane , as you say , into what he said half sure things are not so 
Harry said : 
He seemed to be most alert when he tried to talk to Voldemort . 
Ron looked up at the name Harry had just blurted out . 
He was having a real hard time saying the words , but it was when he seemed to know where he was , and knew what he was doing . 
He said he needed to meet Dumbledore . 
Harry left the window and began to look up at the parallel bars that held the roof of the owl . 
The beaks are almost half empty ; Occasionally an owl flies through a window into his parking lot , returning from a night drive with a rat in the mine . 
Harry bitterly said : 
If Snape did not hold his foot , we and Dumbledore would have been able to get there in time . 
Now , ' the principal is busy , Potter ' , what's the deal ? ' Why can not he stay out of the job ? 
Ron replied : 
Maybe he did not want to let you go ! 
Maybe , well ? ... 
Do you think he can get to the forest quickly ? 
Did you count on him and Dumbledore ? 
Harry said : 
No way , unless he turns into a bat or something like that . 
Ron murmured : 
You can not ignore it . 
Hermione said : 
We must go to see Moody . 
We need to see if you find out Mr. Crouch ? 
Harry said : 
If you bring a map of the pirate , it will be easy to find . 
Said Ron : 
If Mr Crouch has not left the school grounds , because the map only shows people inside the curb . 
Hermione said softly . 
Shit ! 
Somebody is climbing the stairs to the Cage . 
Harry could hear the two of them quarreling , closer and closer . 
That's a blackmail , yes , we're going to have a lot of trouble with that 
We were polite ; It's time to play , like him . 
He did not want the Ministry to know what he did 
I'm telling you that if you write it in a letter it will be a blackmail . 
Well , as long as we get paid a lucrative , you will not complain anymore ? 
The door to the open cage opened . 
Fred and George cross the threshold and stand in front of Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
Ron and Fred say for a moment : 
What are you doing here ? 
What are you doing here ? 
Harry and George both replied , 
Mailing . 
Hermione and Fred asked again : 
What , this time ? 
Fred grinned . 
It says : 
Good , we will not ask you what to do , if we do not ask you now . 
Fred was holding a sealed letter in his hand . 
Harry glances at the letter , but Fred , accidentally or accidentally , returns the letter to another , causing the recipient's name on the envelope to be hidden . 
Fred made a gesture of bowing to the blasphemers and pointed to the door : 
Well , do not dare to hold our feet for a long time . 
Ron did not budge . 
He asked : 
Who are you going to blackmail ? 
The smile disappeared on Fred's face . 
Harry noticed George half - glancing at Fred before smiling at Ron . 
He said easily : 
Do not be stupid , just say play only . 
Said Ron : 
Listen not at all . 
Fred and George looked at each other . 
Then Fred said , 
I told you before , Ron , do not talk to other people if you want the nose to keep its shape . 
Do not know why you are 
Said Ron : 
If you send someone blackmail , then you will be in the nose . 
George is right , he will face a lot of trouble because of that to see . 
George says : 
I told you I was joking . 
George went to Fred , snatched the letter out of Fred's hands , and started to tie up the letterless foot of a pig owl , saying , 
You started to smell the smell of our beloved brother , Ron , 
Keep that voice will be the day you become the leader . 
Ron is hot : 
No way ! 
George took the owl to the window and threw it out , then turned back and grinned at Ron . 
If so , then the hottest thing for people to do this with the other . 
Well , see you again ! 
George and Fred left the owl . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione looked at each other . 
Hermione whispered : 
Do you think they know anything about all this ? 
The story of Mr. Crouch and other things ? 
Harry said : 
Are not . 
If it is so serious then some pictures will tell someone . 
The pictures will tell Dumbledore know ! 
But Ron looked so restless . 
Hermione asked : 
What's up ? 
Ron said slowly : 
Well , I do not know if some photos are worth it . 
Recently , the two photos were a little obsessed with money , I noticed this when I was hanging around with some photos at 
When we stopped playing together . 
Harry finishes the sentence for Ron , and continues : 
Oh , but the blackmail thing 
Said Ron : 
Not two pictures came up with the idea of ​​ opening a shop . 
I thought two pictures just said to provoke my cheek for fun , but two photos do damage , want to start a new one . 
The two of them had just been studying at Hogwarts for a year , the two kept telling themselves it was time to think about the future , and three could not help the two , and the two needed gold to build the store . . 
Hermione was nervous now : 
Oh , but they probably do not do anything illegal rules to get gold . 
Ron is suspicious : 
Who knows ? 
I'm not sure The two images are not afraid of what the rules violation , right ? 
Hermione looks frightened to where : 
Oh , but this is the law . This is not going to violate some of the school rules . If they blackmail them , they would have worse consequences than the banning Ron , maybe you should go to Percy . 
Said Ron : 
Crazy crazy 
Mr. Percy ? 
Dare to become a Mr. Crouch and bring two photos submitted to prison . 
Ron stared at the window frame where Fred and George's owls flew . 
Then he said : 
Come on , let's have breakfast ! 
As they climbed down the spiral staircase , Hermione said , 
Do not you see that now to see Mr. Moody is too early ? 
Harry said : 
Yes . 
In the early morning so that to wake up teacher is very likely he rushed out of the door immediately . 
He would think we were going to attack him while he was sleeping . 
Let's wait till the time to play . 
The history of magic has never been so slow . 
Harry kept looking at Ron's watch , for he finally threw his broken watch away . 
But Ron's watch was so slow that Harry dared to stop the watch . 
The three children are so tired that they are put down on the table and sleep is also happy . 
Even Hermione did not take notes as always , but rested her head on her hand , gazing at Professor Binns with dreamy eyes . 
Finally , when the bell rang , they hurried back up the corridor to the Anti - Art Room and saw Professor Moody go out of the classroom . 
The teacher is tired as well as they are . 
Eyeliner's normal eye drops , making the teacher's face more distorted . 
As they pushed past the crowd to come near him , Harry called : 
Dear Professor Moody ? 
Professor Moody is grateful : 
Hello Potter . 
The magician's eyes watched the first two students pass by , and they looked worried . 
Then the eye turned to look at the other two in the turn , then to say : 
Come in . 
He stepped back to let the three of them walk into the empty room , then limped along with them . 
After closing the door . 
Harry asked without preamble : 
Can you find him , Mr. Crouch ? 
Mr. Moody says ; 
Are not . 
He went to the desk and sat down , stretched out his wooden legs with a slight moan , then pulled the water bottle to his side . 
Harry asked : 
Did you use the map ? Mr. Moody took a sip from the beige , saying , 
Of course . 
You imitated me , Potter . 
Use the magic charms to summon it from the master's office in the forest . 
But he did not see him . 
Said Ron : 
So he landed ? 
Hermione said : 
Ron ! 
People can not land on campus ! 
Could he have other ways to disappear without his teacher ? 
Moody's magical eye shook as he looked at Hermione . 
He told her : 
You are another student who can think of becoming a Spirit that later . Your mind is very clear , Granger . 
Hermione flushed for joy . 
Harry said : 
But why not see ? 
The map shows the invisible people . 
So he was out of the school grounds . 
Hermione said eagerly . 
Was it his own strength ? 
Has anyone else taken him ? 
Oh , right . 
Someone might have pulled him up on a broomstick and carried him away , could he ? 
Ron said impatiently , looking at Mr. Moody as if he wanted to be reminded that he also had the prospect of becoming a future god . 
Mr. Moody is just a bust : 
We can not rule out the possibility of kidnapping . 
Said Ron : 
Do you consider that he is in the village of Hogsmeade ? 
Moody shook his head . 
He may be anywhere . The only thing we know for sure is he's not here . 
Then he yawned a great deal , so that his scars filled his face , and his distorted mouth revealed some swollen teeth . 
Finished , he said : 
Listen , Dumbledore told me that the three of them had made themselves a detective , but you could not do anything for Mr. Crouch . 
Right now the Ministry is looking for him , Dumbledore has told them the facts . 
Potter , please pay attention to my third exam . 
Harry said : 
What test ? 
Yes 
Since Harry and Krum left the maze last night until now , he had not thought a bit about the test he was about to take . 
Mr. Moody looked up at Harry and scratched his scarred chin : 
This exam scratches the right of that child . 
Like what Dumbledore told you , you managed to get past that many times . 
In the first year you have opened the way to overcome a series of obstacles guarding the witch stone , right ? 
Ron quickly said , 
Thanks for helping us . 
Hermione and I helped Harry 
Moody grinned : 
Please help Harry practice this test , you will be surprised if Harry does not win it ! At the same time Vigilant listening to Potter ! 
Regular vigilance ! 
Mr. Moody came back from a crock pot from his master , his magician's eye curled out the window . 
From this window you can see the highest peak of the Durmstrang mast . 
Moody's normal eye looked at Ron and Hermione , who discussed with them : 
Two children , you two follow Potter , okay ? 
He keeps an eye on everything , but at the same time the vigilance is never over . 
The next morning , Sirius sent the owl back to them immediately . 
Their owl patted their wings and landed with Harry at the same time with a brown owl sitting in front of Hermione's face , clutching a Prologue in the mine . 
Hermione took the newspaper , flipped through the pages , and said , 
Ha ! 
She has not sniffed Mr. Crouch ! 
Then Hermione took a head with Harry and Ron read Sirius's letter to see what he had to say about the mysterious events that happened the night before : 
Harry , do you think I'm playing a game , but are you going to walk with Viktor Krum in the woods ? 
I want you to swear with me , with a reply , from now on I will never walk with anyone else at night . There is someone at the Hog warts school extremely dangerous . 
It was clear that he wanted to prevent Mr. Crouch from meeting with Du mbledore , and perhaps he had just walked a few feet away in the dark . 
I could almost have been killed ! 
Your name does not accidentally fall into the glass . 
If someone tries to attack me , this is his last chance . 
Always stay with Hermione and Ron , never leave the Gryffindor Tower at night , and be prepared for your own third exam . 
Practice the enchanting spell and the enchantment spell . 
Adding some of the gods is not so crap . 
As for Mr. Crouch , I can not do anything about it . 
Relax yourself and take care of yourself first . 
Waiting for the letter I promised you would not go out on the street . 
Sirius . 
Harry folded the letter back , slipped into his sack , and said in a sulky voice : 
In the past , he had done all sorts of things at school , now he is back to his class to not be out of school , who is he ? 
Hermione said : 
He's worried about you ! 
Just like Moody and Hagrid ! 
Then you should listen to them . 
Harry said : 
All year long , no one tried to harm me . 
None of us do anything 
Hermione said : 
Except for leaving your name in the Goblet . 
They do so with the intention . Harry . 
Snape said that right . 
Maybe they are waiting for a good opportunity . 
Maybe they will get rid of you . Harry loses patience : Baby , let's just assume Sirius is right , and someone knocked Mr. Krum out and got Mr. Crouch . 
Oh , he must be right in the woods near one side , right ? 
But he waited until he ran away from that place before he acted , right ? Then I do not seem to be aiming at that target , right ? 
Hermione said : 
If they kill you in the forest , they can hardly pretend to be an accident ! 
But if you die in doing a test 
Harry said : 
Are not they concerned about harming Mr. Krum ? 
Why do not they just let go ? 
They can staged as they did and Krum dueled or something like that 
Hermione said desperately : 
Harry , I do not understand . 
I just know that there are so many strange things going on , and I do not want Brother Moody to say Sirius is right . You need to concentrate on your third exam , right now . 
And you must have written Sirius's letter and promised that you would never sneak out again . 
Hogwarts School never looked so attractive at the time when Harry was forced to stay in the castle . 
For the next few days , Harry spent all his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron to study the spell , or in an empty classroom that they sneaked into . episodes . 
Harry is focusing on the Stupidity , something he has never used before . 
The trouble is that practicing this charm requires some sacrifice on Hermione and Ron . 
At lunch on Monday , Ron suggested : 
Or did we kidnap Mrs. Noris ? 
He lay on his back in the middle of the study room . He was spellbound because Harry had been spellbound and had been spotted for five minutes . 
You try to make that cat faint for a moment . 
Or could you use Dobby , Harry ? 
I bet Dobby would be willing to do anything to help you . 
I do not complain or anything but my heart aches all over . It cautiously stood up , hands rub the two ribs . 
Hermione said impatiently : 
Did you miss some pillows , you see ? 
Just try again and fall backwards ! 
She rearranged the pillows they had used in the extramural study that Professor Flitwick left in the closet . 
Ron said , 
How did you manage to get it right , Hermione ? 
Why do not you try ? 
Hermione said hastily : 
Well , Harry can do it anyway . 
And we do not even have to worry about the Enchantments , since Harry has been doing that for a long time . I think we should start practicing these mantras tonight . 
Hermione looked down at the list they had set up in the library . 
She said : This is a look at this . 
This reluctance curse will slow down anything that is going to attack you . 
We will start practicing this curse first . 
Ring . 
The three of them hastily flushed Flitwick's pillowcase and left the classroom . 
Hermione said : 
At dinner time see you again . 
She went to Arithmetic while Harry and Ron went toward the North Tower to study Prophecy . 
Yellow strips of light shone through the high window frames forming wide stripes in the corridor . 
The outside sky was blue as if glazed . 
As Ron and Harry climbed up the stairs to the silver staircase leading to the shutter , Ron said : " In Trelawney's room , it must be hot now . 
I never shut down that fireplace . It's quite right . 
The room was dimly lit to sweat , and the smell of fire burned more incense than ever . Harry's head was spinning as he approached the closed window . 
As Professor Trelawney was looking at another direction , and was busy removing her crumpled scarf from a lampshade , Harry opened the window about two inches , then returned to the fabric chair . Its colorful flowers , so it enjoys a gentle breeze clawed across the face , extremely pleasant . 
Professor Trelawney sat down at the two - sided armchair in front of the classroom and looked around the pupils with eyes wide open in a strange way : 
Dear children , we almost completed the set of a Heavenly Prophet . 
Today , however , will be an excellent opportunity to test the effect of Mars , because this crystal is being placed in the present time in a very interesting way . 
If all of you look this way , you will dim the light 
The professor waved a wand and the lights went out . 
Now the light emanating from the fireplace is the only light source . 
Professor Trelawney bent down and picked up , from beneath her chair , a miniature model of the solar system placed in a glass dome . It is a very beautiful item . 
The bright moon flickered around nine planets and a fiery sun , all suspended in the dim air inside the glass . 
Harry glanced at Professor Trelawney as he began to point to the angles that Mars and Neptune combined . 
The smell of smoke smothered passionately over his face , and the wind blew through the gap of the window , caressing his face . 
He heard an insect buzzing somewhere behind the curtain . 
His eyes began to fall 
Harry was riding on an eagle owl , darting through the blue sky toward an old , ivy - covered cottage on a hill . 
The wind blew smoothly over Harry's face , and the eagle owl flew downward , lowering it , until it reached the darkened window and the cistern of the house floor , then flew inside . flying along a murky corridor , to a room at the top with it flying through the door to the darkened room with its windows closed . 
Harry left the back of the eagle owl . Harry watched the bird , flapping his wings across the room , to a chair with his back to Harry beside a chair with two black shadows on the floor of both rooms . is shaking A shadow is a gigantic snake The shadow is a man a dwarf man , a man with dank eyes and a pointed spit whistling and sobbing on the left rug in front of the fireplace From somewhere deep in the armchair that the eagle owl had just landed , a cold , high - pitched sound : 
Mi luck , the tail of Trun . 
Mi is very lucky . 
Your silly mistake does not destroy anything . 
He died . 
The man on the floor panting : 
My Excellency , my Excellency , I am also very sorry 
Cold voice interrupted : 
Nagini , you're not very lucky . 
After all , I will not bring your tail to your mouth but nothing at all , that's fine with Harry Potter . 
Snake hissed . 
Harry could see the snake's tongue flutter . 
The cold voice resounded : 
Now , Wormtail , maybe there should be a little more reminder why we will not ignore one more blunders of mi 
Oh , please do not beg him 
A wand came from the back of the chair with his back to Harry . 
wand tip pointed at worm tail . 
The cold voice said , 
Crucio ! 
The wail sounded as if every nerve in his body was burning on fire , the screams pierced Harry's ear as the scar on his forehead ached . 
It also screams Voldemort can hear it , will know it is there 
Harry ! 
Harry ! 
Harry opened his eyes . 
It was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney's classroom , his hands clenched . 
The scar still burns so badly that it tears out . 
The pain is real pain . 
The class was standing around it , and Ron was kneeling next to him , his face frightening . 
Asked Ron : How are you ? 
Of course not . 
Professor Trelawney said she was extremely moved . 
Two big eyes peered down at Harry , staring at him . 
What is Potter ? 
Thunder throats ? 
Enter the god ? 
What did you see ? 
Harry lied : 
No problem . 
He sat up . 
He felt trembling . 
He could not help but look around , trying to find the shadows behind him , Voldemort's voice almost too close . 
Professor Trelawney said : 
I have scarred your scar . 
I was rolling on the floor , clutching my scar ! 
Come on , you've experienced such problems . Harry looked up at Professor Trelawney . 
He said : I think I need vaginal discharge . 
Headache too . 
Professor Trelawney said : 
Baby , I'm sure you were agitated by the invisible impulses in your room ! 
If you leave now , you will probably lose sight of what you have seen 
Harry said : 
I do not want to see anything other than a cure for headaches . 
Harry stood up . 
Class back . 
All seem bewildered . 
Harry whispered to Ron : 
See you later . 
Harry picked up his briefcase and headed for the door , not paying attention to Professor Trelawney . 
She was expressing a terrible angry expression , as if she had been denied a feast . 
When Harry down the Trelawney's stairs , he did not go to void . 
It has no intention of going there . 
Sirius told him what to do once his scar grew painful , and Harry was about to follow Sirius : it went straight to Dumbledore's office . 
He walked down the corridor , thinking about what he had seen in the dream that was obviously the same as the dream that had woken him up in the Privet Drive house . He reviewed the details in his mind . He had heard Voldemort accuse the Worm of making a silly mistake , but the owl had brought the good news , that the blundering mistake 
was repaired , someone died so the worm's tail was not fed to the snake and it , Harry , would be killed by that network . 
Harry went straight past the stone guard's head guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office without notice . 
He blinked , looked around and realized what he had done , then turned around , stopping in front of the animal head . 
Then he remembered that he did not know the password . 
It hesitated to try : 
Lemon cream ? 
The stone head did not move . 
Harry glared at him : 
Okay . 
Candy Le ? 
What is licorice ? 
He smiled ? 
Drooble's most bittersweet candy ? 
Candy is full of Bertie Bott , oh , do not you like those candies ? 
Oh , please open the door . 
Does it open up ? 
Harry exclaimed , 
I need to see you , urgent thing ! 
The head of the stone is awake . 
Harry kicked it off , gaining nothing more than a pain in the air at the tip of his toes . 
He slams one leg , screams : 
Chocolate pudding 
Candy Pen ! 
Panda Bean ! 
The stone suddenly jumped up and jumped to the side . 
Harry blinked . 
She uttered astonishedly : 
Gill bro ? 
I say that right ? 
He hurried through the open hole on the wall and set foot on the stone twisted staircase , which slowly moved upward in spiral as the door closed behind Harry , bringing it up . to a polished oak door with a bright copper door knob . 
He heard voices coming from inside . 
He stepped out of the stairs , hesitated , then heard a voice : 
Dumbledore , I'm afraid you do not see the connection , do not see anything ! 
That is the voice of Minister of Magic , Cornelius Fudge . 
He continued : 
Mr Ludo said it was entirely possible that Bertha had strayed . 
I agree that there was a time when we thought we would find her , but in the end , we have no evidence of illegal fraud , Dumbledore , there is no evidence . 
Because her disappearance was related to the disappearance of Mr. Crouch 
Master Moody's voice rang out : 
And what do you think happened to Mr. Crouch , Minister ? 
Mr. Fudge said : 
I see two possibilities , Morning Spirit . 
Or was Crouch finally crazy , this could be so , I'm sure he agreed , due to his insecure personal circumstances and wandering somewhere . 
Dumbledore said calmly : 
In that case , he hastily wandered , Mr. Cornelius . 
Mr. Fudge looked confused : 
Well , or , well , I ' ll keep my judgment until after I see where Mr Crouch is found , but you say it's only a little distance from the Beauxbatons coach ? 
Dumbledore , you know what that woman is ? 
Dumbledore said softly : 
I consider her a very competent principal and a good dancer . 
Mr. Fudge was angry : 
Well , Dumbledore ! 
Do not you think she might have thought well of her just for Hagrid ? 
Not all of them were harmless at all if it was true that Hagrid could be regarded as harmless , even when he enjoyed the monsters . 
Dumbledore said calmly : 
I do not doubt Mrs. Maxime more than Mr. Hagrid at all . I think perhaps it was you who had that prejudice , Mr. Cornelius . 
Mr. Moody grumbled : 
Can we finish this discussion ? 
Mr. Fudge lost his patience : 
Yes , well , let's go down to the school grounds . 
Mr. Moody says : 
No , that's not it . 
The discussion should pause because Potter has something to tell you , Dumbledore . 
The boy was standing at the door . 
CHAPTER 30 
The door to the office opened . 
Mr. Moody says : 
Hello , Potter . 
I'm here ! 
Harry walked in . 
Previously she had been to Dumbledore's office once . 
The beautiful circle room , on the wall , was full of portraits of his predecessors , all of them asleep , their breasts gently rising and falling . 
Cornelius Fudge stood up at Dumbledore's desk , wearing a plaid shirt he wore and holding a blue melon - shaped hut . 
Mr. Fudge happily stepped forward , saying : 
Harry ! 
How are you ? Harry lied : 
Yes , I'm fine . 
Mr. Fudge said : 
We were talking about the night Mr. Crouch appeared on the school grounds . 
I'm the one who found him , right ? 
Harry replied , 
Yes . 
And then feel fake as if not hear the story that people are saying it is not , it added to say : 
But I do not see where Mrs. Maxime is , and she's got a job , is not she ? 
Dumbledore smiled at Harry from behind Mr. Fudge , his eyes flashing . 
Mr. Fudge looked confused : 
Oh , well , we're going to have to walk a bit in the schoolyard . 
Harry , I can feel sorry for us maybe I should go back to my class 
Harry said quickly , looking directly at Dumbledore : 
Teacher , I want to talk to you . 
Dumbledore looked at Harry with a quick look . THE END says : 
I waited for you here , Harry . 
The teachers check the school grounds not long . 
The three adults silently walked past Harry to get out and shut the door . 
After about a minute or so , Harry heard Moody's wooden footstool knock down the side of the hallway . 
He looked around . 
Hello Fawkes ! 
Fawkes is Dumbledore's phoenix . 
It was standing on a gold pole next to the window . 
It's a goose with a gorgeous yellow and purple coat . 
Fawkes waved his long tail and winked at Harry in a nice way . 
Harry sat down on the chair in front of Dumbledore's desk . 
For many minutes , he sat there watching the old principals and the old principals snoring in the picture frames , thinking about what he had just heard , and putting his finger on his scar . . 
Now the scar is gone . 
Not knowing why , but now in Dumbledore's office , he felt much calmer , knowing that it was only a matter of time before he could tell his dream . 
Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk . 
The old sorting hats patch and litter on a shelf . 
Next to the hat is a glass box containing a magnificent silver sword , with a sword to the huge ruby . 
Harry remembered it was the sword he had once drawn from the hat . 
This sword belonged to Godric Gryffindor , founder of Harry Gryffindor . 
Harry stared at the sword , remembering the way the sword had helped him when he thought there was no hope . Suddenly Harry noticed a silver light dancing on the glass box . 
He looked around at the source of that light , only to see a glow of brilliant silver emanating from a cupboard behind his back . 
The door of this closet is not very close . 
Harry hesitated , glaring at the Fawkes , then stood up , passing the office , pulling the cabinet door open . 
Inside the door is a stone pot , with carvings around the edges : the ancients and the symbols that Harry did not recognize . 
The silver shimmer came from within the pot , something Harry had never seen before . 
It can not be said that the substance is liquid or gas . It is a bright silver and is constantly moving . 
The surface of the substance is as buoyant as the water , and then again like clouds , it separates and rolls smoothly . 
It was like a liquid made of liquid - or like a solid wind - Harry could not come to a conclusion . 
He wanted to touch that , to see how it felt , but the experience of the magical world in the past four years taught Harry how to reach for a pot full of stuff that he did not know what . That's a stupid thing to do . 
So he drew his wand from within his robes , looked anxiously around the office again , then looked at the contents inside the pot , and then poked his wand in there . 
The surface of the silver iridescence in the pot began to swirl so fast . 
Harry leaned closer , his head in the closet . 
Things like silver gradually become transparent , looking like glass . 
Harry looked down , saw the bottom of the stone pot - but found beneath the surface of the secret was an immense room , a room that looked as if through a round window on the ceiling . home . 
The room was dimly lit ; Harry thought this room was on the ground , because there were no windows , only the torches lit on torches , like the torches lit up the walls of Hogwarts Castle . 
Harry lowered his face so lowly that his nose was only a centimeter away from the transparent substance , and he saw each row of witches and wizards sitting around , along the walls , on what looked like The benches are raised high and low according to status . In the middle of the room is an empty chair . 
The chair looked something that made Harry feel so good . 
Around the chair is a chain , as if still tied to sit on it . 
Where is this place ? Certainly not Hogwarts . 
Harry has never seen a room like that here , in this castle . 
In addition , the crowd in the bottom of the pot room was an adult , and Harry Potter knew there were not many teachers at Hogwarts . 
He thought , it seemed that they were waiting for something , even though it could only see the tip of their hat , but all the faces seemed to look in one direction , and no one was talking to . each other 
The pot was round , with Harry's room looking square , so Harry did not know what was going on in the corners . 
He leaned closer and lowered his head and tried to look 
The tip of the nose touches the strange substance it is looking through . 
Dumbledore's office suddenly swayed violently - Harry was thrown in front of him and put his head inside the pot . 
But its head did not hit the bottom of the pot , but it fell down , falling through something black and cold as ice ; As if it was sucked into a dark swirling pool 
Then , suddenly , Harry noticed that he was sitting , on a bench at the bottom of the room , a bench higher than the benches . 
He looked up at the stone ceiling , as if he saw the round window that he had been looking through , but above nothing else than a solid stone ceiling and darkness . 
Harry looked around , breathing as fast as he could . 
No wizard or witch sees it . ( There must be at least two hundred people at all . ) No one seemed to notice a fourteen - year - old kid just falling from the ceiling and sitting among them . 
Harry turned to the magician sitting beside him on the bench and uttered a wail of astonishment , a shrill rumble in the quiet room . 
He was sitting next to Albus Dumbledore . 
Harry hastily said in his voice : 
Sir ! 
I'm sorry I did not intend to just look at the pots in the closet this is where you are ? 
But Dumbledore did not move . 
He completely ignored Harry . 
Like all the wizards and sorcerers sitting on the bench , Dumbledore gazed into the far corner of the room , where there was a door . 
Harry also looked at Dumbledore , awkwardly , then looked around at that silent crowd , then back at Dumbledore . 
And suddenly his mind suddenly flashed 
Once upon a time , Harry found it in a place where no one could see or hear it . 
Once upon a time , it had sunk into a magical diary , right in the memory of another , and this time it seemed to be happening , unless it was a big mistake . 
Harry's right hand came up , hesitated , then enthusiastically waved in front of Dumbledore . 
Dumbledore did not blink , did not turn back to look at Harry , did not move at all . 
And that , in Harry's opinion , seemed to have clarified the matter . 
Dumbledore could not ignore it . 
It must have been in someone's memory , and Dumbledore was not the current Dumbledore . 
But it's not that old . Dumbledore sitting next to him was also a bearded blonde like Dumbledore now . 
But where is this place ? 
What are all the wizards and witches waiting for ? 
Harry looked around more carefully . 
As it was suspected from the above , this room was almost certainly underground , Harry thought , more like a cellar than a room . 
The air in the room suffocated and gloomy . 
On the wall there is no picture , nor any other decoration . 
Only a series of benches , rising high and low throughout the room , were all set up in such a way that there was a clear view toward the chair that was full of chains around the chairs . 
Harry did not come to a conclusion about the place where people are sitting here , then he heard footsteps . 
The door at the far corner of the tunnel opened and the three men came in - or to say exactly one man and two Azkabans . 
Inside Harry's body was cold . 
The Azkaban dementors are tall , hooded creatures . 
They glanced slowly toward the vacant seat in the middle of the room , each of the dementors grabbing a man's arm with a rotten hand . 
The man they were kidnapped was almost dying , and Harry did not blame him . He knew this was just a memory , so the dementors of Azkaban could not touch it , but he still remembered the power of the men . that prisoner is too obvious . The crowd was staring back at the Azkaban Sentinels putting the man on the shackle chair and retreating from the room . 
The door closed behind them . 
Harry looked down at the man in the chair and recognized it as Karkaroff . 
Unlike Dumbledore , Karkaroff looks much younger ; His hair and beard are still black . 
He does not wear fur coats , but wears a thin trench coat . 
He was trembling . 
Just as Harry was looking , the chains on the arm of the chair suddenly glowed yellow and stretched like a snake , wrapping himself in Karkaroff's arms , tying him in the chair . 
Harry left a curly voice : 
Igor Karkaroff ! 
Harry turned around and saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench next to him . 
Mr. Crouch's hair was black too , his face not so wrinkled . 
He looked neat and alert . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
He was taken from the Azkaban prison to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . 
He made us understand that he has important information that he wants to provide us . 
Mr. Karkaroff tried his best to sit up straight , despite being tied up in his chair . 
Sir , I have information . 
Although Karkaroff's voice was very frightened , Harry could still hear the familiar , familiar , faded melody in his voice . 
I look forward to being helpful to the Ministry of Magic . 
I look forward to helping . 
I know the Ministry is trying to get the last of the Dark Lord supporters . 
I am very eager to help you in any way I can 
The murmurs spread among the wizards and sorcerers sitting on the bench . 
Some are observing Karkaroff with interest , others claim to be unbelieving . 
Then , Harry heard , very clearly , from Dumbledore's other side , a familiar growl said : 
Garbage ! 
Harry leaned forward to look at Dumbledore . 
Brother Moody Eyes - crazy sitting there . 
This crazy Moody - Eye figure is remarkably different . 
You do not have an eye ; which has two normal eyes . 
Both eyes were looking down at Mr. Karkaroff , and both eyes narrowed in fierce hatred . 
Moody whispered to Dumbledore : 
Mr. Crouch was about to release him . 
He agreed with him . 
It took me six months to get him , so Mr Crouch released him , as long as he spewed out enough names . 
I see , we just listen to his information , and then threw him straight to pay the Azkaban dementors . 
Dumbledore whispered a little distaste from his long , curly nose . 
Brother Moody Eyes - madly mockingly laughed : 
Ah , forget , I forgot that you did not like the Azkaban Dementors , did you , Dumbledore ? 
Dumbledore calmly replied : 
it's correct . 
I'm afraid I do not like them very much . 
I have long felt that the Ministry of Magic is wrong to associate with such creatures . 
Moody said gently : 
But with these rubbish guys 
Mr. Crouch is saying : 
Mr. Karkaroff , you said you wanted to point out their names , so we're listening . 
Mr. Karkaroff hurriedly said , 
You have to understand that Who - Who - Know - Who - is always operating in the most secret way He wants to be us . I mean , his disciples , and I'm very sorry now , I've been in that number 
Master Moody scornfully said : 
Say continue . 
We never knew the names of the guys who were alone . He knew exactly who we were 
Moody murmured : 
That's a wise move , is not it ? To stop those who turn around like you , Karkaroff , from selling them all . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
But he says he has some of the guys they want to point out to us . 
Mr Karkaroff said breathlessly : 
Yes , I have . 
And that's the name of his great forefathers , I would like to remind you of this . Those are the people I saw with their own eyes . 
I provided this information as a sign that I had completely abandoned myself , and my heart was full of repentance so deep that I could hardly 
Mr. Crouch said , 
What are the names ? 
Karkaroff took a deep breath . 
He said : 
it's Antonin Dolohov . 
I saw him torturing countless Muggles and people who did not follow the Dark Side . 
Moody murmured : 
And you did it . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
We have arrested Mr. Dolohov . 
He was arrested shortly after his arrest . 
Mr Karkaroff opened his eyes and said , 
Really ? 
I was glad to hear that . 
But he did not look happy . . 
Harry could say that the news was a fist in his face . 
One of his names was worthless . 
Mr. Crouch asked coldly , 
Who else ? 
Huh ? Oh , there's Rosier , Evan Rosier . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
Rosier was dead . 
He was arrested immediately after him . 
He would rather fight back than quietly surrender , and was killed while fighting . 
Brother Moody on the right Harry mumbled : 
He brought me down a part of my body . 
Harry turned his head to see Moody again , and saw that he was pointing Dumbledore to see his big nose . 
Mr. Karkaroff exclaimed , now his voice sounded real terror . 
No one is better than Rosier ! 
Harry could see that he was beginning to worry that none of his information was available to the Ministry . 
Karkaroff's eyes peered at the door in the corner of the room . Behind that door , surely the Azkaban Priests are still waiting . 
Mr. Crouch asked : 
Anyone else ? 
Mr Karkaroff said : 
Yes . 
Travers assassinated the McKinnons ! 
And Mulciber is the author of the authoritative curse , forcing many people to do terrible things ! and Rookwood , a spy , had useful information from within the Ministry of Magic for Who - Who - Who - Know - Who . 
This time , Harry could say that Mr. Karkaroff had dug gold . The crowd observed each other screaming : 
Rookwood ? 
Is Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Confidentiality ? 
Mr. Crouch said , nodding at a sorcerer sitting in front of him , who began to hiss on her parchment . 
Mr. Karkaroff was enthusiastic : 
he's just 
I believe he used a well - organized network of mages , both inside and outside the ministry , to gather information . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
But we knew Mr. Travers and Mr. Mulciber . 
Very well , Mr. Karkaroff , if that is all , he will be taken back to Azkaban prison while waiting for us to decide . 
Mr. Karkaroff exclaimed : 
Not yet ! 
Please wait a moment I know many other names as well . 
Harry could see Karkaroff sweat in the torchlight , his white skin contrasting strongly with the blackness of his hair and beard . 
He shouted : Snape ! 
Severus Snape ! 
Mr Crouch said scornfully : 
Mr. Snape has been acquitted by this committee . 
He was verified by Dumbledore . 
Are not ! 
Mr. Karkaroff shrieked , tugging at the shackles tied to him in the chair . 
I assure you ! 
Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! 
Dumbledore stood up . 
Quietly said : 
I have given evidence of this already . 
Severus Snape is actually a Death Eater . 
However , he returned to justice just before Lord Voldemort collapsed , and he became a spy for us , which was a very personal danger for him . 
Now he has no more Death Eaters than myself . 
Harry turned to Moody Eyes - crazy behind Dumbledore . 
On his face a deep suspicion . 
Mr. Crouch said coldly , 
Very well , Mr. Karkaroff , you have helped with the information . 
I will review your case . 
In the meantime , he will return to Azkaban 
Mr Crouch's voice narrowed . 
Harry looked around , the basement vanished as if it were made of smoke , everything faded away , it just looked at itself , and all else was darkness . 
And then , the tunnel came out again . 
Harry was sitting in another place , still on the highest bench , but now it was Crouch's left . 
The air seems so different : more relieved , even more eager . 
The witches and wizards sitting around , along the walls , were talking to each other , as if they were discussing a sporting event . 
Harry noticed a witch sitting in the opposite row of benches . 
She had a short blonde hair , dressed in a bright red cape , and was sucking on one end of a green gooseberry pestle . 
Can not be mistaken , it is Miss Rita Skeeter young . 
Harry looked around ; Dumbledore was sitting next to him , wearing another robe . 
Mr. Crouch showed a tired expression and wondered why his face was haggard and fiercer than Harry understood . That is another memory , another day another trial . 
The door in the corner opened again , and Ludo Bagman entered the room . 
However , this is not a full Ludo Bagman , but a Ludo Bagman apparently at the height of a fit Quidditch player . 
At this point his nose was not broken ; He was tall , neat , and athletic . 
Mr. Bagman seemed tense as he sat down on a chained chair , but it did not tie him up like he had chopped off Karkaroff . 
Mr. Bagman , perhaps relieved by the fact that he was not chained , glanced around the crowd watching the trial , waved some of the crowd , and molded a small smile on his face . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
Ludo Bagman , he was brought before the Legislative Council to answer allegations about the activities of the Death Eaters . 
We have heard evidence against him , and are about to make a ruling . 
What do you want to add to your testimony before the court pronouncement ? 
Harry could not believe his ears . 
Is Ludo Bagman Death Eater ? 
Mr. Bagman smiled awkwardly : 
Only I know I was a bit stupid 
Some witches and wizards sat on the stairs around smiling with tolerance . 
Mr. Crouch does not seem to sympathize at all . 
He was staring at Ludo Bagman with an extremely strict expression and hatred . 
Well , he never said a word more real . 
Someone's voice was dry with Dumbledore behind Harry's back . 
She turned to see Moody again sitting there . 
If I had not known him so stupidly , I would have guessed that in some Bludgers he had hit the head with a permanent effect . 
Mr. Crouch said : 
Mr. Ludo Bagman , he was caught red - handed information to Voldemort's underlings . 
Because of this , I propose a minimum prison sentence of Azkaban 
But at that moment , from the crowd sitting on the bench around the angry laughter . many witches and wizards sat up along the walls , got up and shook their heads at Crouch . 
Mr. Bagman said earnestly to the crowd : 
But as I told you , I do not know anything ! 
Do not know what , but ! 
Rookwood , a friend of my father , did not have the slightest suspicion that he was going to follow the One - Know - Who side . 
I thought I was gathering information for my side ! 
And Mr. Rookwood promised to get me a job in the Ministry later . Once my Quidditch game is over , you know that I mean I can not let the Bludgers fool my head . Is that true ? 
There was a giggle in the crowd . 
Mr. Crouch said coldly , 
I will put this to vote . 
Mr. Crouch turned to the right of the cellar : 
The jury will raise the hand of the people who agree to jail 
Harry looked to the right of the basement . 
No one raised his hand . 
Many wizards and wizards around them began to clap their hands . 
A witch in the jury stood up . 
Mr. Crouch immediately : 
Please ! 
The witch says no to steam : 
We just want to congratulate Bagman for playing for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey on Saturday . 
Mr. Crouch was mad . 
But now the cellar was shaking with applause . 
Mr. Bagman stood up , bowed and beamed . 
furniture ! 
Mr. Crouch cursed as he sat down beside Dumbledore , watching Bagman go out of the cellar : 
Rookwood is supposed to earn him a job the day Ludo joins our ranks would be a sad day for the Ministry of Magic , actually . 
The basement vanishes again . 
And as the basement reappeared , Harry looked around . 
He and Dumbledore were still sitting next to Mr. Crouch , but the air was strangely unprecedented . 
Completely silent , only the dry cheeks of a frail , thin sorceress sitting next to Mr. Crouch resounded . 
She clutched at her handkerchief , trembling . 
Harry looked at Mr. Crouch , seeing him haggard and graying even more than before . 
A blood vessel twitching on his temples . 
He said loudly in the silence of the tunnel : 
bring them in . 
The door in the corner of the room once again opened . 
Six Azkaban dictators came in , clutching a group of four . 
Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look at Mr. Crouch . 
Some people whispered to each other . 
The Azkaban dementors put each of the four men on a shackled call now placed in the middle of the tunnel . 
They were a man of stupefying idiots who gazed at Mr. Crouch ; another man was sicker and more restless , more anxious , eyes fluttering at the crowd ; a slim dark - haired woman , her eyes wide , sitting on a chair as if sitting on a throne ; and a teenager about eighteen and nineteen years old , seems to have been petrified . 
The young man shivered , his straw - colored hair flushed down the freckled , white - tinted face . 
The fragile sorceress sitting next to Mr. Crouch began to squat on her seat , her face in the handkerchief moaning wailing . 
Mr. Crouch stood up . 
He looked down at the four men sitting in front of him , but on the butt of his face there was only a hatred . 
Mr. Crouch said clearly : 
The people were brought here before the Legislative Council for us to judge you , for a terrible crime . 
The boy with straw - colored hair cried out : 
Daddy , please 
Mr. Crouch said even louder , over his son's aura : 
that we rarely hear a similar incident in this court . 
We have heard evidence against you . 
Four people have been charged with abducting a God of Light - Frank Longbottom - and subjected them to torture , because he knows the current hiding place of your exiled master , call - name - out 
The boy was tied up on the lower bench screaming : 
Daddy , I did not do that ! 
I did not do that , I swear to you , do not bring me to hand in hand Azkaban dementors . 
Mr Crouch shouted : 
People are even more likely to commit suicide when they refuse to torture Frank Longbottom's wife when he refuses to provide information to you . 
Those who attempt to restore the power of the Caller are out there , and to restore the cruel life that they think will be enjoyed when he is mighty . 
Now I would like to ask for a jury opinion 
Mama ! 
The boy sits underneath him , and the fragile sorceress next to Mr. Crouch begins sobbing , who just swayed , leaned forward and fell back . 
Mama , can you go ? 
I did not do it ! 
I'm not here ! 
Mr. Crouch shouted : 
Now I would like to ask the jury . 
If you believe that I believe these crimes deserve life imprisonment in Azkaban , then please raise your hand . 
The witches and wizards sitting to the right of the basement at the same time hands up . the crowd around the walls began to clap their hands as applauded by Bagman , their faces filled with savage triumphs . 
The boy burst out crying . 
Are not ! 
Oh , do not ! 
I did not do that , I did not do , I do not know anything . Do not give them to me , mama , do not let me do it ! 
Diverse Azkaban glided back into the basement . 
The three of them quietly stood up ; The woman looked up and saw Mr Crouch shouting : 
Dark Knight will rise again , Crouch ! 
You throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! 
The Dark Lord will rise again and come to our rescue , will reward us more than any of his servants ! 
Only we are loyal ! 
Only we are trying to find you ! 
But the young man struggled out of the hands of the Azkaban dementors ; Even Harry could see the desperate power of the Azkaban dementors to exert their influence . 
As the woman walked out of the cellar , the crowd mocked , some of them standing up . 
The boy is still struggling . 
He screamed to Mr. Crouch : 
You are my son ! 
You are my son ! 
Mr. Crouch screamed back , his eyes suddenly protruding : 
You are not my child ! 
Tao no son ! 
The fragile woman next to Mr. Crouch hiccupped a loud noise and collapsed into the seat . 
She fainted . 
Mr. Crouch does not seem to notice . 
He was covering the Dukes of Azkaban , spraying his tongue out of his mouth : 
take them away take them away ! 
And let them rotten in it ! 
Daddy ! 
Dad , I have no involvement ! 
Are not ! Are not ! No , please 
Harry , I think it's time to come back to your office . 
Harry's voice echoed . 
He looked around startled . 
Then he looked to the side . 
To the right it still had a Dumbledore sitting there , looking at Crouch's son being dragged by the Azkaban Dreadlocks and left with a Dumbledore , looking directly at him . 
Dumbledore sat on Harry's left , saying : 
Stop it . 
He reached for Harry's elbow . 
He felt as if his spirit was rising in the air , the tunnel around it vanishing ; For a moment , all was black , and then it felt as though it was doing a slow - moving acrobatic movement , and suddenly landed on its feet , in a seemingly illuminated office . Dumbledore . 
The pot was shimmering in the closet in front of him , and Dumbledore was standing beside him . 
Harry panicked : 
Teacher , I know you should not have children without the intention at the door it is as open and 
Dumbledore said : 
He completely understood . 
He picked up the pot , put it on his desk , placed it on the glossy table , and sat down on the chair behind the table . 
He gestured for Harry to sit down facing him . 
Harry sat down , gazing at the stone pot . 
The contents of the pot had returned to its original white , silver , gently curved and wavy under Harry's gaze . 
It asks : 
Teacher , what is it ? 
Dumbledore said : 
Is this 
It calls the Sign . Sometimes I feel , and I'm sure I sometimes feel that way , I have too many thoughts and memories in my head . 
Err 
Harry , he can not honestly say he felt the same way . 
Dumbledore pointed to the stone pot , continued : 
At those times , he used this Sign . 
A way to get rid of the excess ideas in his head , pour it in the pot , and when it is free , bring it to contemplate . 
When ideas come in this form , finding the models and connections becomes much easier , do you understand ? 
Harry looked up at the white substance swirling in the pot , asking : 
Do you say that substance is your mind ? 
Dumbledore said : 
it's correct . Let me show you . 
Dumbledore drew his wand from inside his robes and placed his wand on his silver hair , close to his temples . 
When he took the wand , his hair seemed to stick to the tip of the chopsticks , but then Harry saw that it was actually a glistening glow of the same silvery white liquid filling in the signpost . 
Dumbledore put this new thought into the pot , and Harry stared at his face that was swimming around the surface of the pot . 
Dumbledore put his two long hands up and turned around , a bit like a gold hunter treating pieces of gold . And Harry saw his face smoothly change into Snape's face . 
Snape was opening his mouth to the ceiling , his voice slightly resounding : 
It is back to Mr. Karkaroff too much stronger and clearer than ever 
Dumbledore sighed : 
A connection that we can not do without help . 
But that's okay . 
He peered over his pair of half - moon glasses to see Harry , the boy gaping his breath , watching Snape's face continue to swirl around in the pot . 
He was using this sign when Mr. Fudge came to the teacher to discuss the work , he took it a little rush . 
Surely he did not close the closet door . 
Of course it caught my attention . 
Harry whispered : 
I'm sorry . 
Dumbledore shook his head . 
Curiosity is not a sin . 
But we should be very careful with our curiosity . 
Yeah , that's right 
With a frown , he stirred the thoughts inside the pot with his wand . 
Immediately , a picture emerges , a chubby girl about sixteen years old is slowly shaping , her legs still in the pot . 
She did not care about Harry or Dumbledore . 
As she spoke , her voice sounded like Snape's , as if resounding from the bottom of the stone pot : 
Dear Dumbledore , I am a spell , but you just tease me , mister . 
I just said that I saw the Florence honeymoon behind the glass enclosure last Thursday 
Dumbledore looked at the girl who was still spinning quietly . 
He said sadly , 
But why , Bertha , why did you follow him first ? 
Harry whispered : 
Bertha ? 
Is that Bertha Jorkins ? 
Right . 
Dumbledore teased the thoughts in the pot . 
Bertha dies inside , and the inside of the pot once again becomes white as silver : 
that is , it is lost in it , and the inside of the pot once again becomes white as silver : 
It was Bertha Jorkins that he asked her when she was in school . 
The silver light shone from Dumbledore's face , and Harry suddenly realized how old he was . 
Of course , Harry knew that Dumbledore had been old for a long time , but he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man . 
Dumbledore quietly said : 
Harry , what do you want to say to me before I fell into your thoughts ? 
Harry said : 
Yes , my teacher has just been in the classroom , and I have fallen asleep 
He hesitated at this , wondering if it had been blamed on this , but Dumbledore simply said , 
He is completely sympathetic . 
Continue . 
Harry said : 
Yes , I dreamed a dream about Voldemort . 
He is torturing tails Worm do you know Worm's tail ? 
Dumbledore said right away : 
You know . 
You keep talking . 
Voldemort received a letter from him . 
He said something , apparently the stupid mistake of the worm tail was corrected . 
He said someone was dead . 
Then he said , the worm will not be fed to Snake - there is a snake next to his chair . 
He said he would feed the snake instead . 
Then he read the curse of torture , punishing the worm's tail and his scar for the most pain . 
I wake up and the scar is hurt . 
Dumbledore just looked at Harry . 
It says : 
That's just it . 
Dumbledore quietly said : 
I understand . 
I understand . 
At other times during the school year , did your scar ache , except that it wakes you up in the summer ? 
Yes , but how can you know that the pain of the scar has woken her up in the summer ? 
Dumbledore said : 
I'm not the only one who's been through with Sirius . 
He has also contacted him since he left Hogwarts last year . 
It was he who proposed to take the cave on the slope to make it the safest place for him to stay . 
Dumbledore stood up and started walking back and forth behind his desk . 
Occasionally he placed his wand on his temples , drawing another thought that shimmered silver , and dropped it into the thinking bowl . 
The thought inside the pot began to spin , so fast that Harry could not clearly distinguish what was at all : it was just a faded color . 
A few minutes later , Harry whispered : 
Sir ? 
Dumbledore stopped to look at Harry . 
He said softly : 
I'm sorry 
He sat down at his desk . 
Harry asked : 
Do you know why my scar is aching ? 
Dumbledore looked at Harry for a moment , then said , 
You have a hypothesis , just hypothesis . I believe my scar is aching even when Voldemort comes near me , and when he is in a particularly strong hatred . 
But why ? 
Because you and I have been unsuccessfully linked together . 
That scar is not a normal scar . 
So do you think the dream is real ? 
Dumbledore said : 
May . 
You mean , Harry , do you see Voldemort ? 
Harry said : 
Yes , no . 
Only see the back of the chair . 
But there is nothing to see , right ? Did you say he does not have a body like one ? 
But then how can he raise the wand ? 
Dumbledore murmured : 
Indeed , how ? 
Really is how 
Neither Harry nor Dumbledore spoke for a moment . 
Dumbledore stared across the room , and then once again pointed his wand to his temples and released a stream of silver light shining in the shattered block in the signpost . 
Finally , Harry said , 
Teacher , do you think Voldemort is becoming mighty ? 
Voldemort ? 
Dumbledore looked up from the pot , looking at Harry . 
It was an extremely sharp look that Dumbledore had once seen , and that look made Harry feel like Dumbledore was looking through him in a way that even the eye Moody can not do it . 
Dumbledore said : 
Again , Harry , I can only answer you with my suspicion . 
Dumbledore sighed , and he looked older , tired than ever . 
He said : 
The years that Voldemort climbed to the heights of power were marked by disappearances . 
Bertha has disappeared without a trace in what is known to be the last known place of Voldemort . 
Mr. Crouch also disappeared on campus . 
There is a third disappearance , one that I regret that the Ministry of Magic is not important at all , because it involves a Muggle . 
His name is Frank Bryce , who lives in a village that was the birthplace of Voldemort's father . 
Since last August , nobody has seen Frank anywhere . 
You see , I read Muggle newspapers , not like our ministers . 
Dumbledore looked at Harry very seriously : 
You see these disappearances seem to be related . 
The Minister of Magic did not agree as he probably had heard , waiting outside his office . 
Harry nodded . 
The silence was stifling between them . 
Dumbledore sometimes extracts a line of thought . 
Harry felt as though he should have gone back , but curiosity kept him lingering . 
He said : 
Sir ? 
Dumbledore said : 
What's up , Harry ? 
Will you be able to ask me about the trial in the basin ? 
The heavy Dumbledore replied : 
You are allowed . 
He has attended the court many times , but there are some court cases he can recall more clearly than others , especially now . 
Do you remember the trial of Mr. Crouch's son ? 
Are they talking about Neville's parents ? 
Dumbledore looked at Harry a very sharp one : 
Neville never told me why he grew up with his grandmother ? 
Harry shook his head , and when he shook his head he wondered how it had not asked him that for four years . 
Dumbledore said : 
Yeah , they talked to Neville's parents . 
Neville's father is Frank , a goddess like Professor Moody . 
He and his wife were tortured to get information about Voldemort's hideout after he lost power , as I had heard . 
Harry whispered : 
Are they dead ? 
Dumbledore said , the bitter voice that Harry had never heard before : 
Are not . 
They are crazy . 
They are both in St . Mungo's Hospital , specializing in the treatment of Injury . 
He believed that Neville and his grandmother would visit her parents during the holidays . 
They do not recognize it . 
Harry sat there , shocked . 
It has never known , never , for four years , craving to learn 
Dumbledore said : 
Longbottom family is very famous . 
Attacks on them occurred after Voldemort collapsed , when people thought they were living from now on . 
These attacks triggered an unprecedented wave of indignation . 
The Ministry of Magic is under heavy pressure to catch the person who caused the crime . 
Unfortunately , the evidence of Longbottom is not very credible , in their mental condition . 
Harry slowly said : 
So his son Crouch could not be involved in the affair . 
Dumbledore shook his head . 
About that I have no idea . 
Harry sat quietly again as he watched the contents of the pots swing . 
There are still two questions that he wants to ask to burn the gut but those are questions related to the sin of the living . It says : 
Teacher , Mr. Bagman . 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
Has not been accused of any dark activity since then . 
Harry said hastily , his eyes fixed on the inside of the Pot . 
That substance now slows down because Dumbledore has stopped adding to his lines of thought . 
Yes , but 
The Pot seemed to ask Harry questions . 
Snape's face swam over the surface of the pot . 
Dumbledore looked at the pot and looked up at Harry : 
Professor Snape did not . 
Harry looked into Dumbledore's bright blue eyes , and what he was eager to know had popped out of his mouth before he could close his mouth : 
Teacher , what makes you believe that Snape really does not support Voldemort ? 
Dumbledore responded to Harry's gaze for a few seconds , and then he said , 
Harry , that's a problem between you and Snape . 
Harry knew the interview was over . 
Dumbledore did not look angry , but in his voice there was an end to Harry's understanding that it was time to leave . 
He got up and Dumbledore stood up . 
When Harry went to the door , Dumbledore said , 
Harry , do not talk about Neville's parents for anyone to know . 
Neville has the right to disclose it when it feels ready . 
Harry returned when he turned away : 
Yes , sir , I remember . 
and 
Harry looked back . 
Dumbledore was looking down at the signpost , his face shining with bright silver shining from the pot , as he looked older than ever . 
He looked up at Harry for a moment and said , 
Good luck with the third exam . 
Chapter 31 THIRD TEST 
Ron whispered : 
Dumbledore - who - who - knows - who - is - he's back is strong ? 
Harry had taken everything he had seen in the signpost , and almost everything Dumbledore had told him and showed it to him later , telling Ron and Hermione to listen . 
And of course , even to Sirius ( he sent the punch shortly after leaving Dumbledore's office ) that night Harry , 
Ron and Hermione had been together until late into the night in the common room to discuss all that , until Harry's head was really spinning , and it was Dumbledore's mind , when He talked about a head full of thoughts that he must be relieved to be relieved . 
Ron stared at the fireplace flames in the common room . 
Harry saw Ron slightly shivering , although that night was warm . 
Said Ron : 
And Dumbledore trusted Snape ? 
Do you really trust Snape , though you know he was a Death Eater ? 
Harry said : 
Right . 
Hermione did not say anything for ten minutes . 
She was sitting with her forehead against her hands , her eyes fixed on her knees . 
Harry thought Hermione looked as if it was a need for a sign pot . 
Finally Hermione murmured : 
Rita Skeeter . 
Said Ron , incredulous : 
How can you still worry about her now ? 
Hermione said to her knee : 
I do not care about her . 
I was just thinking of recalling what she'd said to me in the Three Wines Shop . ' I know about Bagman so much that he can make her bang her hair up . ' . 
So this is what she wants to say ? 
She reported the trial of Mr. Bagman , who knew he had delivered the news to the Death Eaters . 
And so does Winky , remember ' Ludo Bagman is a bad wizard . " Mr. Crouch must have been very angry about Mr. Bagman's passing , he was coming home to talk about it . 
Oh , but Bagman is just passing the news . 
Hermione shrugged , Ron turned to Harry , asked : 
And Mr. Fudge thought Mrs. Maxime was attacking Mr. Crouch ? 
Harry said : 
Oh , but he said it was only because Mr Crouch had disappeared near the parking lot of the Beauxbatons . 
Ron said slowly : 
We did not think about it , did we ? 
Note that you are sure there is a giant blood , which is no way to acknowledge . 
Hermione looked up immediately : 
Of course she did not admit it . 
Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita knew about his mother's background . 
Looking at Mr. Fudge , he jumped to the conclusion of her , just because she was a giant . 
Who wants that kind of prejudice ? 
I might as well say that I have a big bone if I know what I'm going to do when I tell the truth . 
Hermione looked at the clock . 
She looked startled , saying : 
We did not practice anything ! 
We have planned to practice the Curse of Tranquility ! 
Tomorrow we will have to make the new sound heard ! 
Come on , Harry , you need a good night's sleep ! 
Harry and Ron walked slowly up the stairs to their bedroom . 
When Harry was in his bed , he looked over to Neville's bed . 
Keeping his promise to Dumbledore , he did not tell Hermione and Ron about Neville's parents . 
When Harry took the glass off and climbed onto the bed with his four pillars , imagine how it would feel when his parents were alive and they did not recognize his baby . 
It often gets the sympathy of strangers about its orbit , but when it is listening to Neville's snoring , it thinks Neville is more pitiful than it is . In the dark , Harry feels a surge offering anger and hatred towards those who tormented the Longbottom . He recalled the scapegoat of the crowd when his son Crouch and his gang were dragged out of court by the Dukes of Azkaban . How did they feel ? Then he remembered the crying face of his son and he was shocked to realize that he died only a year later . 
Harry thought , only at Voldemort . 
In the darkness , he glared at the curtain hanging from his bed , all of which were only in Voldemort . He was the one who destroyed the house and ruined the lives of many . 
Ron and Hermione should be prepared for the exam that will end on the day Harry takes the third exam . 
But they keep spending all their time and effort helping Harry prepare to play . 
When Harry was worried about this and said he was not afraid to practice alone for a while , Hermione dismissed : 
do not worry about that . 
At the very least , we get the maximum score in Anti - Artistic Defense . 
In class , we have found all this time . 
Ron said excitedly : 
This is a good training to do once we all become the Spirit . 
Ron is trying to curse up a bumblebee bubbling into the room and causing it to die standing in the air . 
In June , the atmosphere in the castle became nervous and nervous . 
Everyone looks forward to the third exam , which will take place about a week before the semester ends . 
Whenever possible , Harry will also practice the magic spell . 
He felt confident in the third test than the previous two , although it certainly was difficult and dangerous . 
Brother Moody was right : Harry had managed to get past huge monsters and enchanted barricades , this time it was more advantageous because he had the attention , the chance to prepare himself . I for what wait ahead . 
Professor McGonagall grew tired of having to confront Harry , Ron and Hermione all over the school , so she allowed them to use the Transitional study room to empty at lunchtime . 
Harry had already mastered the Curse of Prevention , a curse that slowed and thwarted the attacking objects ; It also knows the spell can help it blow up solid objects to open the way ; and the curse . The four points are one of Hermione's useful discoveries that can make her wand point toward the north to check that it is in the right lane . 
However Harry is still in trouble with the Shield Shield . 
It should have created a temporary and invisible wall around it to deflect the curses ; but Hermione does not know how to dissipate the Shield by using the spellbinding charms , which then Harry staggers around the room for ten minutes until she earns the evil spell . 
Hermione encourages Harry : 
So you do well . 
She looked down at the catalog and crossed out the spell they had made . 
Some of these spells will definitely need to be in time . 
Ron was standing by the window , staring down at the school grounds , shouting : 
Come on , Malfoy , what are you doing ? 
Hermione ran to see . 
Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle are standing in the shade of a tree under the yard . 
Crabbe and Goyle seem to be guarding ; They both wear silly smiles on their smug faces . 
Malfoy was reaching for his mouth and talking in his hands . 
Harry looked surprised , saying : It looks like he is using a pocket recorder . 
Hermione said : 
It can not be . 
I told you , those things are not available on Hogwarts campus . 
She turned away from the window , went out in the middle of the room , added : 
Go on , Harry . 
We try the Shield Shield again . 
Now Sirius sends a blow every day . 
Like Hermione , he seems to focus on helping Harry pass the final exam before concentrating on anything else . 
Reminds Harry in every letter that whatever may be happening outside the walls of Hogwarts is not part of Harry's responsibility , and Harry's strength is not expected to interfere . 
He wrote : 
If Voldemort really is becoming stronger , your top priority is to ensure your child's safety . 
He can not hope to touch you once you are in Dumbledore's defense ; But anyway , I do not have a problem : focus on getting through the maze safely , and then we will turn our minds to other issues . 
As close to four - six June , Harry's nerves were tense , but not as bad as the anxiety he'd experienced before the first test and the second . 
In part , it is believed that this time it has done everything in its power to prepare for this test . 
Another part is that in this final competition , whether it is good or bad , the competition is finally over , and at that moment it is quite spoiled . 
On the morning of the third test day , breakfast at Gryffindor's table became a noisy meal . 
The mail arrives , giving Harry a good luck card from Sirius . 
It was just a piece of parchment wrapped in paper and had a muddy hide on the front , but Harry loved it very well . 
A cat owls give Hermione a Prophet Daily newspaper as always . 
She opened the newspaper , glanced at the front page , and splashed a sip of liquid squash all over the newspaper . 
Harry and Hermione looked at Hermione and asked : 
What is this ? 
Said Hermione on : 
Nothing at all . 
She tucked away the newspaper , but Ron caught it . 
He glared at the big title and said , 
Stop talking ! true today . 
This old cow . 
Harry asked : 
What is this ? And Rita again ? 
Said Ron : 
Are not . 
And like Hermione , trying to push the newspaper away for the blind . 
Harry asked : 
Write about yourself is not it ? 
Ron said in a voice that was not convincing at all : 
Are not . 
But before Harry could claim the newspaper , Malfoy from the side of the Slytherin table screamed through the hall : 
Hey , Harry Potter , what's your head ? 
How are you feeling ? 
Are you sure you will not mess with us ? 
Malfoy was also holding a Prophet Daily . 
The Slytherins sidled from the top of the table to the bottom of the table , laughing hugely , turning the person on the seat to watch Harry's reaction . 
Harry said to Ron : 
Let me read it . Give it here ! 
Reluctantly , Ron took the newspaper . 
Harry flipped over the newspaper and saw himself staring at the picture below the large cargo : 
HARRY POTTER BLIND AND HARMFUL 
The boy who defeated the Who - Who - Who - knows - it - was a troublemaker and could even be dangerous . 
Special Reporter , Rita Skee ter wrote . 
Recent evidence of concern has been that Harry Potter has had strange behaviors , resulting in skepticism about competing in a competition such as the Magic Trial , even for Hogwarts . 
As the Daily Prophecy has revealed in particular , Potte r often collapses at school , and often complains about the pain of the scar on his forehead . ( Who knew who - who - knows - what - was - he tried to kill him ? ) On Monday , in the midst of the Prophet's class , I witnessed Potter storm out of class , crying that his scar was aching too , unable to continue to learn . 
The leading experts at St . Mungo's Hospital for Illicit Suicide claimed that Potter's brain was influenced by the Who - Who - Who - knows - Who attack . Down to him , and the insistence that the scar is still pain is a way of revealing this boy's insecurity . 
One expert said : Maybe he faked . This can be a way of getting attention . However , the Prophet's Daily had some serious concerns about Harry Potter that Dumbledore , the principal of Hogwarts School , had concealed the magic of the magic . 
A fourth - year student at Hogwarts , Draco Malfoy said : Potter knows slang . 
A number of years ago , many students thought Potter was the culprit after they witnessed it lose their temper in the dueling club and released the snake . another student 
Even so , everything is covered . 
But Potter also made friends with wolves and giants . 
We think this guy is doing anything to make a bit of power . 
Bilingualism is the ability to talk to snakes , long been considered a dark art . 
Indeed , one who knows the famous language of our time is the Who - who - knows - who - is - nobody , but no one else . 
A member of the Confederation of the Black Arts Department , who asked to remain anonymous , expressed that he considered any sorcerer who spoke slang is worth investigating . 
Personally , I highly doubt anyone can play with snakes , because snakes are often used in the darkest of black magic , and historically they are associated with those who do evil . Similarly , anyone who seeks friendship with violent creatures such as wolves or giants will reveal the pleasure of violence . 
Albus Dumbledore should definitely consider that a boy like that should be allowed to compete in the Magic Trilogy . 
Some people fear that Potter might use Dark Arts in desperate desperation to win the competition , with the third test taking place tonight . 
Harry folded the newspaper , saying gently : 
She was aiming for a little , okay ? 
On the other side of the Slytherin table , the Malfoys , Crabbe and Goyle were laughing at it , typing their fingers on their heads , making ridiculous crazy faces , and sticking their tongues out like snakes . 
Said Ron : 
How did she know that the scar of pain in the study of prophecy ? 
She can not be there , nor does she have a story to listen to 
Harry said : 
Window opened , I opened the window to breathe a little . 
Hermione said : 
You were at the top of the North Tower ! 
Your voice can not come down to the school grounds . 
Harry said : 
Well , you are the person assigned to study the method of snooping magic . 
So you tell us what she did . 
Hermione said : 
I'm trying ! 
But me 
A strange dream appeared on Hermione's face . 
She slowly raised a hand and tapped her fingers on her hair . 
Ron looked at Hermione nervously : 
Do you ? 
Hermione said , 
No problem ? 
She ran her fingers through her hair , and then reached for her mouth , as if speaking an invisible pocket recorder ; Harry and Ron glared at each other . 
Hermione stared at the space in front of her and said , 
I have an idea . 
I thought I knew because no one could see even Moody and she could have climbed over the window but she was not allowed to be allowed to think that she was the only one . she is ! 
I just need a library for two minutes - to be sure ! 
After saying this , Hermione grabbed her bag and darted like an arrow out of the hall . 
Ron called with her : 
HEY ! 
In ten minutes we have to take the History of magic that home ! 
Ron returned to Harry : 
Hurricane , Hermione must really hate Rita bones to dare to delay a test . 
What will you do in Mr. Binns class ? 
Read again ? 
As a champion , Harry was exempt from the final exams , so every time he went to the examinations , Harry sat at the back of the class looking for additional magic spells for his third exam . 
Harry said to Ron : 
Maybe . 
But then Professor McGonagall came in , walking along the Gryffindor table toward Harry . 
She said : 
Potter , the champions will meet in the room outside the main hall after breakfast . 
But tonight started the third exam that she ! 
You know that . 
Potter à . 
You know , the families of the champions are invited to see the final exam of the competition . This is just a chance for me to meet greeting that person . 
Professor walked away . 
Harry gaped at her . 
It says : 
Co did not expect the Dursleys to come here , right ? 
Said Ron : 
Do not know . 
But Harry , I have to hurry up here , I'm late for Mr. Binns exam . 
Meet you back home . 
Harry ate his breakfast in the empty hall . 
He saw Fleur Delacour stand up on the other side of the Ravenclaw table and join Cerdic across the hall to the side room and enter it together . 
Just a moment later , Krum raised his shoulder to join the other two . 
Harry was still sitting in his seat . 
She did not want to go to that room . 
It does not have a family . Anyway , there will not be any relatives coming here to risk it . 
But as he stood up , thinking that it was worth the library to get more information about the magic spells , the door on the side of the hall opened , and Cerdic stuck his head out . 
Harry , come here , they're waiting for you . 
Harry got up , embarrassed , unable to express himself . Could the Dursley family have come here ? 
He crossed the hall to open the door of the meeting room . 
Cerdic and his cheeks sat right in the door . 
Viktor Krum sat in the corner over there , chatting with his black - cheeked father and his father in Bulgarian . 
Krum apparently inherited his father's bait . 
On the other side of the room was Fleur , who was talking in French with her mother . 
Fleur's sister , Gabrielle , was holding her hand . 
She raised her hand and waved Harry , and Harry waved his hand back and smiled . 
And then Harry saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace , smiling at him . 
Harry grinned , reaching for them , Mrs. Weasley said excitedly . 
Surprised too ! 
Is it possible that you came here to watch the competition , Harry ? 
She bent down and kissed Harry on the cheek . 
Bill grinned at Harry and shook his hand : 
Are you fine ? 
Charlie wants to come too , but he can not find the time . 
Photo said you conquered the tail - Gai Hungary can not believe it . 
Harry noticed that her Fleur Delacour kept looking over his mother's shoulders watching him Bill seemed very interested . 
Harry could tell she had no objection to long hair or curls in her fangs . 
Harry shuddered at Mrs. Weasley : 
Uncle is good . 
Have you thought of the Dursleys ? 
Mrs. Weasley pouted : 
Hứ . 
She always tried to refrain from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry , but her eyes went up whenever she heard them . 
Bill looked around the room ( Mrs. Violet , Ms . Be's friend , winked at Bill from her picture ) . 
He did not have the opportunity to visit the old school for five years . 
The picture of the crazy knight is here ? 
Mr. Cadogan ? 
Harry had met Mr. Cadogan last year , he exclaimed : 
Ah , still . 
Bill asked again : 
And Mrs. Beo ? 
Ms . Weasley said : 
Back to school was to see Mrs. Be here . 
One time he returned to the bedroom at four in the morning , Mrs. Beo stood outside until morning 
Bill looked at his surprise , he probe : 
What do you do outside the bedroom at four in the morning ? 
Mrs. Weasley laughs , her eyes blinking : 
Mama with three children walking at night . 
Three children were caught by Prison Apollyon - then Pringle was the supervisor - his father was still exposed - it . 
Bill said : 
You led us to a visit to Harry ! 
Yes , yes ! 
Harry said earnestly . 
Everyone went back to the door to the Great Hall . 
As Harry walked past Mr. Amos Diggory , he looked back : 
That's it ? 
He looked at Harry from head to toe . 
I still do not feel satisfied when Cerdic still scores with me , right ? 
Harry asked : 
What is that ? 
Cerdic lowered his voice to Harry : 
Do not pay attention to your dad . 
From the reading of Rita Skeeter's articles on the Magic Trilogy , my daddy knew that , she wrote as if she were the only champion of Hogwarts . 
When Mr. Amos Diggory started to go out with Bill and Mrs. Weasley , he said loud enough to let Harry hear : 
It does not matter , right ? 
Still , I ' ll tell her , too , Cerdic ? 
I've beaten him a beat , right ? 
Mrs. Weasley said , 
Rita has gone too far in trouble , Mr. Amos . 
I thought you had to know that , you worked in the Ministry of Magic ! 
Mr. Diggory seemed to say something outrageous , but his wife put a hand on his arm , and he just shrugged and turned away . 
Harry headed for an exciting morning in the sunshine with Bill and Mrs. Weasley , showing them the Beauxbatons and the Durmstrang . 
Mrs. Weasley was planted by the Willow Roi , which was planted only after she graduated and throughout her memory remembered his predecessor Hagrid , an old man called Ogg . 
As the three walked around the glass - enclosed building , Harry asked , 
How is Percy ? 
Bill said : 
Not Ok . 
Mrs. Weasley lowered her voice and looked around : 
He was very upset . 
The Magician wanted to keep Crouch's disappearance secret , but Percy was left unmoved by questions about the instructions Crouch had sent him . 
It seems they think the instructions are not really written by Crouch . 
Percy was just too stressed . 
They did not give it a replacement for Crouch's fifth in the competition tonight . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge will do it . 
Harry , Bill and Mrs. Weasley return to the castle . 
Mama ! 
Mr. Bill ! 
Ron was shocked when he sat at the Gryffindor table : 
What are you doing here ? 
Ms . Weasley beamed , 
Let's see Harry play the final game , but what to do ? 
Mums have to say that there is a chance to change the atmosphere well , not to cook . 
How's your test ? 
Said Ron : 
Ah well 
It is impossible to remember the names of the reptilian goblins , so I made a mess . 
That's fine . 
Mrs. Weasley's face tightened , and Ron took a bite of his own , and said , 
All the goblins have names like Bodrod Beard or Something Urg , so naming them is not very difficult . 
Fred , George , and Ginny also came to sit next to him , and Harry enjoyed the moment of happiness as if he were living back to his days at the Burrow Farm . 
He forgot my anxiety about my test . 
And until Hermione appeared in the middle of lunch , Harry remembered that Hermione was having a headache because of Rita Skeeter . 
You are going to tell us 
Hermione shook her head vigilantly , eyes glancing at Mrs. Weasley . 
Mrs. Weasley said to Hermione in an unusually dry voice : 
Hello Hermione . 
Hermione smiled at Mrs. Weasley's cold expression . 
She replies : 
Hi . 
Harry looked between them and said , 
Uncle Weasley , you do not believe the garbage that Rita wrote on the Sorcerer's Week , do not you ? 
Hermione is not my friend . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
Oh , no ! 
Of course I do not believe . 
Later Mrs. Weasley was more intimate with Hermione . 
Harry , Bill and Mrs. Weasley walked around the castle for noon , then returned to the hall for the afternoon party . 
Cornelius Fudge and Ludo Bagman were at the teacher's table . 
Mr Bagman was very excited , but Mr Fudge , sitting beside Mrs Maxime , was serious and did not speak . 
Maxime was concentrating on her plate , and Harry saw her eyes look red . 
Hagrid glanced around her along the table . 
There were more dishes than usual , but Harry was beginning to feel nervous , not eating well . 
As the ceiling of the spell above its head began to shift from blue to dark purple , Dumbledore stood up from the teacher's desk . 
Everybody , shut up . 
Ladies and gentlemen , in five minutes I will invite you to step over to the Quidditch field to witness the final test of the Triwizard Tournament . 
Now invite the Bagman champions to go down to the stadium . 
Harry stood up . 
All the Gryffindors sitting around the table clapped their hands . 
The Weasley brothers and Hermione wish it good luck , and when it comes out of the hall along with Cerdic , Fleur and Krum . 
As they walked down the stone steps , Mr. Bagman asked , 
Are you okay , Harry ? 
Heart not ? 
Harry replied , 
I'm fine . 
Saying so is true ; Harry was nervous , but when he went to the stadium , he kept reminding himself of the spells he had practiced , and the sense that he could remember all that made him feel . Much better 
Mr. Bagman and the four champions entered the stadium - which is now completely unrecognizable . 
The hedge is higher than six meters running across the ball field . 
Right in front of their eyes is a gap : that is the entrance to the maze . 
The corridor behind the entrance looked gloomy to the hair of the head . 
Five minutes later , the stands began to fill ; The atmosphere was filled with the excitement of chatting and the treading footsteps of hundreds of students in the seats . 
The sky is now in chasm and the first stars have begun to appear . 
Hagrid , Professor Moody , Professor McGonagall , and Professor Flitwick are entering the stadium , approaching Bagman and the others . 
Everybody wears a big red star on his hat , all wearing a hat , except for Hagrid , who wears a star on his moor . 
Professor McGonagall told the champions : 
We will patrol outside the maze . 
If the game is difficult and needs to be rescued , throw light red in the air , one of us will come to rescue , the game is clear ? 
The champions nodded . 
Mr. Bagman said cheerfully to the four supervisors : 
Then you go ! 
Hagrid whispered : 
Good luck listening to Harry ! 
Then he and the other three left , in different directions , to their guard around the maze . 
Then Bagman just point his wand at his throat , murmuring : 
Sonorus ! 
And a magically enhanced voice echoed throughout the stands : 
Ladies and gentlemen , the third and final test of the Trilogy is about to begin . 
Please allow me to repeat the current score of the contestants ! 
At the top of the table are Cerdic Diggory and Harry Potter , each with eighty - five points . 
Both are Hogwarts students ! 
The applause and cheers cheered the whole forest so that the birds in the forest swept up , in the dark sky . 
The second is Viktor Krum of Durmstrang Academy , with eighty points ! 
Again a loud applause . 
And in the third place is the Fleur Delacour of the Beauxbatons academy . 
Harry noticed Mrs. Weasley , Bill , Ron , and Hermione in the middle of the hall clapping enthusiastically at Fleur . 
Harry waved at them , and they waved to him , beaming . 
Mr. Bagman said : 
So hear my whistle , Cerdic , Harry ! 
Three two one ! 
He blew a short whistle , and Cerdic and Harry hurried into the maze . 
The hawkers huddled down the dim shadows down the aisle ; And either because the beaks were too high and too thick , or because they were spellcasted , when the champions came into the maze , the sound of the crowd around them immediately ceased . 
Harry felt as though he was at the bottom of the water again . 
He withdrew his wand , murmuring : 
Lumos ! 
He heard Cerdic behind him doing the same . 
After going about fifty yards , they reached a fork . 
Both look at each other . 
Harry told Cerdic : 
See you later . 
Then it goes to the left , Cerdic to the right . 
Harry heard Bagman's whistle blowing up the second time . 
Krum entered the maze . 
Harry stepped up . 
The way it seems seems completely deserted . 
He turned right , step up , holding the wand over his head , trying to look ahead as far as possible . 
But not see anything . 
Mr. Bagman's siren sounded a third time , sounding far away . 
So all the four champions have already entered the maze . 
Harry stared back at him . 
The old feeling is that it is being watched . 
As the minutes passed , the sky above was darker and darker , and the maze darkened and darkened . 
Harry went to the second fork . 
Harry placed the wand on the palm of his hand , whispering to his wand : 
Point me ! ( Only me ! ) 
The wand turns around and turns to the right , just in the thickened hedge . 
That direction is north , and it knows it needs to go northwest to reach the center of the maze . The best thing to do is to follow the path on the left and when possible turn around . 
The road ahead was empty , and when Harry went to a turn and turned right , he noticed it was a pumpkin . 
Harry did not know why , but he was worried that there had been no obstacle until now . Should it meet something right now ? 
It feels like the maze is cheating on it with a false sense of security . Harry suddenly heard something moving 
live in the back . 
Now the wand came out , ready to attack , but the light of the wand revealed a Cerdic hurrying out of the path on the side of his face . 
Cerdic looks trembling scary . 
His sleeveless shirt was sighing . 
Cerdic hissed . 
Hagrid's Haunted Flaming Shrimp ! 
They are terrible he just escaped ! 
Cerdic shook his head and ran away , hidden in a different path . 
Harry rushed to extend the gap between him and the Monsters . 
Then , just as he turned at a turn , he noticed an Azkaban guard coming toward him . 
He was nearly four meters tall , his face sealed under the hood , his scaly hand rotting forward , fluttering toward him . 
Harry could hear the whining breath of the Azkaban dementor ; He felt the cold chill in his body , but he knew what to do 
Harry stirred up the happiest of thoughts he could think of , concentrating all his energy on the thought that he would overcome the maze and celebrate the victory with Ron and Hermione . 
He raised his wand , shouting : 
Expecto Patronum ! ( Meaning : Soul Soul Guard ! ) 
A silver deer pops out of Harry's wand , dashing towards the dementor , causing him to fall backwards and stumble into his hybrid shirt . So far Harry has never seen a fallen Azkaban Drowned . so . 
It shouted : 
Wait ! 
You are Mr. Kook ! 
Harry walked over , followed his guardian spirit , and read the mantra : 
Riddikulus ! ( Meaning : Oddity ! ) 
A loud explosion resounded , and his son caught up with a muffled whip . 
The silver deer also disappears . 
Harry wants the deer to stay with him a bit more , so that he has a good companion . But it goes on alone , very quickly and quietly , listening attentively , wand again again . out front . 
Left back leftHai times he found himself going blind dead . 
He reads the Four Points mantra and realizes it has gone too far east . 
He turned back , turned right , and saw a strange yellowish mist that was floating in front of him . 
Harry cautiously went forward , launching the wand's light into the mist . 
This looks like something spell , it wonders whether to blast it to open the way that no . 
It shouted : 
Reducto ! 
The spell hits the mist , through it , and the fog is not affected . 
He thought it would have to learn more , the spell can only be used to destroy the solid object . 
If it goes through the mist , what happens ? 
Is it worth the risk , or is it backward ? 
It was still hesitating , a scream broke the silence . 
Harry screamed : 
Fleur ? 
Only silence . 
He glanced around . What happened to that girl ? 
Her scream sounded like it was coming from somewhere in front of Harry . 
He took a deep breath and ran through the fog . 
The world turned upside down . 
Harry hangs upwards , his hair pointing to the ground , his eyes glazed out , his eyes fluttering into the bottomless sky . 
It holds the glasses at the tip of the nose and holds them tightly there , filled with horror . 
Harry felt as though his feet were stuck to the grass , and the grass was now the ceiling . 
Underneath it now is the black sky shining through the stars extending to infinity . 
It felt as though if he tried to move his leg , it would fall off the ground completely . 
Harry thought to himself . 
Its blood flowed to its head . 
Think 
He never practiced a mantra to fight the reversion of the earth and the sky . 
Should it be the one to move the vacuum ? 
He listened to blood on his head , his pulse throbbing in his ear . 
There are two options for this : try to unmask this , or red light in the air to call for help , and considered removed from the contest after being rescued . 
He closed his eyes , so that he could not see the infinite space beneath his feet , and pulled his right leg upward from the grass ceiling . 
Immediately the world returned to the old order . 
Harry fell forward , his knees bent to the ground firmly . 
He felt paralyzed for a moment because of a tremor . 
Then he took a long , deep and strong breath , then stood up again , hurrying to go ahead , just looking back to the yellow fog that it was running away from damage . 
Under the moonlight , innocent mist glinted innocently . 
Harry stopped at a crossroad , where the two roads meet and look around for some sign of Fleur . 
It was certainly Fleur who had screamed before . 
What did she meet ? 
Does she have peace ? 
There was no red light in the air - so was she able to solve the problem herself ? 
Or was it too difficult for Fleur to reach the wand to signal for help ? 
Harry turned to the right , feeling more and more restless ... but at the same time , he could not help but think : a champion was eliminated ... 
The cup is nearby , and it sounds like Fleur is no longer in the race . 
Do not know how far it has gone ? 
What if it really won ? 
For the first time since he suddenly became a champion , he quickly saw the image of himself , holding up the triumvirate cup in front of all the students at the school . 
For ten minutes Harry had not encountered any obstacles , but he kept his head down . 
Twice it was a mistake . 
Finally , he found a new path and started jogging along this road , the light from his wand shining shining and flickering on the high walls . 
Then he turned another round and saw in his face a tailed Shrike . 
Cerdic is right : it is a giant tailed Shrew . 
About three feet longer , the tail was more like a scorpion than anything else . 
Its long curved bent to the back . 
His armor sparkled under the light of Harry's wand . 
Stupefy ! ( meaning : dead stand ! ) 
The curse touches the armor of the tailed Shrike and bounces back . 
Harry fell in time to avoid it , but he also smelled his scorching scent . 
The curse had scorched the top of Harry's head . 
The Tailed Shrike from its tail a bomb blast flew toward Harry . 
Impedimenta ! ( Meaning : Stop ! ) 
Harry screamed . 
The spell hits the creature's armor again and pops up again . 
Harry staggered a few steps and fell to the ground . 
IMPEDIMENT ! 
The tailed Shrike is only a few inches away from where it was when he died . - Harry finally cast a spell on the abdomen without the protective armor of the Shrike . 
He gasps , Harry lifts himself away from the monster and runs back in the opposite direction . - Curse of inhibition has no permanent effect , only in a moment , the monster can recover and use . re - use some of its legs . 
Harry follows the path to the left and falls into the alley ; it's back on the right path , also hit the dead end . 
Harry had to stop , his heart pounding . 
Again it uses the Four Point Mantra , returns to its original location , chooses a path leading it to the northwest . 
Harry ran along the road for a few minutes and heard something running parallel to the sound of his foot on the road , and he stood still . 
Cerdic's voice screams : 
What are you doing here ? 
What are you trying to do ? 
And Harry heard Krum's voice : 
Crucio ! 
The space filled with Cerdic's screams . 
Aghast . 
Harry ran wildly on the way , trying to cross Cerdic's path . 
But there seems to be no way . 
He tried the Curse of the Spell , the effect was not very satisfactory , but also created a small hole in the wall of the tree so that Harry could penetrate his legs , stepping on the branches , until the creation . into a hole large enough to get it hard to get through , raking the robes . 
He looked to his right , saw Cerdic writhing on the ground , Krum standing on top of him . 
Harry straightened up , pointing his wand over Krum just as Krum looked up . 
Krum turned and ran . 
But Harry shouted : 
Stupefy ! The mantra struck Krum in the back . 
He stood in the middle of the road , falling down , lying motionless , face down grass . 
Harry rushed to Cerdic's side , with convulsions and writhing , with only a panting breath , his hands on his face . 
Harry pulled Cerdic's arm , saying curtly : 
You OK ? 
Cerdic gasped : 
Yes ... 
yes ... I believe ... he crawled from behind him ... he heard his voice , he turned around , and he pointed his wand at me ... 
Cerdic stood up . 
It is still trembling . 
The two look at Krum . 
Harry glared at Krum , saying : 
I can not believe this story ... I thought he was good too . 
Cerdic says : 
I think so too . 
Harry asked : 
Have you heard Fleur scream ? 
Cerdic says : 
Yes . 
Do you think Krum has eradicated her ? 
Harry slowly replied : 
I do not know . 
Cerdic murmured : 
Should I leave him here ? 
Harry said : 
Should not . 
I think we should shoot up without a flash of red light . 
Someone will come and take him out of here ... not alone he can be the giant tailed Shrike like to play . 
Cerdic grunted : 
He should be very . 
Say that . 
But Cerdic also raised his wand and fired a beam of red light into the air , a beam of light flashing over Krum , marking where he lay . 
Harry and Cerdic stood there in the dark for a moment , looking around . 
Then Cerdic said : 
Oh ... you think we should continue ... 
Harry said : 
What ? 
Yeah ... yeah ... right ... 
This is a strange moment . 
Harry and Cerdic have teamed up against Krum for a moment - now realize that Harry is the two of them rivals . 
Two people rush back up the dark road without saying anything , then Harry turns left , and Cerdic turn right . 
Sooner or later Cerdic's footsteps fade and disappear . 
Harry continued to go , continuing to use the Four Points to make sure he was on the right track . 
The cup now lies between Harry and Cerdic . 
At this moment , the desire to be the first to win the Cup is burning more fiercely than ever in Harry's heart , but it is also hard to believe what he just saw Krum do . 
The use of the Unable to Forbear for a human is also meant to be imprisoned in Azkaban Prison , Moody has said so . 
Certainly Krum was too desirous of winning the Triumvirate Cup ... 
Harry thought as he ran quickly . 
It stuck in the head of the dull road , but the darkening path made Harry firmly close to the maze center . 
And then , as he strode down a long , straight path , he saw the movement . 
The light from its wand shines on a strange creature , a creature that was previously only seen in the picture , in the Monster Beast . 
It is the Sphinx . 
It has the body of a huge lion , legs full of scary scary , and the golden tail is at the bottom with a brown cap . 
However , its head is the head of a woman . 
She turned her almond - shaped eyes toward Harry as he approached . 
Harry raised his wand , hesitating . 
The sphinx did not seem to be ready to masturbate , but she kept on pushing back and blocking her way . 
Later , she said , deep , husky voice : 
You have come very close to the goal . 
The fastest way is to pass me . 
So please stay away from the road . 
Harry said before knowing the answer would be : no . 
The hermit continued to walk , saying : 
Are not . 
I will not pass the game unless the answer to my quiz . 
Correct answer , I let go . 
Wrong answer , I hit . 
Keeping silent , I let go of peace . 
Harry's stomach sped up a few more . 
This deafening puzzle is that Hermione is an excellent person , not her . 
He considered his luck . 
If it is too difficult , it may silence unanswered , turn away the sphinx , go to nothing , and try to find another way to the maze center . 
It says : 
OK . 
Please let me hear the riddle . 
The Sphinx sat down in the middle of the road , chirping : 
Think of the one who lives in disguise , 
He deals in secrecy and just lied to me . 
Then tell us what is always the last remodeling 
In between the middle and the end ? 
And finally give us the sound that is often heard 
Throughout the search for the word hard to find . 
Now tie them together , and answer this . 
Which creature does not want to kiss ? 
Harry gasped at the Sphinx . 
He hesitated : 
Can I ... listen to it again ... a bit slower . 
The Spider winked at Harry , smiled , and recited the poem . 
Harry bald : 
Are all the suggestions on a subject that I do not want to kiss ? 
Sphinx just smiled a mysterious smile . 
Harry regarded that smile as a nod . 
Harry asked his head for a try . 
There are piles of creatures that no one wants to kiss . The first thought of it as the Monster Shrimp under it , but it's a hunch that's not the answer . 
It must follow the clues suggested by the verse above ... 
Harry stared at the Sphinx and mumbled : 
A fake ... just lie ... it must be a flame . 
No , that's not my answer yet ! 
A ... spy ? 
I will return this idea after ... 
Please repeat the second suggestion ! 
Sphinx read the next verse . 
Harry repeated : 
last remodeling 
Uh ... can not understand ... ' between the middle ' ... please let me hear the last suggestion , okay ? 
The Savior recites the last four verses . 
Harry muttered : 
The sound is usually heard during the search for the word hard to find . 
' Eh ... that's ... to ... 
oh .... the sound ... 
Oh ! 
Sphinx smiled at him . 
Harry walks thoughtful : 
Spy ... 
cockroaches 
oh ... 
cockroach . 
The creature I do not want to kiss ... spider ! 
The Sphinx smiled , his broad smile reaching his ear . 
She got up , stretched her legs out , and then stood aside to let Harry pass . 
Harry was too surprised at his lucid intelligence , said two hours rush : 
Thank you ! 
Then dart like an arrow to the front . 
It must have come close to the target now , it was close ... 
Harry's wand tells him he is on the right track ; If it does not meet something too horrible , then it will have a chance ... 
Harry run zone . 
There are several ways to choose . 
He whispered to the wand : 
Point me ! 
Turn left and turn right . 
Harry rushes into the street and sees the light in front . 
The Magic Triangle was shining on a pedestal about a hundred yards from Harry . 
Suddenly from a road in front it jumped out a black figure . 
It's Cerdic , he's heading for the Cup first . 
Cerdic was running all the way to the cup , and Harry knew it was impossible to catch up . 
Cerdic taller than it is , legs much longer than its legs ... 
Then Harry saw something big on the left hand wall , moving very fast along the path that crossed the path it was going through . 
It moved so fast that Cerdic nearly collided . 
But Cerdic was staring at the cup , not seeing anything . 
Harry screamed : 
Cerdic ! 
Watch out , on his left it ! 
Cerdic turned his head just in time , dodging the object , avoiding a fierce bump , but in a rush , Cerdic slipped . 
Harry saw Cerdic's wand fly out of his hand , just as a huge spider slammed across the street and started slamming down Cerdic . 
Stupefy ! 
Harry screamed . 
Its spell hits directly the black hairs of the giant spider , but the effect of such action is like throwing a spider - like stone ; The spider tugged at one , rushed back , and flew to attack Harry . 
Stupefy ! Impedimenta ! Stupefy ! But not at all . 
This spider is either too big , or it is magical , so Harry's spell is not sacred , only to provoke the monster up . 
Harry looked at the eight dark eyes shining with razor sharpness and pointed razor - sharp in front of him . 
Harry was lifted up into the air with his spider's forelimbs . 
He struggled like crazy , kicked his legs , his legs caught in his thighs , and only moments later he heard numbness . 
Harry heard Cerdic scream : 
Stupefy ! 
But Cerdic's mantra is no more sacred than Harry's mantra . 
Harry pointed at the wand of the spider as he came out again , and shouted : 
Expelliarmus ! 
This means that Harry was dropped from a height of nearly four meters , pinning it on his injured leg , causing it to slip . 
Unable to stop to think , Harry pointed the wand directly to the spider's abdomen , as it did to the Shrike and shouted : 
Stupefy ! 
At the same time , Cerdic shouted . 
And two synergies do what one can not do . 
The spider dashed aside , crushed a nearby hedge and scattered a tangle of fur on the road . 
Harry listened to Cerdic : Harry ! 
Are you okay ? 
Did it hit you ? 
Harry replied in a sigh of relief : 
Are not ! 
Harry looked down at his leg . 
It is bleeding . 
Harry saw something thick and sticky from the spider's lateral pair that had torn his robes . 
Harry tried to stand up , but his legs were trembling and now he did not support his weight . 
Harry leaned against the fence , opened his mouth to breathe , and looked around . 
Cerdic was standing at the foot of the pedestal for the Magic Triangle . 
The cup shines behind Cerdic . 
Harry gasped with Cerdic : 
Take it , take it , you've arrived . 
But Cerdic did not budge . 
He just stood there , looking at Harry . 
Then he turned to stare at the Cup . 
Harry saw Cerdic's longing in the golden light of the cup . 
Cerdic turned to look at Harry again . 
Harry was standing on the brink of standing up . 
Cerdic took a deep breath . 
Take it . 
You deserve to be the winner . 
I have saved your life here twice . 
Harry said : 
This happened so no one was expecting . 
It feels angry ; Its legs hurt , and it hurt all over the body by attempting to eject the spider , and after all that effort it was defeated by Cerdic , as Cerdic defeated it at the invitation of Cho Chang . Make you dance in the ball . 
It says : 
Whoever gets to the first cup gets points . 
That person is you . 
I told you I can not beat any race with this leg . 
Cerdic took a few steps away from the cup , approached the unconscious spider , shook his head : 
Are not . 
Harry is hot : 
Do not be noble . 
Take it , then we can get out of here . 
Cerdic looked at Harry adjusting himself , still clinging to the hedge . 
Cerdic says : 
I told you about the dragon . 
If you did not tell me what was going to happen , you would have dropped the radio right from the first test . 
Harry tried to wipe the blood on his leg with his lapel , choking back : 
I was helped by him again . 
He helped me with the egg . 
Cerdic says : 
The egg was his help . 
Harry said : 
We still pull . 
He cautiously checked his leg : his trembling feet trembled as he struggled with the weight of his body , and he had ankled his ankles as the giant spider fell on him . 
Cerdic insisted : 
I should have scored more on the second exam . 
I stayed to save all the hostages . 
He should have done that too . 
Harry bitterly said : 
You are the only fool that believe in that song ! 
Please take the trophy ! 
Cerdic says : 
Are not ! 
He walked over the spider's feet on the ground to stand beside Harry . 
Harry glared at Cerdic . 
He's honest . 
He is rejecting the glory that the Hufflepuff has never had in centuries . 
Cerdic says : 
Fighting ! 
Cerdic looked to say this , as if he had exhausted his guts , but his expression was determined , his hands folded , as if he had decided decisively . 
Harry looked at Cerdic and saw the cup . 
In a moment of glory , Harry saw the picture of him holding the cup running out of the maze . 
He saw it lift up the triangular cup , heard the roar of the crowd , saw Cho Chang's face light up admiration , and he saw that admiration more clearly than ever and then that image fainted , he realized that he was still staring at Cerdic's stubborn face hidden in the darkness . 
Harry said : 
We both grab the trophy . 
What ? 
Let's take it for a while . That's still the victory of Hogwarts . 
We're in the same category . 
Cerdic stared at Harry , dropping his hands . 
Are you sure ? 
Harry said : 
Sure . 
Oh we have helped each other in misery , right ? 
We both get here . 
So we got the Cup together . 
For a moment , Cerdic looked as if he could not believe his ears . 
Then Cerdic's face flashed a smile . 
I said : 
You're right . 
Come here ! 
Cerdic held Harry's arm , wrapped around his shoulders , and helped Harry claw to the cupboard . 
When they arrived , they both held out their hands , each clutching one of the straps of the glittering Cup . 
Harry said : 
Count to the third , pick up the house . 
One two Three 
Harry and Cerdic clutched the cup , lifting up . 
Immediately Harry felt a sharp throb behind his belly button . 
Its legs are lifted off the ground . 
She could not let go of the handle of the Cup of Magic ; the Cup itself pulls it up in a howling wind and the scene turns spooky ; Cerdic also flew up beside it . 
Chapter 32 BLOOD , MEAT , AND BONE 
Harry suddenly saw his feet pounding against the ground ; His injured leg collapsed , and he fell forward ; Finally , let go of the Triangle Cup , raise his head and ask : 
Where are we ? 
Cerdic shook his head . 
He got up , pulled Harry up , and both looked around . 
They were completely off the Hogwarts campus ; and certainly has gone far - perhaps hundreds of miles - because even the mountains surrounding the castle are nowhere to be found . 
Instead , they are standing on a darkened parade ground , to the right of which is a tall yew tree and far away from the shadow of a small church . 
To the left they emerged a hill . 
Harry can only recognize the shape of a small cottage on the hillside . 
Cerdic looked down at the Magic Triangle and looked at Harry again . 
He asked : 
Who told me this Cup is a Port Lock ? 
Are not . 
Harry answered . 
He was looking around the graveyard . 
Absolutely silent and slightly disgusting . 
Is this also considered part of the test ? 
Cerdic said : 
I do not know . 
Cerdic looks worried : 
Do you want to withdraw your wand ? 
Candlestick . 
Harry said , but it was Cerdic himself who suggested this instead . 
The two removed their wands . 
Harry continued to look around . 
It feels like being watched . 
Harry blurted out : 
Is anyone going ? 
With their eyes fixed on the darkness , they saw a shadow approaching , moving freely among the tombs toward them . 
Harry did not see the face clearly , but by the way he was standing , he was probably holding something in his hand . 
I do not know who it is , just know it's low , wearing a hooded jacket that covers the face . 
And - the more he walked , the more distance between them and the more he recaptured - did Harry find the object in his hand like a baby or was it just a wrapper ? 
Harry slightly lowered his wand and glanced at Cerdic . 
He threw a scornful look at it . 
Then they both went back to watching the shadow approaching . 
The shadow stopped at a marble tombstone six feet taller than them . 
For a split second , Harry , Cerdic , and the dwarf shadowed each other . 
And then , unexpectedly , Harry's scar was intense . 
Its life has never been so painful ; the wand slipped off his fingers as he raised his hand to his face ; its knees collapse ; he knelt on the ground and saw nothing ; its head like to crack out . 
He heard far and wide , above his head , a sharp voice : 
Kill that guy ! A rustle and another voice , hissing in the darkness : 
Avada Kedavra ! 
A flash of blue flashes in Harry's eyes , and he hears something heavy fall to the ground next to it . 
Its scar is so sick that it makes it nauseous , and then it feels less painful . 
He opened his spicy eyes , frightened by what he had just seen : 
Cerdic lay on the ground , his arms wide as eagles . 
Cerdic is dead . 
In an almost endless moment , Harry stared at Cerdic's face , his gray eyes , as empty and lifeless as the window of a deserted house , Cerdic's mouth half open , seemingly a little shocked . . 
And then , when Harry had not yet believed in what he saw , when it was still puzzling , he suddenly felt a strong pull at his feet . 
The short - haired man dropped the package under his feet , lit up his wand , and was holding Harry toward the marble tombstone . 
In the light of the wand , Harry could see the name of the wand , even before it was drawn close to his head . TOM RIDDLE 
The man in the cloak now lashed out at the ropes , tied Harry to the tombstone , from his neck down to his elbow . 
Harry heard the panting gasp , hurrying from the hood . 
It struggled , and the man hit it - hit it with one finger . 
Harry recognized who was under the hood . 
It is the worm's tail . 
It screams : 
Turns out that mi ! 
But the tail of Worm , then tied it finished , not answer . 
He was busy checking the ropes for sure , his fingers clawing at the gut . 
It was certain that Harry had been tied to a tombstone , unable to budge a compost , and the tail of Worm pulled out a long black cloth and jammed it into Harry's mouth . 
Then , without saying a single word , he turned away and rushed away . 
Harry could not even see his tail , he could not see his tail , because he could not turn his head to look behind the stela ; It only sees what is in front of it . 
Cerdic's body is about twenty feet away . 
Nearby is the Magic Triangle Cup , located under the stars . 
Harry's wand lay on the ground , just below Cerdic's feet . 
The package of scarves that Harry once thought was a baby was approaching , at the foot of the grave . 
That thing seems to provoke irritation . 
Harry looked at him , and his scar hurt again and suddenly he realized he did not want to know what was in that package that he did not want the heel open . 
He heard a noise at his feet . 
He looked down and saw a giant snake crawl over the grass , then curled around the stela that was tied to it . 
The sudden whirring of the worm's tail resounded . 
Looks like he's trying to push something heavy on the ground . 
Then he appeared in Harry's sight , and Harry realized he was pushing a rock cauldron to the grave's feet . 
In the cauldron of something that looks like water - Harry heard the waves in it - that cauldron was bigger than any of the cauldrons Harry used ; It was a large stone pot that was full enough for an adult to sit in . 
The thing in the scarf on the ground seemed even more agitated , as if it was trying to come out . 
Then the tail of the worm was at the bottom of the cauldron with the wand . 
Extinguish fire from beneath the cauldron . 
The giant snake slipped away in the darkness . 
The liquid in the cauldron seems to heat up very quickly . 
The water is not only boiling , but also glows like a burning forest . 
The water rose up billowing , blurring the shape of the worm's tail is fire . 
The towel pile is more agitated . 
And Harry heard the cold voice : 
Hurry up ! 
The surface of the water is now brightly lit , as if there were diamonds on it . 
Dear master , is ready . 
Then 
The voice was cold . 
The worm pulled open the towel bag on the ground , revealing the top , and Harry popped up a scream , but was blocked by the cloth . 
The Wormtail is as heavy as a large stone , and in its sheath there is something ugly , slimy , and blind - but horrible , a hundred times more horrible . 
The thing that Wormtail brings with it is the shape of a baby sitting on a rope . 
Do not have hair , but it looks like scaly , moldy and reddish . 
His limbs were sickly , and his face - flattened , like a snake's head , with two red eyes . 
The thing seemed weak , needing help , he put his weak arms up , wrapped around his necks , and lifted him up to the cauldron . 
When he did this , the hat fell back , and Harry saw the look of terror on his pale , pale face by the fire . 
At the same time , Harry saw the ugly , ugly face illuminated by the sparks dancing on the water in the cauldron . 
And then the worm pulls the creature in the cauldron ; a hissing sound , and it disappeared under the water . 
Harry heard a small noise as the weakened body touched the bottom of the cauldron . 
May it be drowned , Harry thought , his scar was so hot that he could barely breathe , drowning it to death . 
Worm's tail is talking . 
His voice trembled ; Looks like he's scared . 
He raised his wand , closed his eyes , said to the darkness : 
Bones of the father , let go of accidentally , will heal me ! 
The grave at Harry's feet cracked open . 
Terrified , Harry watched a thin stream of dust rise as Voldemort's vow and lightly fell in the cauldron . 
Water surface diamonds hissed and burst into sparkling splashes everywhere and changed into a brilliant blue , shivering . 
And now Worm's tail was moaning . 
He pulled out a long , thin silver knife from his cloak . 
He said as he sobbed , choked : 
The meat of my servant willingly surrendered to his master , who will be resurrected . 
He spread his right hand in front of him . 
His left hand gripped the dagger and swung up . 
For a second , Harry realized that the worm's tail was about to do - he tried to close his eyes , but he could not stop the big screams through the dark night , through him , as if he were the knife himself . crashing . 
He heard the sound of falling to the ground , listening to the tail of the worm , and then it was a loud crash , as if something had been left untouched . 
Harry did not look any longer but the poison turned red , its light piercing Harry's closed eyelids . 
The tail gasped and moaned in pain . 
Harry knew that the worm's tail was right in front of him , no need to wait until he felt his panic in his face . 
Your enemy's strength will be revived by enemies . 
Harry struggled in tight ropes ; he looked down and saw the shining silver knife tremble in the other hand of the worm's tail . 
He felt the tip of the knife hit his right elbow and the blood flowed through his torn sleeve . Worm tail , still gasping for pain , groping in his pocket to take a small glass jar , to Harry's wound to catch the blood flowing . 
He turned back to the cauldron and took Harry's blood . 
The water in it turns white . 
Finishing work , the worm's tail knelt down the cauldron , then lay out on one side of the ground , hugged arms bleeding bleeding , moaning and sobbing . 
The cauldron is bubbling and boiling , diamond flashes in all directions , brightens the eyes and makes all things dark . 
Nothing happens 
Let it drown , Harry thought , praying for it to get some trouble 
And then , suddenly , the sparks came out of the cauldron . 
Instead , a thick white vapor stream rolled up from the cauldron , obscuring everything in front of Harry , making it no longer visible . 
Wrecks or Cerdic or anything else besides the air suspended in the air There is a glitch , it thinks it drowns God drowned it 
But at that moment , through the fog in front of him , with a frightened cold in him , Harry saw the shadow of a tall , bony man in the cauldron emerging . 
Dress for me ! 
The cold voice came from the fog , and the worm's tail , both sobbing and groaning , still clutched its arms , crawled to pick up some black cloaks on the ground , stood up , lifted up and used one hand . Pull up the robe over his master's head . 
The skinny man stepped out of the cauldron , staring at Harry and Harry also staring at the face that had haunted him for three years of nightmares . 
Whiteer than a skull , with two big eyes , redness and a flat nose like a snake nose with two nostrils 
The Dark Lord Voldemort emerged again . 
CHAPTER 33 THE REAL THEM 
Voldemort does not even look at Harry anymore and begins to examine his body . 
His hands are like pale spiders ; His long white fingers were rubbing his chest , his arms , and his face ; his eyes were bloodshot , his pupils were like a slit , his cat's eyes flaring , brighter in the dark . 
He raised his hand , trying to stretch his fingers , his face gloating extremely happy . 
He did not pay any attention to the scarred worm that was bleeding on the ground ; I do not mind the big snake crawling into Harry's vision and wrapping himself around the beer that Harry was bound to . 
The snake shrieked . 
Voldemort enters a hand with those long fingers in the pocket and pulls out a wand . 
He also stroked the wand gently , then held it up , pointing it to the worm's tail . 
He is lifted off the ground and thrown to the tombstone , where Harry is tied . 
He dropped to the grave and lay there , shrinking and crying . 
Voldemort directed his red eyes to Harry , giving a shrill smile , cold and gloomy . 
The tail of the worm's tail is now covered with blood , because he wrapped his arms in it . 
He choked sobs : 
Your Honor Master promised that He had promised 
Voldemort said , 
Now let's go . 
Oh my master , thank you , my master 
He raised his bleeding arm , but Voldemort laughed : 
That other hand , tail Worm ! 
Your Majesty , please 
Voldemort bent down and pulled out the left arm of the worm's tail ; He scratched the sleeves of the worm's tail coat , and Harry saw something on the skin of the worm's tail , something that looked like a glowing red tattoos - it was a skull . A snake emerges from the mouth . 
This image appeared in the sky in the World Cup Quidditch match . 
that is the sign 
Dark . 
Voldemort examined the sign meticulously , despite the uncontrollable cry of the worm's tail . 
He whispered : 
It's back . 
All of them will notice it and now , we will see now we will know 
He pressed his long white index finger up the sign on the arm of the worm's tail . 
The scar on Harry's forehead ached with a sharp pain , and the worm's tail screamed out in disgust . 
Voldemort withdrew his finger from the sign on Wormtail's arm , and Harry saw it turned black . 
A voracious grin appeared on Voldemort's face , and he straightened up , jerked his head back , glaring around the darkness . 
He whispered , his red eyes staring at the stars : 
How many have the courage to come back after feeling it ? 
And how many would be foolish enough to keep away ? 
He began to walk in front of Harry and Worm's tail , eyes always around the graveyard . 
About a minute later , he looked down at Harry , a brutal smile that distorted his face like a snake's face . 
He hissed . 
Harry Potter , you are standing right on the grave of my late father . 
A Muggle and a fool like your mother . 
But both are the right thing to do ? 
My dad died to protect my son and you killed my father , and see how old he was , when he died . 
Voldemort laughed again . 
He walked around , glancing around as he walked , and the snake curled up on the grass . 
Do you see the house over there on the hillside , Potter ? 
My dad used to live there . 
Auntie , a witch who lives in this village , falls in love with him . 
But he had abandoned her when she told him who she was . He wore no magic . He left my cheeks , returned to my parents before I was born , Potter , and my mother died . But I swore I'd find the old man to take revenge on me , the old man gave me the name of Tom Riddle . 
He walked over , his red eyes peering from one grave to another . 
He quietly continued : 
Listen to me , recall the family story Oh , how come I became so mesmerized But listen , Harry , my real family is back 
The air was suddenly filled with the rustle of the hooded sweatshirts . 
Between the tombs , behind the yew trees , in every corner of the dark , countless magi are filling up . All of them are hooded , wearing masks . 
And one by one , one by one , they come carefully , slowly , as if they still can not believe their eyes . 
Voldemort stood in silence , waiting for them . 
Then a Death Eater knelt down , crawled toward Voldemort , and kissed his black jumper . 
Death Eaters do chatter : 
Owner of employer 
The Death Eater behind him collapsed and followed him , each of them sliding to Voldemort's knees and kissing his robes , then backed up and stood up , forming a quietly ringing circle . Around Voldemort , Harry , and the tomb of Tom Riddle , and the writhing pile of worms called the Wormtail . 
But their circle left an empty space , as if they were waiting for more people . 
However , Voldemort did not seem to expect any more . 
He looked around the sealed faces , and though there was no wind , there was a sound of laughter that seemed to spread around the circle , as if the ring was shaking . 
Voldemort quietly said : 
Bring the Death Eaters , thirteen years have passed . Thirteen years since I last met you . 
And yet you still respond to our message as if it were just yesterday . So we are still united under the sign of Hades ! 
Or not ? 
He raised his horrified face and snorted , his nostrils resembling two large openings . 
He said : 
I smell the sin . 
There was a foul odor in the air . 
A second round of shakes spread around the circle of wizards standing around , as if each member wanted to back away from him without daring . 
I realize that all of you , complete and healthy , with unbroken power - appear so fast - and I wonder why this mage never came to help their master , the owners that have permanently vowed loyalty ? 
No one uttered a word . 
No one moved except for the worm - tailed Screw that was writhing on the ground , still crying over his bleeding arm . 
Voldemort whispered , 
And we answer ourselves , they must believe that we have disappeared , they thought I was dead . 
They rush back to the enemy , pretend to be innocent , argue they are ignorant , they are forced to squeeze and then ask themselves , but how can they believe we can never be raised again ? right ? 
They who know what I have done , long ago , to protect themselves from the death of human beings . 
They who have seen evidence of our terrible power at a time when we are even stronger than all modern mages ! 
And we respond , perhaps they believe that there is even greater power , a power that can dissipate even Lord Voldemort perhaps now that they are putting faithfully elsewhere , perhaps . champion of the fight for the flood , Mudblood and Blood , old Albus Dumbledore ? 
When I heard the name Dumbledore , the members in the circle were all over the place , and some shook their heads . 
Voldemort ignored them . 
That is the disappointment for me . I must confess that I am very disappointed 
One of the guys in the circle suddenly throws himself forward , separated from the circle . 
He trembled from head to toe , and slammed down Voldemort's leg . 
He hissed . 
Owner ! 
My master , forgive me ! 
Forgive us all ! 
Voldemort started laughing . 
Now wand up : 
Crucio ! 
The Deathly Hallows on the ground scream and roll . 
Harry was sure that the screams were so loud that the houses were all around . 
He thought it was a dream : the police came to see whoever went to get anything 
Voldemort raised his wand . 
The Death Eaters tortured lying on the ground , panting . 
Voldemort said softly : 
get up , Avery ! stand up . 
Mi begs forgiveness ? 
I do not forgive . 
Thirteen years long I want the thirteen years to be compensated before I forgive you . 
Worm tail has paid off part of its debt already , right ? Voldemort looked down at the worm - dwarf who was still sobbing . 
You have come back to me , not for loyalty , but for the fear of your old friends . 
Mi deserve the pain , the tail of Trun . 
Mi knew that , right ? 
tail whine wail : 
Yes , my master , please , please 
Voldemort looked at the worm's tails crying on the ground , saying cool : 
Anyway , you have helped me to have the body again . 
A man of weakness and treachery like you , and you helped me And Lord Voldemort rewarded those who helped him 
Voldemort raised his wand again and picked it up in the air . 
A strip of silver - like strands lining up from the wand's head glowed . 
At first it had no shape , then it blurted out and molded itself into a white copy of a human hand , brightly under the moonlight . 
The hand drooped down and attached itself to the bleeding scar of the tusk's tail . 
The croaking of the worm's tail stopped immediately . 
He wheezed , his head snapped and he looked at the silver hand with unbelievable gaze ; The hand was now attached to the elbow , not a lanyard , as if he only wore silver gloves . 
He stretched out his shiny fingers and shook to a small branch on the ground , squeezing it out like a powder . 
He whispered : 
Dear Master , Thank you so much . 
He slid forward with his knees and kissed Voldemort's t - shirt . 
Voldemort said : 
May your loyalty not wobble again , the tail of Trun . 
No , sir , there is no way , my master 
Worm standing up and walked into a place in the circle , watching his powerful new hand , his face still sparkling tears . 
Voldemort was now approaching the man standing on the right side of the worm's tail . 
He stopped in front of this guy and whispered : 
Lucius , my cunning friend . 
I heard you still do not give up the old habits , even for this world , mi always show a respectable face . 
Do you believe that you are still willing to lead the torture of the Muggles ? 
However , you never try to find me , Lucius . Your fun at the World Cup Quidditch match is fun , I dare say so but you can not see that your ability to work . Searching and helping your employer is better ? 
Immediately from under the cover of the masked voice of Lucius Malfoy : 
Sir , I am often in a state of alertness . 
If there was any sign of him , a rumor of where he was , then I immediately came to him , nothing could stop me . 
Voldemort slammed his voice and Lucius Malfoy kept silent : 
My sign is , when a Death Eater launches it to the sky in the summer , is not it ? Yes , I know it all , Lucius and Mi have disappointed me . I look forward to serving you faithfully in the future . 
Of course , sir , of course he was compassionate , thank you . 
Voldemort came , and stopped , staring into the open space - wide enough for two - between Malfoy and the next man . 
Voldemort calmly said : 
Lestranger should have stood there . 
But they were buried in Azkaban . 
They are loyal . 
They would rather be free of Azkaban than break up . When Azkaban is open , I will honor the Lestranger more than they dreamed . 
The Dementors of Azkaban will join our forces which are our natural allies . We will also call on the giants in exile . We will have all the devoted servants coming back to us , and an army of creatures that everyone must fear 
Voldemort continued to walk . He passed some Death Eaters in silence , but stopped in front of another and chatted with them : 
Macnair Heard the worm say now you kill the monsters dangerous to the Ministry of Magic ? 
Sooner or later you will have more delicious victims , Macnair . 
Dark Lord Voldemort will give you 
Macnair answered , 
Thank you , the owner thanking him . 
Voldemort came up with two bulky figures covered with hooded head , masked . 
and here we have Crabbe phen do you do well , Crabbe ? 
And Goyle ? 
Both bowed awkwardly , muttering absurdly : 
Yes , my master , we will 
As Voldemort walked past a ghoulish figure in Goyle's shadow , he calmly said , 
Mi is pretty , Nott . Sir , I am in front of you . 
I am the most loyal to you 
That's good . 
Said Voldemort , then went to the widest space . He gazed at the gap with his red eyes as if he could see the people standing there . 
And here we lack six Death Eaters three deaths for me . 
One too cowardly to not dare to return to him will have to pay . 
One , who is believed to be permanently leaving us , of course he will be killed and one , who is still absolutely loyal to us , is the one who returns to serve us . 
The Deathly Hallows were rumbling , and Harry saw their eyes staring at each other through the mask . 
He was at Hogwarts , that faithful bloke , and it was thanks to his efforts that my young friend was here tonight . 
A smile curls Voldemort's mouth without the eyes of those in the circle pointing towards Harry . 
Voldemort said : 
Right . 
Harry Potter was kind enough to attend our revival party tonight . 
You may consider this as my honor guest . 
Silent . 
Then a Death Eater standing next to the wormhole stepped forward , and Lucius Malfoy's voice rang out from beneath the mask : 
Dear employer , we would like to know how we please tell us how you got this miracle how did you come back to us ? 
Voldemort said : 
Ah , that's an interesting story , Lucius . 
And it started - as well as the end - from our young friend here 
Voldemort stepped aside to stand beside Harry , allowing the eyes of those in the circle to focus on both of them . 
The snake curled around Harry . 
Voldemort said gently : 
Of course you know that people have called this boy our downfall ? 
His red eyes stared at Harry , and the grimace on Harry's forehead was so fierce that Harry almost cried out in pain . 
You all know that the night we lost our power and our body was the night we were about to kill . 
His cheeks died while trying to save his life - and did not expect that death to become a protection that I admit was unforeseeable that I could not touch him . 
Voldemort raised one of his long fingers and pointed it close to Harry's face . 
His mother left in her the blessings of the sacrifice of that she is an old magic . 
We should remember that . 
But I was foolish enough to despise it . 
Now you can touch him . 
Harry felt Voldemort's cold fingers touch him , and he thought his head broke out in pain . 
Voldemort smiles at his ear , then pulls his fingers back and continues to speak to the Death Eaters . 
I made a mistake , my friends , I recognized it . 
My curse is misplaced by the stupid sacrifice of that woman , and it bounces back on me . 
Worse than the pain , my dear friends , all of a sudden . I was stripped of my own body , I was less than a soul , lost the most evil one But I do not die . 
What I am , I do not know myself , who went further than anyone on the path of seeking immortality . You know my purpose - to conquer Death . 
And now that I've been tested , it seems that some of my experiments have succeeded because I did not die , even though the curse would have killed me . 
However , we pretend to be the weakest creature in the world , and there is no way to take care of ourselves without the body , and all the spells that can save us need the use of the tree . Magic wand 
I just remember I forced myself to exist , in every second , without ceasing , not sleeping . I hid in a remote place , in the forest , and waited to be one of the loyal Death Eaters . We must try to find one of them must come and perform for us the magic that we can not do , to restore a body but we have been waiting in vain . 
Again the shaking spread in the circle of the Death Eaters standing listening . 
Voldemort let the silence grow to horror and then continue : 
There is only one power left . 
I can enter into the body of another . 
But I do not dare to go to crowded places , because I know that the gods are still everywhere and are looking for me . Sometimes we have to live in animals - of course , snakes are the animals we like best - but we only live in animals as a soul , because their bodies are not suitable for transport . The magic and the use of their bodies make them prematurely dead ; No animal ever lived long enough 
Then four years ago the means of resurrection seemed certain . 
A magician - young , stupid and confident - wanders the road in the forest that we are hiding . 
Well , he seems to be the opportunity that I dream of because he is a Dumbledore school teacher . He easily obeyed me as he brought me back to this country , and some time later , we have appropriated his body , sent him full when he performed my orders . 
But my plan failed . 
I did not manage to steal the Witch Stone . 
I did not hold on to an immortal life . 
I was broken again broken , by the name of Harry Potter 
Again , it was all silent . 
There is nothing moving , including the leaves of the yew tree . 
Death Eaters are completely motionless . 
Eyes glittering on the sealed faces were staring at Harry Potter and Voldemort . 
Voldemort continued : 
The servant died when we left his body , and we were as weak as before . 
I returned to my sanctuary in a very far away place , and I did not hide from you that at that time I was afraid that it would never be possible to restore my power properly , perhaps it was the moment . The darkest of my life I can not hope to find another magician to occupy his body and I have given up hope that there is one of the Death Eaters who bothered happened to me 
One or two masked mages stood in a vicious circle , but Voldemort did not care . 
And then , a year ago , when I almost gave up hope , that would eventually happen . A subordinate came back to me . 
The name of this worm , who faked his death to escape justice , was expelled from the shelter by people he once considered a friend , so he decided to return to his master . . 
He has been looking for me in the country where rumors have long been the place where we flee . Of course he was pointed , thanks to the mice on the road . The worm's tail has a suspiciously close relationship with the rats , is not it , the worm's tail ? 
His little dudes showed him a deep spot in the woods of Albania , where they had to be kept away , by a shadow that made small animals like them like Death . 
But his journey back to me is not smooth , right , Worm's tail ? 
Because , when he came to the forest he was looking for me , one night , he was hungry and stupidly stopped at a forest inn looking for food and he met someone there , Bertha Jorkins , a sorcerer of the Ministry of Magic . 
Think about how fate was to the Dark Lord Voldemort . 
That confrontation could end the life of the tailed macaque , and also ends up hope for our last recovery . 
But the worm's tail was brilliant , which I did not care for him : he invited Bertha Jorkins with him for a night out . 
Make him crazy and bring him to my place . And Bertha Jorkins , who could have ruined everything , turns out to be a gift we can not even dream of - for example . coaxing a bit - is the spout that spits out the actual repository . 
She tells us about the Magic Trilogy that will take place at Hogwarts this year . 
She tells us she knows a loyal Death Eater who can help us , as long as we can contact him . 
She told us a lot of things , but the way we tweaked her memory was so powerful that when we extracted all the useful information from her , then her mind and body were all too damaged . can fix . 
That's all . 
I can not take it . 
I ' ll just kill you . 
Voldemort had a horrible grin , his red eyes staggerless . 
Of course , the body of the worm's tail is not very comfortable , because everyone considers him dead , if anyone recognizes him will cause attention is not beneficial . 
Even so , he is still a body servant when he needs it , and although he is a bad magician , the worm's tail can follow his orders , so that he can recover the body . our own neonatal fetus , a body that we have 
Staying temporarily while waiting for the necessary materials for our rebirth . Some of the mantras we invented a little help the passion of Nagini . 
Voldemort's red eyes peered down at the snake , crawling around , spitting around . 
Some of the medicine produced from the serpentine blood and snake venom provided by Nagini was soon returned to being almost human , and strong enough to travel . 
I hope to steal the Sorcerer's Stone , because I know Dumbledore oversaw the destruction of the stone . 
But we still embrace a normal life , before pursuing immortality . 
We lower our goals lower We will stabilize our old body first , and regain our former strength . 
I know how to achieve this - the medicine that revived me this night is just a bit of Dark Arts - we need three strong materials . 
Oh , one of those three things already in hand , have not you tailed Worm ? 
The meat of a servant dedicates 
My father's bones , of course , that's why I have to come here , where I am buried . 
And the blood of a worm - nosed ranger helped me to use my wand , did not it , Worm's tail ? 
The blood of any mage who hates me , but he who hates me . 
But if we want to rise again , we must use one's blood , to gain more strength than before we have fallen . 
I want the blood of Harry Potter . 
I want the blood of one who has exhausted my strength and power thirteen years ago . Because of the blessings of his cheeks that he has left in his body he will now flow in my veins . 
But how to get Harry Potter ? 
Because it is always better protected than its knowledge , as we think , it has long been protected by Dumbledore in many ways , when he assumes the responsibility of placing his future . 
He had resorted to an ancient trick , so long as the child was cared for by his relatives , it was safeguarded . 
Even I can not do at my grandparents . Of course , the World Cup Quidditch match is an opportunity . I think its protection will be weakened there when it is away from home and not old . Dumbledore kept his eyes on me , but I was not strong enough to be able to kidnap him in the midst of a crowd of wizards of the Ministry of Magic . 
So he went back to Hogwarts , where he lived from morning to night under the care of the old Muggle - dulled old man . 
How can I get it ? 
Of course , by taking advantage of Bertha Jorkins . 
Using a loyal Death Eater in Hogwarts , I guarantee that the boy's name is put in the Goblet . 
I use my Death Eater to ensure that the kid wins the competition - thinking it will be the first to touch the Cup - the Cup that our Death Eaters have transformed into a Port Key . , to bring it here , away from Dumbledore's protection and help , to fall into my waiting arm . 
And here is the little kid that you all thought was the one who knocked me down 
Voldemort walks slowly forward , looking back at Harry's face . 
He raised his wand : 
Crucio ! 
This pain far exceeds every pain Harry experienced ; Its bones seem to be baked on fire ; Its head must have cracked along the scars ; Its eyes are rounded like crazy in the skull ; It just wants to end the fainted desire to die 
And then the pain passed . 
Harry hung up in the ring and tied it to Voldemort's gravestone . 
He looked up into red eyes as if through a fog . the night of the echoes of the Death Eaters . 
Voldemort said : 
You see , I think there is nothing more foolish than to think that this kid can be stronger than me . 
But I want that there will be no more confusion in the mind of anyone . 
Harry Potter got rid of our hands due to a chance luck . 
And now I will prove my strength by killing it . Oh and here . 
In front of everyone , there is no Dumbledore help and no mother to die for it . 
I will give it a chance . 
He will be allowed to fight , and you will not doubt anything between me and him who is stronger . 
Wait a minute . 
Nagini ! 
Voldemort whispered , snaking away from Harry , through the grass , to the Death Eaters watching . 
Worm tail , untied it , and returned it wand . 
CHAPTER 34 CURRENT ISSUES BEFORE NOW 
Worm's tail approached Harry . 
When the rope was taken off , Harry hurried to stand up to support his body . The worm pulled out his new silver hand , pulled the knot of the string that was bound to Harry , and then with a sharp blow , cut the rope in Harry's head with the tombstone . 
Perhaps for a split second , Harry had thought of running away , but his injured leg trembled as he struggled to stand up on the tombstone . 
And the Death Eaters stand together , squeezing the circle around him and Voldemort , to seal the gaps of the Death Eaters in absentia . The worm went out of the circle , reached Cerdic's corpse and returned with Harry's wand , rudely pressing Harry hard without even looking at it . 
Then , the worm's tail returned to his position in the circle of the Death Eaters watching . 
Voldemort said , 
Have you been taught how to fight duel then Harry Potter ? 
Voldemort's eyes gleamed in the darkness . 
Like the story from a previous life , Harry heard a couple of hours at the Hogwarts School that he attended a short time ago two years ago . It's the Expelliarmus Magical Expedition , but if it could take Voldemort's wand off , what good is it to have around a Death Eater , at least thirty a It has never learned anything that can be used in such a case . 
He knew that he was confronted with what Moody always warned about the irreconcilable curse Avada Kedavra - and Voldemort was right - he did not get it here but sacrificed it completely uncovered . carry on again 
Voldemort said : 
We greet each other , Harry Potter ! 
He leaned slightly , but still raised his snake face toward Harry : 
Greetings , respect for delicate delicate things Dumbledore would have wanted you to be as elegant as a mercenary Death , Harry ! 
The Death Eaters laughed . 
Voldemort's open mouth also bent over a so - called smile . 
Harry did not bow . 
He would not let Voldemort play cat - and - mouse with him before killing him where it would not give him no pleasure . 
Voldemort raised his wand , saying : 
I say bow ! 
Harry felt his spine curl down as if a huge , invisible hand was pressing down on him cruelly , and the Deathly Hallows laughed more than ever . 
Good . 
Voldemort said softly as he raised his wand , and the pressure on Harry's head was lifted . 
And now you face me like a straight and proud man , like the way your father died And now we're dueling . 
Voldemort now wields the wand , and before Harry can do anything to defend himself , even before Harry can budge , he bears the curse of Torture . 
The pain was so terrible , so overwhelming that it no longer knew where it was . The whitewashed blades fell into every feces of its flesh , its head was almost crushed by pain , it screamed . shouting louder than any scream she had ever uttered in her life 
And then Harry stopped . 
Rolled up and up ; It was trembling in the same way that Worm's tail shook when he cut his arm . 
Harry stepped aside as he touched the Death Eater's wall . 
They pushed it out , slamming it into Voldemort's hand . 
Voldemort's nose was opened by pleasure . 
He said : 
take a break . 
A little pain , Harry ? 
Do you want me to do that again ? 
Want to ? 
Harry did not reply . 
He is about to die like Cerdic , the violent red eyes are telling him it's about to die , and there's nothing he can do but it will not do Voldemort's distraction . His orders would not beg him 
Voldemort said gently : 
Tao asked you if you wanted me to do that again ? Answer me ! 
Imperio ! 
Harry felt , for the third time in his life , the feeling of his mind cleared up all the thoughts . Not just say not just say no 
A powerful voice from deep in Harry's head said , " I will not be answering 
Please answer no 
I will not do that , I will not say 
Only answer no 
I DO NOT SAY ! 
As these voices leapt out of Harry's mouth , they echoed across the graveyard , and the drowsy state disappeared abruptly as though it had just thrown a bucket of cold water on his head - the painful feeling that cursed Tra Xun The cause is spreading throughout its body - it returns to reality , recognizes where it is and is confronted with something . 
Voldemort said coldly : 
Do not you say ? 
The Death Eaters are now laughing . 
Voldemort said : 
Do not you say ' no ' ? 
Harry , is the virtue that I need to teach you before you die , maybe a painful dose ? 
Voldemort raised his wand , but this time Harry was ready ; Thanks to the reflexes practiced well for the Quidditch matches , Harry set himself aside and rolled on the ground ; He rolls over Voldemort's marble tombstone , and he hears a cracked beer as he catches a curse . 
Voldemort's cold , small voice came close to him , while the Death Eaters shouted , 
We do not play hide and seek , Harry ? 
How can you escape me ? 
Are you tired of dueling ? 
Is this you want me to finish early , Harry ? 
Come out , Harry out here and play fast will be less painful than how we know we never die 
Harry hid behind the tombstone and knew that the end came . 
There is no hope anymore and no longer expect any help . 
When he hears Voldemort come close , he knows only one thing , and it goes far beyond fear : he will not die of crouching here as a kid playing hide and seek ; It will not die of prostration at Voldemort's feet . It will die like her father , and it will die in self - defense , even if she has no defenses at all . 
Harry stood up , before Voldemort could see his snake - like face behind the tombstone . Harry clutched his wand in his hand , swinging his chopsticks straight ahead , dashing out of the beer , facing Voldemort . 
Voldemort is ready . 
When Harry screams Expelliarmus ! Voldemort chants Avada Kedavra ! 
A blast of light from Voldemort's wand emitted at the same time a red light from Harry's wandhead came - two lights flashing in mid - air - and suddenly Harry's wand shook violently . As if there was a strong electric current flowing through it , Harry's hand clutched his wand , unable to let go of his hand even if it wanted to . 
And a beam of light connects the two wands , not reddish blue , but gold glows . 
Harry looked at the beam of light , incredibly amazed by the long white finger strokes grasp Voldemort's wrench trembling . 
And then - Harry could not imagine this - he felt his foot lifted off the ground . 
Both it and Voldemort were pulled up into the air , their wands still joined together by a brilliant beam of gold . 
Both glided from Voldemort's father's grave and stopped at an empty , grave site . The Deathly Hallows screamed ; They are asking Voldemort what they should do ; They clump together , tightening the circle around Harry and Voldemort , the snake crawling under their feet , some Death Eaters drew their wands 
A beam of yellow light connecting the two wands suddenly burst ; although the two wands were still interconnected by thousands of beams of light radiating rainbow over Harry and Voldemort , woven around all around them , until the beams of light came to an end . dome - shaped net , like a light cage ; and outside this light cage , the Deathly Hallows gathered in circles like a pack of jackals , their cries now sound like muffled 
Voldemort shrieks with the Death Eaters : 
Do not do anything ! 
Harry saw Voldemort's red eyes widened in amazement at what was going on . 
Harry saw him trying to break the beam of light that still connected his wand to Harry's wand . 
Harry held his wand tighter with both hands , and the beam of gold was still unbroken . 
Voldemort yells at Death Eaters : 
Do not do anything unless I tell you . 
And then a sound of supreme emptiness filled with the sound of space emerged from each ray of light forming a dome - shaped network vibrating gently around Harry and Voldemort . 
It was a sound that Harry recognized , though it had only been heard before in his life : it was a phoenix song . 
It was the sound of hope for Harry that was the most beautiful , most anticipated thing that Harry had ever heard in his life . It felt as if the song was ringing in it , not around it . is the sound that connects it to Dumbledore , and that sound is almost the voice of his friends encouraging it . 
Do not let this connection break 
Harry told that song , I know . 
I know I was not allowed to but it was not finished , the situation has become more difficult . 
Its wand began to shake ever more violently , and now the beam of light between Harry and Voldemort had changed as if the shining beads were sliding up and down on the thread of light connecting the two . The wand moves from Voldemort toward Harry , and Harry feels his wand shaking with anger . 
As the nearest lightning bolts moved closer to Harry's wand , the wand's grip on Harry's fingers became so hot that Harry Potter feared it would burn . 
The nearest continent rolled , Harry's trembling trembled ; It is certain that his wand will not be intact when exposed to the bean ; He felt as if his wand was about to crumble in his fingers 
It manipulates the final molecules of the brain to concentrate its will on repulsing the beads towards Voldemort , in whose ears the phoenix's music resonates , its eyes full of wrath , glare and then Slowly , very slowly , some beads vibrate and stop completely ; And then , very slowly , they began to move in the opposite direction . Now , the wand in Voldemort's hand shook violently . Voldemort was extremely surprised , almost panicked . 
One of the beads vibrates , just a few inches from Voldemort's wand . 
Harry does not know why he does so , nor does he know what to do , but now he concentrates very much , concentrating it unmatched in his life , That turned to Voldemort's chopsticks , and slowly , slowly , the beads moved over the golden light thread , shaking for a moment and then hooking on Voldemort's wand . 
Instantly , Voldemort's wand began to echo the painful echoes that followed - Voldemort's vivid red eyes fluttered with shock - a fiery hand made its way out of the wand's head and That's the ghost of the hand that Voldemort has done to the worm's tail . More and more screams of pain . And then something bigger started to pop out of Voldemort's chopsticks , something huge gray , as if it were made of the most condensed smoke that was a head , then to the chest and hand and body of Cerdic Diggory . 
It was a moment when Harry was so stunned that he could grieve his hands from the wand , but instinctively kept his wand so tightly that the golden light had not broken , Cerdic's full - figured , gray figure appeared fully from Voldemort's wand , as if it were leaking from a narrow tunnel - was it Cerdic's innocence ? 
It looks so solid - The Cerdic figure stood up , looked up at the golden light , and said , 
Hold it tight , Harry ! 
Cerdic's voice sounds distant and echoes . 
Harry looked straight at Voldemort and his fiery red eyes were still stunned . He could not even imagine this , as Harry was and so dim , Harry sounded like the screaming horror of the Death Eaters . gasoline around the dome of golden light 
The more painful screams emanating from Voldemort's wand and then something escaped from the tip of the wand , the dense shadow of a second head , and then his hands and feet quickly revealing an old man Harry had once seen in his dream , the old man slipping out Voldemort's wand exactly like Cerdic . 
Then his soul , or his ghost , or something , fell on Cerdic's side , leaned against his staff , then looked at Harry , Voldemort , looking at the golden dome and the two trees . The wands are connected with a look of wonder 
The old man looked at Voldemort and said , 
So he was a magician ? 
The man who killed me , he hit him , little child 
But then another head protruded and this head , as gray as a statue , was the head of a woman . Both of Harry's hands were now trembling as he tried to hold onto the wand . . 
He saw the woman who had fallen to the ground and stood up like the others , gazing at him 
Bertha Jorkins's shadow stood in front of the battlefield with wide open eyes . 
She exclaimed , her voice as distant as echoing Cerdic's voice : 
do not let go Do not let him catch you , Harry ! do not let go 
Mrs. Bertha and two other ghosts began circling the inside of the dome with golden light , while the Death Eaters jammed outside the arch . And the victims were killed by Voldemort murmured . With the tightening of the ring around the two players , they whispered cheers to Harry , and hissed something with Voldemort that Harry could not hear . 
Now , another head appeared from Voldemort's wand and Harry knew who that person was , as if expecting him from the moment Cerdic appeared from the wand he knew , Because the man appeared to be the one he thought more than the whole night 
The haze of a tall man with a messy hair standing on the ground like Bertha stood , straightening up , and Harry and Harry looking back at the ghost's face , his hands trembling . up like crazy 
He said softly : 
Your mother is coming to me Mama wants to meet you Hold on to you and it will be okay 
And Harry's cheeks appear , first to the head , then to the torso . The hazy shadow of the long - haired young woman is Harry Potter's Lily Potter . 
She escaped from Voldemort's wand , fell to the ground , and straightened up as if against herself . 
She walked up to Harry , very close , bent over to look at it , and she spoke to her in distant voice as if coming from somewhere , like the voice of other evil spirits , but she spoke to him , leaving Voldemort unable to hear . 
Voldemort's face is now purple with fear as the injustice of his victims hover around him . 
Harry's mother told her son : 
When the connection is broken , the cheeks and other people can only linger in a frail moment but the cheeks and other people will take the time for the child to run to the lock key , it will Take me back to Hogwarts do you understand , Harry ? 
Harry gasped breathlessly : 
Yes . 
He had to fight fiercely to keep the wand out of his fingers . 
Cerdic's ball whispered to Harry : 
Harry brought his body home ? bring your body back to his parents 
Harry said : 
I promise . 
Harry's face wrinkled as he tried to hold the wand . 
His father's voice sounded : 
Now do it , be ready to run , baby Do it 
Harry yelled : 
Beef ! 
Anyhow , it does not believe that it can hold the wand anymore . 
She picked up her wand with a jarring effort , and the yellow light stranded , the bright yellow dome disappeared , the phoenix's song died , but the shadow of the smoke of the victims . Voldemort's still not gone . They're surrounded by Voldemort , shielding Harry from his vision 
And Harry ran as if he had never run like that in his life , falling to Death Eaters when he ran past them . 
He runs the chain behind the tombstones , he feels the curse is chasing after his back , hears them hit the gravestones Harry spat between the curse and the stela , rushed to the test Cerdic , no longer aware of the pain of his injured leg . 
All human beings now focus only on what they have to do 
He heard Voldemort shout : 
Point of acupuncture it ! 
Taking Cerdic's body three feet away , Harry rushed behind a marble statue of angel to dodge the red light and saw an angelic splinter smashed when struck by the spell . 
Clutching his wand further , Harry leapt out of the statue 
Impedimenta ! 
He screamed , pointing his great wand over the shoulders of Death Eaters chasing after him . 
Based on the choking noise , Harry believed it had blocked at least one Death Eater , but it had no time to stop or look ; She jumps to the cup and lunges to avoid the spells , just as there are many winds whistling from the wands behind her back . 
Harry fell down , lightning flashed over his head ; He still reached out to grab Cerdic's arm 
Voldemort's voice shrieked loudly : 
Get out of the party ! 
I will kill it ! 
It's mine ! 
Harry's hand reached Cerdic's wrist ; Between them and Voldemort is now only a tombstone , but Cerdic is too heavy for Harry to carry , while the cup is out of Harry's reach . 
Voldemort's red eyes burned in the darkness . 
Harry saw his mouth curl up into a smile . Harry saw his raised wand 
Harry screamed : 
Accio ! 
Its wand pointed at the Magic Triangle . 
Cai paced up into the air , rushed over to Harry , taking a snapshot of the cup handle 
Harry heard Voldemort growling in anger as he felt a strong jerk in his nostrils , meaning that the lock was in motion . The lock was giving Harry flight in a whirlwind of wind and color . 
And Cerdic flies with it . The two are flying back to school . 
Chapter 35 PHARMACY 
Harry felt flushed to the ground , his beak in the grass , the smell of grass in his nose . 
He closed his eyes when the Harbor Key carried it in the air , and now his eyes were still closed . 
It does not budge . 
It seemed as if all the breath had been thrown out of his lungs . Its head was so badly dented that it felt like the ground at the foot swung like a ship's deck . In order to keep his body stable , Harry grasped the two things he still held in his arms : the cold grip of the Magic Triangle and Cerdic Diggory's body . 
Harry felt as if it would fall into the dark realms gathering around his mind if he let go of one of his hands . 
The excitement and the exhaustion made him paralyzed on the ground , sniffed the grass , and waited for someone to do something waiting for something to happen and during that time , the scars of it hurts forever on the forehead 
Then a torrent of rain fell around him , causing Harry to tinnitus and bewildered ; Every time I hear voices , footsteps , screams It is still in place , wrinkled by the sounds around it , as if it was a nightmare that it just wanted to wake up and leave for then . 
Suddenly there was a hand on Harry , flipping it over : 
Harry ! 
Harry ! 
He opened his eyes . 
He was staring at the starry sky , and Dumbledore was bowing over it . 
The dark shadows of the crowd are gathering around , pressing on , closer and closer ; Harry felt the ground below was shaking because of the crowd's footsteps . 
It was back on the edge of the maze . 
Now it can see the high platforms rising up , the shadows of some people moving on it , and the higher stars . 
Harry let go of the cup , but he still clung to Cerdic , even tighter . 
The hand that had let go of his trophy now held up Dumbledore's wrist , Dumbledore's picture of him swirling in ambiguity . 
Harry whispered : 
He's back ! 
Teacher , he's back , Voldemort back . 
What's going on ? What happened ? 
Cornelius Fudge's face appeared above Harry , looking bleak and terrified . 
He exclaimed softly : 
Oh my God ! Diggory ! 
Dumbledore Oh , he's dead ! 
The words were repeated , the shape of the luggage pressed forward , gasped , gasped to the people around and then the other screamed up in the night : 
He's dead ! 
He is dead ! 
Cedric Diggory ! 
Dead ! 
Harry heard Fudge's voice : 
Harry , let go , baby . 
He felt his fingers ripped out of Cerdic's stiff body , but he still did not let go of his hand . 
Then Dumbledore's face , still faintly vague , bent closer to him . 
Harry , I can not help it . 
It's over . 
Let go . 
Harry muttered - seemingly explaining this is very important : 
I want to bring pictures of pictures I want to bring pictures with three cheeks 
All right , Harry . Now let go of my hand 
Dumbledore bent down , and with extraordinary strength , compared to such an old and sickly man , he lifted Harry up from the ground and set him up . 
Harry shook his head , his head hanging up . 
His injured leg was not strong enough to support his body weight . The crowd around them pushed each other , scrambling for a place closer to it , mingling it mysteriously . 
What happened ? 
What's wrong ? 
Is Diggory dead ? 
Mr. Fudge said loudly : 
This game needs to be taken to the sick ! 
It's sick ! 
It was injured ! ... 
Dumbledore , Diggory's cheeks are here , in the stands 
Dumbledore , let me take care of Harry , I ' ll take care of it 
No , let me 
Dumbledore , Mr. Amos Diggory is running to him . He thinks he should tell him before he sees . 
Harry , stay here 
The girls were screaming screaming mournfully in a strange lightning flashed in Harry's eyes . 
That's fine , son . 
I will take you back to sickness 
Dumbledore told me to stay here 
Harry said harshly , the scar on his forehead hurt so violently that it felt like vomiting . 
Its eyes blossomed , everything shimmered more than ever . 
You need to lie down right away 
Someone taller than he was half dragged half help carry it through the panic crowd . 
Harry listened to him , his breath panting , the cry , and the screams as the man helped him parrot through the crowd , bringing it back to the castle . 
Crossing the lawn , through the lake still in Durmstrang's ship , Harry heard no more sound except for the heavy breathing of the man who was walking his steps . 
Finally , as he lifted it onto the stone steps , the man asked , 
What happened , Harry ? 
Pack , Box , Box . that's Moody Mister - crazy : 
When the two teachers walked through the hall , Harry said , 
The Cup is a Lock . 
She brought him and Cerdic to a graveyard and Voldemort where Dark Lord Voldemort 
Pack , Box , Box . Two people go up the marble stairs 
The Dark Lord Voldemort is there ? So what happens again ? 
Kill Cerdic They kill Cerdic 
And then ? 
Pack , Box , Box . Two people walking along the corridor 
Make a medicine to restore his body 
Will Dark Lord Voldemort recover his body ? 
Have you resurrected ? 
And the Death Eaters come and play duels 
The duel with the Dark Lord ? 
Escape .. the wand of the children are so enlightened I see their mother's three children escaped from his wand 
Here , Harry Here , sit down I ' ll be healed soon Drink this 
Harry heard the sound of the lock and had a feeling that a cup was in his hands . 
Drink the baby . You will feel better , now Harry , you need to know exactly what has happened 
Brother Moody helped Harry swallow some water down his throat ; it choked , a spicy pepper burned its throat . 
Moody's office is also clear . He looks as white as Mr. Fudge's face , with both his eyes fixed on Harry's face . 
Has Voldemort revived , Harry ? 
I'm sure Voldemort was back ? 
How did he do it ? 
Harry said : 
He took a pill from the grave of his father , taken from the worm's tail , and from his . 
Harry's mind was now clearer , and the scar on his forehead was no longer painful . 
Harry could see clearly Moody's face , even though the office was a bit dark . 
He could also hear the screams echoing from far away Quidditch . 
Mr. Moody says : 
What does the Black Lord do for you ? 
Harry raised his arm and said , 
Blood . 
Her shirt was torn at the tail of Worm torn dagger . 
Mr. Moody let out a long sigh in a slight hiss . 
And Death Eaters ? 
Are they back too ? 
Harry replied , 
Yes , heaps 
Brother Moody asked in a low voice : 
How did you treat them ? 
Do you forgive them ? 
But Harry suddenly remembered . 
He should have told Dumbledore , he should have told you that 
There is a Death Eater in Hogwarts ! 
There is a Death Eater here He leaves his name in the Goblet of Fire , he has assured me to go to his destination 
Harry stood up , but Moody pushed him down . 
He said coldly : 
I know who Death Eater is . 
Scared Harry : 
Is not Mr. Karkaroff teacher ? 
Where are you ? 
Did you catch him ? 
Are you locked up ? 
With a great laugh , Moody says : 
Karkaroff ? 
Mr. Karkaroff had been away since early the morning when he felt the Dark Sign burning on his arm . 
He betrayed so many loyal servants of the Dark Lord that he no longer dared see them again . But he was not going anywhere . 
The Dark Lord has many methods to detect enemy traces . 
Mr. Karkaroff gone ? 
Are you running away ? 
But then did not he himself put his name on the Fire ? 
Moody said slowly : 
Are not . 
Not old . 
I was the one who did it . 
Harry heard , but could not believe it . 
It says : 
No , you do not do that you do not do that You can not do it 
I assure you that we do it . 
Moody's magical eyes fluttered around and glared toward the door , and Harry knew he was checking to see if anyone was outside . 
At the same time , Moody withdrew the wand , pointed at Harry and said , 
So you forgive them ? 
Death of the Death Eaters do not suffer ? 
Those who have escaped the Azkaban jail ? 
Harry looked puzzled : 
What's up ? 
He was looking at Moody's wand pointing at it . It must have been a joke , probably a joke . 
Moody said coldly : 
I ask you , will you forgive the scum who did not seek him ? 
The cowardly rebels , not even because of you , but the Azkaban hell . 
The filthy , filthy , disheveled , brave enough to jump up to cheering under the mask at the World Cup Quidditch match , but turned over when he saw the Dark Sign . I launched into the sky that night 
You fired ? What are you talking about ? 
I told you , Harry I said to ki . 
If there is one thing that we hate the most , they are the Death Eaters . 
They abandoned my master when he needed them most . 
I wanted to torture them . 
Please tell Harry , tell me you have hurt them 
Moody's face flashed a mad smile : 
Tell me that you have told them that , alone , I am faithful to you , willing to risk everything to give you what you want more than all of you . You can not do NOT be a teacher 
Who gave you the name of Fire , under the name of another school ? 
I am here . 
Who has threatened to banish everything that I think could hurt you and prevent me from winning the competition ? 
I am here . 
Who had urged Hagrid to lead you to see the dragons ? 
I am here . 
Who helps you see the only way you can win the dragon ? 
I am here . 
Moody's eyeballs now stop guarding the door . 
That eye was staring at Harry . 
The distorted Moody's mouth is more distracted than ever . 
It's not easy , Harry , leading you through all these tests without raising suspicion is not easy . 
I have to apply to each glass of the cunning brain that I have , so that my hands are not exposed is embedded in your success . 
Dumbledore would have doubted if you could solve things so easily . 
Wait until you enter the labyrinth , relatively well from the beginning in a manner consistent with that time , I know , I will have the opportunity to eliminate other players to pave the way for you . 
But we must also be tired of your ignorance . 
The second test is when we are afraid that we will fail . 
I keep my eyes open , Potter . 
I know you did not find the clue in the egg , so I have to suggest to help you 
Harry said hoarsely : 
Not a teacher . 
Cerdic is the new hint 
And who told Cerdic to open the egg under water ? 
I am here . 
I believe it will transfer that information to you . 
It's easy to be honest , Potter . 
I'm sure Cerdic would like to reply to you for revealing to him the dragon thing and it did exactly that . 
But even then , Potter , even then you seem to have lost . 
I keep watch for hours in the library . 
Do not you realize that the book I need is always available in my bedroom ? 
I have set it up before , I give it to Neville , do you remember ? 
Plants of mystical Mystic Aquifer and their characteristics . 
I wanted to tell you , or what all you need to know , about grass and fish . 
I want to ask everyone and anyone who can help . 
Neville can tell you right away . 
But do not ask me Mi do not ask Mi pride and independence can ruin all my plans . 
Then what should we do ? The information in the head of the other way more carefree . 
On Christmas Eve , you told me about an elf named Dobby who gave you a Christmas present . 
I called the elf to the teacher's room to get some laundry robes . 
I presented a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the selected hostages , and said that Harry had no idea how to use grass to fish . 
So your eldest brother ran a circuit to Professor Snape's medicine cabinet and hurried to find you . 
Moody's wand is still pointing right at Harry's heart . 
The mirror on the wall behind Moody's shoulders appears as dim as moving smoke . 
You have been on the bottom of the lake too long , Potter . 
I thought you were drowning . 
Fortunately , Dumbledore saw your stupidity as nobility and gave you a high point of that . 
I breathe again . 
Of course , tonight was a much more pleasant time than what I could have experienced without my help . 
We watch around the maze , so that we can see through the surrounding garlands , so that we can use the spell to break through the obstacles on the road . 
I lost Fleur Delacour when she passed the challenge . 
I also cast my domineering curse on Krum so that it would follow him to assassinate Cerdic , leaving the clear path for me to go to the cup . 
Harry looked up at Moody . 
It still can not understand how this story is the truth . Dumbledore's friend , the famous Goddess who has captured countless Death Eaters , has no meaning at all . over 
The smog - shaped reflections in the Hollow mirror are sharpening , and then becoming clear . 
Harry could see the shape of the three over Moody's shoulder , getting closer and closer . 
But Moody did not see them . 
His magical eyes stared at Harry's eyes . 
Moody whispered : 
The Dark Lord did not turn around to kill you , Potter , how much he wanted to do . 
Imagine how you would reward me when you knew what I had done for you . 
I give you - mi , what you need more than all to reborn - and then I will kill you for him . 
I will be honored over all other Death Eaters . 
I will become your most loving , trusted and beloved person more than a son 
Moody's eyes are protruding , while the magician's eyes still stare at Harry . 
The door was blocked , and Harry knew it was impossible to retrieve his wand in time 
Moody now seems completely crazy , he leaned over Harry's head , glanced at Harry with all his might : 
The Dark Lord and we all have many similarities . 
For example , we both have fathers who do nothing real , nothing . 
Both of us bear the shame of bearing the name of our father . 
And we both have the great pleasure of killing our father to ensure the continuous rise of the Dark Order ! 
Harry could not control himself , he shouted : 
You're crazy ! 
You're crazy ! 
Moody's voice goes up like it can not be compressed : 
crazy 
Are you crazy ? to consider ! To see who is crazy when the Dark Lord comes back to me ! 
You came back , Harry Potter , you did not win him and now I win you ! 
Moody raised his wand , he opened his mouth ; Harry put his hands in his pocket 
Stupefy ! 
A bright red light blinding , with a bang and a loud bang , the door of Professor Moody's office burst open . 
Moody was thrown back to the office floor . 
Harry was still staring at Moody's face , but now it was Dumbledore's face , Snape and Professor McGonagall looking back at him from the mirror . 
He looked back and saw the three of them standing in the doorway , Dumbledore standing in front of the other two , holding his wand straightened . 
Harry understood for the first time why people would say that Dumbledore was the only one that Voldemort was afraid of . 
Dumbledore's face when he looked at the immobile form of Moody Eyes - crazy more terrible than anything Harry could imagine . 
There was no smiles on Dumbledore's face , no flashing glint in the bright eyes behind the glasses . 
Just a cold anger in each of the wrinkles of the ancient face , the feeling of the power radiates from Dumbledore as if the instrument is releasing the flow of heat . 
He stepped into the office , set foot on the immobile body of Moody , kicked him to roll back , leaving his face clear . 
Snape came in behind Dumbledore , looking at the Mirror , in which his face was still staring into the room . 
Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry . 
Her thin lips rippled as if she was about to cry . 
She whispered : 
Let's go , Potter . 
Let's go to sickness 
Dumbledore said right away : 
Hold on . 
Dumbledore , he had to take a look at it and take it enough for tonight 
Dumbledore said in a tone of voice : 
Harry must stay here , Minerva , because he needs to understand . 
Understanding is the first step to getting accepted . 
And only the acceptance of the recovery . 
It needs to know who put it on the path of suffering that it has gone through tonight , and why . 
Harry said in a state of total disbelief : 
That person is Moody . 
And how could it be Moody ? 
Dumbledore calmly said : 
This is not Alastor Moody . 
I never met Alastor Moody . 
Moody really can not take me out of sight after what happened tonight . 
So the moment he led me away , he knew immediately and he followed . 
Dumbledore bent down to Moody's stark shape and put a hand into his pockets . 
He pulled out the medicine and a bunch of keys . 
He returned to Snape and Professor McGonagall : 
Severus , please give me the strongest pillow you have , then go down to the kitchen and bring up an elf named Winky . 
Mrs. Minerva , please go down to Mr. Hagrid's house , where you will see a huge black dog sitting in a pumpkin garden . 
Bring the dog to my office , tell her I ' ll meet her in a little while , then she ' ll come back here . 
If Professor Snape or Professor McGonagall feels these orders are ridiculous , they also hide the embarrassment . 
The two immediately turned around and left the office . 
Dumbledore went to the chest with seven locks , took the first lock on the first one , and opened it . 
Inside the chest contains a pile of spell books . 
Dumbledore closed the chest , took the second key into the second lock , and opened the chest again . books of lost charms ; This time the chest contained a miscellany of broken Broken Glasses , a piece of parchment and a goose feather , and something that looked like a silver Invisibility Cloak . 
Harry looked , dumbfounded , when Dumbledore took the third , fourth , fifth , sixth keys of his respective keys , each time opening the chest to see the different contents inside the chest . . 
Finally when Dumbledore inserted the seventh key into the seventh lock , opened the chest , Harry screamed astonishedly . 
When looking at the chest , it was like looking down at an underground room , confused , and on the floor , three meters below , there was a sleeping man , apparently asleep , slender . just like being sick , that person is Moody Mighty - crazy guy . 
His wooden leg was removed , the eye socket would have had an empty eye under his eyelids , and each of his graying hair had been removed . 
Harry stared at him , stunned by the lightning bolt , eyeing Moody , who was sleeping in the chest , to the unconscious Moody on the floor of the office . 
Dumbledore climbed into the chest , swinging and jumping down beside Moody , who was sleeping on the floor in the chest . 
He looked down at Moody and said , 
The uncontrollable domination by the authoritative curse is very weak . 
Of course they need to sustain his life . 
Harry , throw the impersonator's cloak down here , he's cold . 
Mrs. Pomfrey had to examine him immediately , but in the immediate future he was not very critical . 
Harry did as Dumbledore said . 
Dumbledore covered Moody in a cloak around her , and climbed out of the chest . 
Then he picked up the medicine bottle on the desk , turned the beige button and pounced back . 
A thick liquid flows out , splashing on the floor of the office . 
Dumbledore said : 
This is a pandemic , Harry . 
You have seen its simple form and its outstanding form . 
Because Moody was just drinking water from his beard , he was famous for it . 
The fake name , of course , should keep Mr. Moody close by , so that he can continue to make pandemic flu vaccine . 
I saw Moody's hair 
Dumbledore looked down at Moody in the chest . 
Continue reading : 
The fake guy had to cut Moody's hair all year round , do not you see the hair grows unevenly ? 
But he thought , in the excitement of the night , the fake Moody probably forgot to take the medicine regularly , as he must have drunk every hour . 
Dumbledore pulled the chair by the table and sat down , his eyes staring at Moody on the floor . 
Harry stared at him too . 
Each minute passed in silence 
And then , with Harry's own eyes , the man's face on the floor began to change . 
The scars disappeared , the skin began to smoothen , the nose became intact and began to swell . 
The gray hair and gray hair fell on the skull and changed to straw . 
Suddenly , a clanging sound resounded , the wooden leg fell from him , and a normal leg soars up in the same spot , the eye throws out of the man's face at the same time a normal eye is in place . that . 
The eyeball rolls on the floor and continues to spin in all directions . 
Harry saw the man lying in front of him , pale skin , incense stick , golden hair . 
Harry knew who this guy was . 
He had seen him in Dumbledore's thought - tank , and watched as he was led by the Dementors of Azkaban out of the courtroom , where he persuaded Crouch to be innocent . But now around his eyes had wrinkles , and he looked older 
Outside the corridor sounded footsteps rushed . 
Snape comes back with Winky . 
Professor McGonagall has just come back behind them . 
Snape stood in the doorway , crying : 
Crouch ! 
Barty Crouch ! 
Professor McGonagall stood still , looking down at the man on the floor : 
Devilish Devil ! 
Unkempt clothes , tangled hair , Winky looked through Snape's legs . 
Her mouth was gasping and then she let out a shrill scream . 
Barty , Barty , why are you here ? 
The elf approached the man , holding his chest and shouting : 
You kill the master ! 
You kill the master ! 
You killed your boss's son ! 
Dumbledore said : 
He just fainted , Winky . 
Please stay aside . 
Severus , do you have that medicine ? 
Snape gave Dumbledore a small glass bottle of clear liquid . It's the Snape that Snape threatened Harry in class . 
Dumbledore stood up , leaned over the man on the floor , pulled him up , placed him against the wall beneath the Mirror . 
In that glass , Dumbledore's shadow , Professor Snape , and Professor McGonagall were still staring down at everyone . 
Winky was kneeling on the floor , trembling , his hands on his face . 
Dumbledore forced the man to open his mouth , filling his mouth with three drops of medicine . 
Then he pointed his wand at the man's chest , shouting : 
Ennervate ! 
Crouch's son opened his eyes . 
His face was sluggish , his look lost . 
Dumbledore knelt in front of him , leaving their faces even . 
Quietly asked : 
Did you hear me ? 
Blink of the man's eyes flashing . 
He murmured : 
Have . 
Dumbledore said softly : 
I want you to tell us how you got here . 
How did you escape the Azkaban Prison ? 
Crouch took a deep breath , shuddered , and began to speak in an emotionless voice : 
My mother saved me . 
She knew she was going to die . 
She convinced my father to save me , as the last gift he gave her . 
He loved her , but never loved me . 
He agreed . 
They came to visit me . 
They gave me a pandemic drug containing my mother's hair . 
My mother is taking pills with my hair . 
My mother and I changed their bodies . 
Winky shook her head shakily : 
Do not tell me , Barty , please do not tell me , and you will make your father in big trouble . 
But Crouch was taking another breath and continued in that flat voice . 
Dementors Azkaban are blind . 
They only perceive a healthy person and one dying to go to the Azkaban jail . 
Then they feel a healthy person and a dying person goes out there . 
My father brought me out , let me pretend to be my cheeks , in case some prisoners looked at us through the door to imprison them . 
Later , my mother died in Azkaban prisons . 
She carefully administered the multidisciplinary drug until she closed her eyes . 
She was buried under my body and under my surname . 
Everyone believes that she is me . 
The man's eyes flash again . 
Dumbledore quietly asked , 
What did your father do to you when he brought you home ? 
Arrays my mother's death . 
A private funeral , silent . 
The tomb bear my mother's name empty . 
An ejaculate cared for me . 
Then I was hiding . 
I was under control . 
My father uses some spells to subdue me . 
When I regain strength , I just think of going back . My master just thought of returning to his master . 
Dumbledore asked : 
How did your father succumb to you ? 
Crouch says : 
By arbitrary curse . 
I was always under my control . 
I was forced to wear a cloak all day and night . 
I always have an elf close to me . 
He is both a caretaker and a watchman . 
It pity me . 
He pleaded with my father to give me occasional privileges ; to reward my docile attitude . 
Winky's face sobbed sobs : 
Barty , you Barty , you should not tell them , we ' ll get into trouble for you 
Dumbledore asked gently : 
Has anyone discovered that you are still alive ? 
In addition to his father and his elf , who knew he was still alive ? 
Crouch said , eyelashes blink again : 
Yes . 
A witch in my dad's office . 
Bertha Jorkins . 
She brought papers to my father's house . 
My father is not at home . 
Winky put the bait in the house and came back to the kitchen with me . 
But Bertha Jorkins overhear Winky talking to me . 
She went to the kitchen to check . 
It was enough to guess who was hidden under the Invisibility Cloak . 
My father went home . 
My father's confrontation . 
He used a very strong worm to cast spells for her , causing her to forget all that she had discovered . 
He is too strong , too strong . 
He says his memory is permanently damaged . 
Winky sobbed : 
Why did not my nose work for my own employer ? 
Why do not you let us alone ? 
Dumbledore said : 
Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup . 
Crouch continued to speak in unison : 
Winky pleaded with me about it . 
It took him months to convince him . 
Every year I did not go out . 
I love Quidditch . 
Winky begged : let him go with . 
He will wear a cloak . 
He can watch the match . 
You can breathe fresh air one by one . 
He said that if she was my mother she would want me to go . He told my dad that my mother was dead to give me freedom . 
She did not die to keep me locked up in my house . 
Finally my father agreed . 
This is very well planned . 
Early in the morning , my dad led me and Winky on the honor stand . 
Winky pretends to keep it for my father . 
And I sit there , but invisible . 
When everyone left the stage we fled . 
Winky seems to go it alone . 
No one can know . 
But Winky did not know that I was becoming stronger than before . 
I began to resist my father's domineering curse . 
There are times when I almost return to myself . 
In short , I seem to be out of control of my dad . 
What happened on the honor stand for example . 
As if I came out from a deep sleep . 
I found myself in the middle of the crowd , in the middle of the match , and I saw , in front of me , a wand poked out of a boy's pocket . 
For a long time , I was not allowed to use the wand before I was cast into hell of Azkaban . 
Then I stole the wand . 
Winky does not know . 
Winky is afraid of heights . 
It does not dare to look at anything at all . 
Tears streamed through the fingers of his face , Winky crying billions : 
Barty , you're nuts ! 
Dumbledore continued : 
So you stole your wand , and what did you do with it ? 
Crouch says : 
We returned to the tent . 
Then we heard them . 
We hear the Death Eaters who do not sit in Azkaban . 
Those who do not suffer for my Master . 
They have turned away from you . 
They are not enslaved like me . 
They are free to look for the owner , but they do not do it . 
They only take the Muggles out for entertainment . 
Their enthusiasm woke me up . My mind has become clearer than ever in the past few years . 
I'm angry . 
I have a wand . 
I want to attack them for being unfaithful to my Master . 
My father was out of the tent ; He went to rescue the Muggle . 
Winky was scared to see me angry . 
It uses its magic ability to tie it and me together . 
He pulled me out of the tent , pulled me to the forest , away from the Death Eaters . 
I tried to pull it back . 
I want to go back to the campsite . 
I would like to give these Death Eaters a lesson about loyalty to the Dark Lord and punishing them for infidelity . 
I used the wand to call up the Dark Sign in the sky . 
Scouts of the Ministry of Magical . 
They shot everywhere . 
One of those spells came through the woods to where I and Winky were standing and it resolved the two of us . 
Both fainted . 
When he was back in his room , he knew I was probably nearby . 
He scoured the groves where Winky was found and he touched me lying there . 
Wait until the members of the Ministry of Magic leave the forest and re - cast me on the domineering curse and take me home . 
He ran Winky away . 
It was his trust . 
It allowed me to grasp a wand . 
He nearly let me escape . 
Winky burst into a cry of despair : 
I was alone at home with you . 
And then and then 
Crouch's head swiveled around on his neck , smirking a crazy smile on his face : 
My boss came to find me . 
He came to my house one evening , lying in the hands of a submarine named after the worm . 
My husband discovered that I was still alive . 
He arrested Bertha Jorkins in Albania . 
He tortured her . 
Acne reveals many things to him . 
She told him about the Magic Trilogy . 
She told him about the god of light named Moody's going to teach at Hogwarts . 
He tortured her so much that he overturned the charm that my dad had tasted . 
She told the Dark Lord that I had escaped the Azkaban Prison . 
She told him that my father had confined me in the house to stop me from looking for my employer . 
And so my master knew I was still his faithful servant - perhaps the most loyal . 
My boss outlined a plan based on the information Bertha Jorkins gave him . 
You need me . 
He came to our house at midnight . 
My father opened the door . 
The grin grew wider on Crouch's face , as if he were remembering his sweetest memory . Winky's crimson brown eyes fluttered slightly after a few fingers . 
It seemed too scary to say no . 
It happened very fast . 
My father was cursed by my master . So my father became a captive . 
My boss forced my father to go to work as usual , forcing him to act as if nothing had happened . 
And I was released . 
I awoke . 
I once again is me . 
Living for years without life . 
Dumbledore asked : 
And what did Voldemort ask you to do ? 
He asked if I was willing to risk everything for him . 
I am ready . To serve you , to prove my devoted devotion to you , is my dream , which is my greatest ambition . 
He told me that he needed to install a loyal servant at Hogwarts . 
A man who will guide Harry Potter to overcome the challenges of the Magic Trial without being suspected , one who can watch Harry Potter , ensures that he must reach the Magic Triangle . 
Turn the 
Cup to port , to bring the first person to touch the cup to my boss . 
But first 
Dumbledore's blue eyes glowed , though his voice remained calm : 
You need Alastor Moody . 
Worm tail and I do it . 
We have prepared the drug before the epidemic . 
Then I went to Moody's house . 
He resisted the sky . 
A landslide war . 
We subdued him just in time . 
Bring the old man in the chests of the old man . 
Dissolve some of his hair for a multi - fluid drug . 
I take medicine . 
I became a copy of Moody . 
I took off his leg and his eyes . 
I was prepared to meet Arthur Weasley when he came to deal with the Muggles who had heard of the disturbance . 
I made the garbage bins in the yard . 
I told Mr. Weasley that I heard an intruder in my yard , the intruders broke the trash can . 
Then I packed Moody's clothes together with the dark stuff , put down a whole chest with Moody , threw his domineering curse on me , so I could ask the old man to know about his past , Examine his habits , so that he can finally fool Dumbledore . 
I also need the hair of the old man , to make the drug multi - drug . 
Other materials are easier to find . 
I stole the snakeskin skin in the basement . 
When the poison master caught me in his office , I lied to the search warrant . 
Dumbledore asked : 
What did Worm tail do after you attacked Mr. Moody ? 
The worm's tail returned to take care of my master , in my father's house , and also to watch my father . 
Dumbledore said : 
But his father managed to escape . 
right . 
After some time he began to resist the domineering curse , as I had resisted it . 
There are times when he knows what's going on . 
My father decided that letting my father out of the house was not safe . 
He made him send letters to the Ministry instead of going to work himself . 
He forced him to write a letter saying he was ill . 
But Worm's tail dulled his mission . 
He was not careful enough . 
My father escaped . 
My guess is he will go to Hogwarts . 
My dad would tell Dumbledore something to confess . 
He will confess to have smuggled me out of Azkaban . 
My boss told me that my father had fled . He told me to stop him at all costs . 
So I waited and waited . 
I used the map I took from Harry Potter . 
That map nearly ruined everything . 
Dumbledore said quickly : 
Map ? 
What map ? 
Potter's Hogwarts School Map . 
Potter saw me on that map . 
Potter saw me stealing raw herbal medicine for the pills in Mr. Snape's office one evening . 
He thought I was my dad . 
I have the same father's name . 
I took Harry's map that night . 
I told him my dad hated Black Magician . 
Potter thought my father suspected Snape . 
For a week , I waited for my father to go to Hogwarts . 
Finally , one evening , the map showed my father walking into the school grounds . 
I came invisible cloak and went down to the school yard to welcome him . 
He went round the edge of the forest . 
Then Potter and Krum appear . 
I wait . 
I can not two Potter at the time , because my master needs it . 
Potter ran for Dumbledore . 
I made Krum unconscious . 
I killed my dad . 
Khkhkhkh 
Winky screamed . 
Barty , what are you talking about ? 
Dumbledore said , still in a soft voice : 
Did you kill your father ? 
What do you do with his body ? 
bring him in the forest . 
Cover your back with the Invisibility Cloak . 
I have a map . 
I see Potter in the castle . 
He met Snape . 
Then Dumbledore appeared . 
I watched Harry take Dumbledore out of the castle . 
I walked out of the forest , then around behind them , and came to see them . 
I told Dumbledore that Snape had told me where I was going . 
Dumbledore told me to go find my father . 
I went back to my father's place . 
I see the map . 
When everyone got out of the forest , I deformed my dad's body . 
He became a bonesman I buried in the Invisibility Cloak that buried the ground , in the new excavation site in front of Hagrid's hut . 
Now there is absolute calm , except Winky's whimper . 
Then Dumbledore said : 
And tonight 
Barty Crouch whispered : 
I propose to bring the Magic Triangle in the maze before dinner . 
Make it a Port Lock . 
My plan is effective . 
He returned to the mighty and I will be honored by him more than all the wizards ever dreamed . 
The mad smile radiated Crouch's face again , and his head fell to his shoulders while Winky crooned beside him . 
CHAPTER 36 THE EARTH DAY 
Dumbledore stood up . 
He stared at Barty Crouch for a moment , on the surface of disgust . 
Then he held up his wand again , and from the top of his wand he rode the ropes , automatically tied around Barty Crouch , and tightened his grip on him . 
You return to Professor McGonagall . 
Minerva , trouble her here guarding him so I can take Harry upstairs ? 
Professor McGonagall said : 
Of course . 
She seemed to want to vomit , as if seeing someone sick . 
However , when she pulled out her wand and pointed at Barty Crouch , she did not shake her hand at all . 
Severus - Dumbledore turns to Snape , " Would you please call Mrs. Pomfrey down here ? " We need to bring Alastor Moody to the hospital . 
Then he came out , looking for Mr. Cornelius Fudge , and brought him here . 
Surely he wanted to reconsider this Crouch name himself . 
And tell him I ' ll be in the clinic for about half an hour if he needs to see me . 
Snape nodded silently and quickly walked out . 
Dumbledore asked gently : 
How are you 
Harry sat up and felt dizzy ; He had forgotten his injured leg during the hearing Crouch said , and now his leg was too painful . 
He also realized that it was shaking . 
Dumbledore took his arm and led him to the dark corridor . 
You want to take me to your office first , Harry ? 
He spoke as they both turned to another corridor . 
Your Sirius is waiting there . 
Harry nodded . 
He felt as if he was livid and numb , but he was not worried but even happy . 
He does not want to think of anything that has happened since it touched the Magic Triangle . 
He did not want to think about the past , alive and clear as the photographs , constantly flashing in his head . 
Moody Eyes - crazy , lying in the chest . Worm tail , lying on the ground , holding arms . 
Voldemort , from the cauldron , in the steam . 
Cerdic dies Cerdic by sending his body back to his parents 
Sir . Harry is embarrassed . Where are the Diggory women ? 
They are with Professor Sprout . 
Dumbledore said . 
His voice , very calm during the interrogation of Barty Crouch , now a little choked . 
She is the teacher of Cerdic's House , and she knows her best . 
They went to the stone gutters . 
Dumbledore read the password , the trolley to the side , and Harry and Harry walked up the spiral staircase to the oak door . 
Dumbledore pushed the door open . 
Sirius was standing there . 
His face was white and haggard as he remembers escaping from Azkaban . 
Wading quickly to Harry . 
Harry , are you alright ? 
Did you hear what happened , Harry ? 
Hands trembled as Harry sat down at the desk in front of the desk . 
Prompted : 
what happened ? 
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius what all Barth Crouch had said . 
Harry just listened to the dream . 
He was tired , he burned the bones in his body , he just wanted to sit here , no one asked anything , every hour , until he fell asleep , and not hear or worry . . 
There was a slight flutter . 
The phoenixes Fawkes leave their branches , flies across the room to park on Harry's knees . 
Hello Fawkes ! 
Said Harry softly . 
He stroked the beautiful yellow feathers of the phoenix . 
Fawkes glanced up serenely at him . 
Something very pleasant emanates from this warm phoenix . 
Dumbledore stopped talking . 
He sat down behind the desk , facing Harry . 
He looked at it , and he avoided his eyes . 
You're going to ask him out . 
You are going to make it back to everything . 
Dumbledore said , 
Harry , you need to know what happened when you picked up the Lock Key in the maze . 
Can we get to the brightest , teacher ? 
Said Sirius , hoarsely . 
He placed his hand on Harry's shoulder . 
let it sleep . Let it rest . 
Harry's heart was full of Sirius , but Dumbledore did not care what he said . 
You lean toward Harry . 
With great reluctance , Harry raised his head and looked at his blue eyes . 
Dumbledore said softly , 
If you think you can help me , by giving me a great sleep and allowing me to come tomorrow to think about all that has happened tonight , you did . 
But he also knows that numbing can be painful for a while , but then it gets worse . 
I have shown more courage than the expectations of teachers . 
I ask you again to show your courage . 
He asked me to tell everyone what had happened . 
The phoenix singing a melody , melodious . 
The music was in the air , and Harry felt like there was a hot dripping from his neck to his stomach , making him warm , making him feel good . 
He took a deep breath and began to recount . 
As it said , all that it had seen in the night seemed to be in front of him , he saw Voldemort revive from the glowing water ; He saw the Death Eaters appear among the surrounding tombs ; He saw Cerdic's body , lying on the ground next to the cup . 
Sirius ' hand still holds Harry's shoulders . 
Several times , he determined to say something , but Dumbledore put his hand back . 
Harry was glad he did , because it was easier said than done at the beginning . 
Expressing relief ; It felt like there was some poison in the person being drawn . 
He is determined to continue , he also thought that when finished it would feel more comfortable . 
However , when Harry mentioned the worm's tail stabbed the dagger in his arm , Sirius turned out an angry cry , and Dumbledore stood up , causing Harry to start . 
Dumbledore walked around the table and told her to stretch her arms . 
Harry points to the two of them looking at the torn sleeve and the wound below . 
Harry told Dumbledore : 
He said that using his blood would make him stronger than anyone else's blood . 
He said he would also have the protection - which my cheeks left behind . 
And he was right - he had touched the baby without harm , he touched his face . 
Harry felt a glimpse in Dumbledore's eyes , something like joy . 
But right after that , it must have been my imagination , because when I got back to the chair behind the desk , I looked old and tired as ever . 
He said as he sat back down : 
Well , Voldemort has overcome this particular obstacle . 
Harry , keep going . 
Harry continued ; It tells how Voldemort emerged from the cauldron , telling him everything he could remember from Voldemort's words to the Death Eaters . 
Then he told Voldemort he had untied it , returned it to his wand , and prepared for the duel . 
But when it comes to the piece of light that has connected its wand and Voldemort's stick together , his throat chokes . 
He tried again , but in his head was filled with ghosts emerging from Voldemort's wand . 
It was as if Cerdic appeared , and then an old man , Bertha Jorkins , blew his cheeks 
The two wands stick together ? Sirius asked , breaking the silence . 
He looked at Harry and looked at Dumbledore again . 
Why so ? 
Harry looked up at Dumbledore , who looked amused . 
Mumbled : 
Priori Incantatem ( Meaning : Mantras Ever ! ) 
She stared at Harry's eyes , as if between her and him with some invisible symmetry . 
Sirius cried out : 
Effective Reverse Charms ? 
Exactly . 
Said Dumbledore . 
The two wands of Harry and Voldemort have the same origin . 
Each tree has a feather tail of the same phoenix . 
He pointed to the fire - bellied bird sitting on Harry's knee , adding : 
Actually , this is the phoenix itself . 
Harry asked with astonishment : 
Your wand made of Fawkes feathers ? 
Dumbledore said : 
Yes , as soon as I got out of his shop four years ago , Mr. Ollivander wrote to me that he had bought his second wand . 
Sirius asked : 
So what happens when two wands meet ? 
Dumbledore said : 
They will not listen to each other to fight against each other . 
But if the owners of two wands try to fight them , sometimes they are effective . 
One of the two wands will catch the other spit out all the curses it has made - in the opposite direction . First is the latest curse and then turn to the next sentence after 
He looked at Harry inquiringly , and Harry nodded . 
And that is , he said slowly , his eyes still looking at Harry , some form of Cerdic had been reproduced . 
Harry nodded again . 
Sirius exclaimed : 
Diggory resurrected ? 
Dumbledore said firmly . 
No spell can make the dead resurrected , all that has happened is a resounding echo . 
A shadow of Cerdic while alive might have escaped from the tip of a chopstick , did not he say Harry was right ? 
Said Harry , his voice suddenly trembling : 
He talked to Brother Cerdic , whether it was ghosts or whatever , he talked to his son . 
Dumbledore said : 
It was a disappointment of form and Cerdic's personality was not lost . 
I guess there are other shapes that also appear before Voldemort's victims 
His throat was dry , Harry said : 
An old man , Mrs. Bertha Jorkins , and 
Dumbledore kindly asked : 
Your cheeks , right ? 
Harry said : 
Yes . 
Sirius hugged Harry's shoulder so that it felt pain . 
Dumbledore nodded . 
The last murders that the wand made . 
In reverse order . 
Of course there will be more unholy appearances , if you maintain the connection of the two wands . 
Very well , Harry , those echoes , those unforgivings they do ? 
Harry describes how those ghosts appeared from the end of the chopsticks and screamed around the edge of the golden archway , Voldemort had shown how scary the ghosts were , how his ghost had taught him What to do , and the ghost of Cerdic uttered his last wish . 
Now , Harry could not continue . 
She turned to look at Sirius and saw him buried his face in both hands . 
Harry suddenly realizes that the phoenix Fawkes has left his knee . 
The phoenix flew to the floor . 
It was redeeming its beautiful head on Harry's wound , and the tears of the phoenix's fall fell to the wound of the giant spider that had caused Harry's leg . The wound had disappeared . 
Da immediately seemed immediately . The legs of Harry suddenly heal as normal . 
As the phoenix took off in the air and landed on a golden tree near the door , Dumbledore said , 
He said again : I have shown more courage than anything you expected me to do tonight , Harry . 
I have shown bravery similar to those who fought Voldemort to death when he was at the height of his power . 
I have burdened the responsibility of a mature mage on my shoulders and have shown that I can shoulder my shoulders with strength and now you have given me authority to expect you . 
I will go with you to sick . 
You do not want to let me go to bed tonight . One dose of Smurf , a little peace of Sirius , would you like to stay with me ? 
Sirius nodded and stood up . 
He transforms into a big black dog and walks with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office , they go down the stairs together to the hospital . 
When Dumbledore pushes the door of the sickness out . 
Harry saw Mrs. Weasley , Bill , Ron , and Hermione gather around a pompous Mrs. Pomfrey . 
It seems everyone is asking where Harry is and what is happening to him . 
Harry walked in with Dumbledore and the black dog , all of whom lunged around , and Mrs. Weasley uttered a scream : 
Harry Potter ! 
Oh , my dear Harry ! 
Mrs. Weasley rushed over to Harry , but Dumbledore stood in front of Harry . 
He put out a hand to show , saying : 
Miss Molly , listen to me for a moment . Harry had suffered a terrible test this evening . 
Tell me about it . 
What he needs now is a sleep , peace and quiet . 
Looking around Ron , Hermione and Bill , added : 
If all of you want to stay with Harry , you can stay . 
But I do not want you to question Harry too much , wait until he's ready to answer , but I'm sure he's not in tonight . 
Mrs. Weasley nodded . 
She was no longer pale . 
She turned to Ron , Hermione and Bill , as if they were loud , she whispered : 
Did you hear ? 
Harry needs quiet ! 
Pomfrey glared at the big black dog , Sirius's fake , she asked : 
Dear principal , allow me to ask 
Dumbledore said simply : 
This dog will stay with Harry for a while . 
I assure you , this dog has been thoroughly trained . 
Harry , you will wait when you go to bed . 
Harry felt overwhelmed by Dumbledore's gratitude for asking him not to ask him anything . 
It is not that he does not want other people there , but thinking about having to re - explain everything , reviving things again , is unbearable . 
Dumbledore says : 
I ' ll come back to see you , Harry , when you meet Mr. Fudge . 
You want me to stay here all day , until you talk to the whole school . 
Dumbledore left the sick room . 
When Mrs. Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed , she caught up with Mr. Moody lying motionless on a bed at the back of the office . 
His teacher's wooden leg and the magical eye are placed on the side of the bed . 
Harry asked : 
Are you okay ? 
Mrs. Pomfrey handed Harry her pajamas and put it on the bed . 
She said : 
He will recover soon . 
Harry took off his shirt , put on his pajamas , and went to bed . 
Ron , Hermione , Bill , Mrs. Weasley , and the black dog all pulled to the side of the screen and made their own seats on the chairs that were placed on either side of Harry's bed . 
Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously , as if afraid of it . 
And he said , 
I'm fine . 
Only tired . 
Mrs. Weasley's eyes were filled with tears as she pulled back the sheets unnecessarily . 
Mrs. Pomfrey , who had just fled from the sick room to her room , now returned with a small bottle of purple medicine , and she carried a glass . 
She said : 
You need to drink it , Harry . This is a dream sleeping pill . 
Harry held the glass and took a few sips . 
He felt sleepy right away . 
Everything around it seemed ambiguous ; the bulbs in the vagina seem to blink with it intimately through the bed curtain ; Its body seems to sink deeper and deeper into the warmth of the mattress . 
Before she drank the dose of sleeping pills , before she could say a word , tired exhaustion brought it deep into sleep . 
When Harry wakes up , feels very warm , and is very sleepy , so he does not open his eyes , but just wants to keep his eyes closed and sleep . 
Room illuminated dim ; It must have been at night , and it felt like it had just taken a nap . 
Then he heard the whisper around him . 
They do not hold back , they make Harry wake up to see . 
What are they shouting ? What else happens ? 
Harry glared blindly . 
Someone removed his glasses . 
He only saw Mrs. Weasley's dim lines and Bill's side . 
Mrs. Weasley stood up . 
She whispered : 
It sounded like Mr. Fudge's voice . 
Mrs. McGonagall's voice , right ? 
But what are they arguing about ? Now Harry was able to hear the quarrel . 
People scream and run towards the ventricular . 
Mr. Cornelius Fudge shouted : It's a pity , Mrs. Minerva , but it's the same 
Professor McGonagall screamed : 
He should never have taken that into the castle ! 
When Dumbledore knew it 
Harry heard the sick door open . 
The people around Harry's bed glared at the door , and Bill hurried to Harry's bed screen , and , as no one noticed it , Harry sat up and wiped his glasses . 
Mr. Fudge strode straight in the sick room . 
Professor McGonagall and Snape followed him . 
Mr. Fudge asked Mrs. Weasley : 
Where is Dumbledore ? 
Mrs. Weasley was angry : 
You are not here . This is sickness , Minister , you do not see it 
But the door was opened , and Dumbledore was fast in the room . 
Mr. Fudge looked at Mrs. McGonagall , and asked , 
What happened ? 
Why are you harassing these people here ? 
Mrs. Minerva , she surprised me , I asked her to watch over Barty Crouch 
Professor McGonagall shrieked . 
Dumbledore , no need to guard him anymore . 
The minister is here already resolved . 
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose his temper . 
On the cheek of her raised angry red , and her hands clenched into fists ; and she was trembling with anger . 
Snape , with a slight voice , explained : 
When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater causing the incident this evening , he seemed to feel that his personal security was a problem . 
He persisted in summoning an Azkaban Dementor to accompany him to the castle . 
He brought the dreadlord to the office where Barty Crouch was guarded 
Professor McGonagall said : 
I told him that Dumbledore would not agree . 
I told him that he would never allow the Dementor of Azkaban to set foot inside the castle , but 
Mr. Fudge growled , looking even fiercer , Harry had never seen him so angry : 
Dear sir , as Minister of Magic , I have the power to decide whether I want to bring a guardian when I go to interrogate a prisoner that can be very dangerous . 
But Professor McGonagall's voice was overrun with Mr. Fudge's voice . 
She screamed , pointing to Mr. Fudge , trembling in his body : 
Just when the name came into the room , he bent down to Crouch and 
Harry felt a chilly gulp when Professor McGonagall was looking for a word to describe what had happened . 
He did not need Miss McGonagall to finish the sentence . 
He knew what the Dukes of Azkaban would do 
did . 
They put their deadly kiss on Barty Crouch . 
They sucked his soul through his mouth . 
Now Crouch is worse than dying . 
Mr. Fudge threatened loudly : 
After all , he is not a pity . 
Maybe he was responsible for a lot of death ! 
But now he can not testify . 
Mr. Cornelius . 
Dumbledore said . 
He glared at Fudge as if for the first time he had clearly seen him . 
He continued : 
He can no longer give evidence as to why he killed those people . 
Mr. Fudge yelled : 
Why did he kill those people ? 
Well , what's the secret ? 
He is a crazy fanatic ! 
Based on what McGonagall and Snape have told me , it seems that he thinks he's doing all that on the orders of the Who - Who - knows - Who ! 
Dumbledore said : 
It was Voldemort who ordered him , Mr. Fudge . 
Those deaths are only a side effect of Voldemort's massive revival of power . 
The plan was successful . 
Voldemort recovered his body . 
He looked at Fudge's face as if someone had just thrown a weight in his face . 
Shocked and blinked , he looked back at Dumbledore as if he could not believe what he had just heard . 
He looked up at Dumbledore , started stammering : 
Who - knows - who - is - who ? 
Extremely ridiculous ! 
Stop it . 
Dumbledore 
Mrs. McGonagall and Mr. Snape were sure to tell you , we heard Barty Crouch confess . 
Due to the influence of the Pill , he told us how he had been smuggled out of the Azkaban jail ; and Voldemort thanks Bertha Jorkins for knowing how alive he was , having freed him from his father's house and using him to kidnap Harry . 
I told him that the plan was successful . 
Crouch has rescued Voldemort . 
Harry noticed a slight smile on Mr. Fudge's face . 
He said : 
Dumbledore , you can not really believe that story like that . 
Who - knows - well - who's back ? 
Well , stop it , Crouch can claim to have acted on the orders of the Who - who - knows - who - but believe in the words of a crazy guy like that , Dumbledore ? 
Dumbledore said firmly : 
When Harry touched the triple Trophy Cup , it was routed directly to Voldemort . 
It has witnessed the revival of Lord Voldemort . 
I will explain all that to you if you go too far through my office . 
Dumbledore glanced back , realizing Harry was awake , but he shook his head and said , 
I'm afraid I can not allow you to question Harry tonight . 
Fudge's curious smile faltered . 
He also glanced at Harry and went back to tell Dumbledore : 
Will you believe in Harry's words about this , Dumbledore ? 
Everyone was silent for a moment , only Sirius's growl . 
The ruffled feather of his neck , the frosty summer with Fudge . 
Dumbledore's eyes were bright now : 
Of course I believe Harry . 
I heard Crouch's confession , and I heard Harry tell what had happened after it touched on the Magic Triangle ; These two stories are meaningful , they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer . 
Mr. Fudge still holds a strange smile on his face . 
Again he glanced at Harry before answering : 
You have decided that Lord Voldemort has come back , but based on the words of a mad man , 
Mr. Fudge looked at Harry again , and Harry suddenly understood . 
She quietly said : 
Did you read Rita Skeeter's article , did not Mr. Fudge ? 
Ron , Hermione , Mrs. Weasley and Bill were startled . 
None of them realized that Harry was awake . 
Mr. Fudge blushed slightly , but on the face still stubborn defiance . 
He looked at Dumbledore , saying : 
And what if I read ? 
If I discovered that some time ago still keep some truth about him ? 
A bilingual child , right ? 
And it's a farce 
Dumbledore said coldly : 
I understand that you are referring to the pain that Harry experienced with his scars ? 
Mr. Fudge said quickly : 
So you recognize that it has these pain ? 
Headache ? 
Dreaming ? 
Could it be illusion ? 
Dumbledore took a step toward Mr. Fudge , and again , at what seemed to emit the power that Harry had seen just after the unconscious Crouch child . 
He said : 
Listen to me , Mr. Fudge . 
Harry soberly like him , like me . 
The scar on her forehead does not affect her brains . 
I believe the scar made it painful when Lord Voldemort came near it , or when it felt a particular murder . 
Mr. Fudge took a half step to dodge Dumbledore , but he was no less stubborn : 
Forgive me , Dumbledore , but I have never heard of a cursed scars that turn into an alarm bell . 
Harry screamed : 
Damn , I saw Lord Voldemort revive ! 
He tried to get out of bed again , but Mrs. Weasley pressed it down , he yelled : 
I saw the Death Eaters ! 
You can name them ! 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy 
Snape's teacher had a startling movement , but when Harry looked at him , Snape's eyes returned to Mr. Fudge . 
Mr. Fudge was insulted , saying : 
Mr. Malfoy's case has been clarified ! It is a long line of generous donations to the noble cause 
Harry continued to say : 
Macnair ! 
Well have been clarified ! 
Now working for the Ministry ! 
Avey - Nott - Crabbe - Goyle . 
Fudge said , 
I only repeat the names of those who have separated the Death Eaters fifteen years ago ! 
You can find those names in the old reports at court hearings ! 
instruments 
Dumbledore , please blessed . Last year , this kid also thought of all the bizarre stories of its becoming more a myth , but still listening to this child can say Dumbledore , do you still think it's believable ? 
Professor McGonagall exclaimed : 
You're crazy ! First is Cerdic Diggory , then Crouch ! 
Those deaths can not simply be a random act of a madman ! 
Mr. Fudge also shouted : 
I do not see any evidence against it ! 
Now his anger is equal to Mrs. McGonagall's anger , his face purple : 
I feel like everyone is determined to stir up a panic that will upset everything that we have set up for thirteen years ! 
Harry could not believe what he was hearing . 
He always thought of Mr. Fudge as a kind , a bit pompous , a bit noisy , but good nature . 
But now standing in front of him was an angry dwarf , insisting not to accept the prospect that his orderly and comfortable world was about to collapse , believing that Lord Voldemort could rise . 
Dumbledore repeated : 
Voldemort has come back , Mr. Fudge , if you honestly accept this truth , and take the necessary measures , we will still be able to save the situation . 
The first and most important step is to get rid of the Dementors from the Azkaban Prison 
Mr. Fudge shouted again : 
Nonsense . Get rid of the dementors ? 
I just made that proposal to be kicked out of the office right away ! 
Half of us just feel safe in bed every night because we know the dementors are standing in Azkaban prison ! 
Dumbledore said : 
And all the rest of us , like us , could not sleep on the bed , Mr. Fudge , knowing that he had entrusted Lord Voldemort's most loyal underlings to some of the monsters ready to follow him . he calls them . 
They will not keep your loyalty , Mr. Fudge ! 
Lord Voldemort can promise them more opportunities for power and pleasure than he can give them ! 
If the Prisoners of the Lord Voldemort , and their former agents return to him , he would have been hard pressed to prevent him from regaining the kind of power he had had thirteen years ago ! 
Mr. Fudge opened his mouth and shut his mouth as if there was no word to describe his anger . 
Dumbledore continued to emphasize : 
The second step he had to do immediately , was the messenger to meet the giants . 
Mr. Fudge yelled , shrieking , 
Mission messenger to meet the giants ? 
What crazy thing ? 
Dumbledore said : 
Show them a friendly hand , right now , before it's too late . 
Otherwise , Lord Voldemort will convince them that he is the only mage who can give them rights and freedoms , as he did before ! 
Mr. Fudge gasped , shaking his head and backing away from Dumbledore : 
You can not stress like that ! 
If the magic community heard that I had approached the giants , I would have lost my job . Dumbledore , the people hated them so much . 
Now Dumbledore's voice rose , the halo of power around him became clear , his eyes glowing again : 
You're wrong , Mr. Fudge , your ignorance has blinded you . 
For years he has always been so considerate of what he calls pure bloodlines ! 
He did not realize that the background of people is not a problem , but it is the effort of man is important ! 
The dementors have just destroyed the last remaining member of a purebred and ancient family like any other purebred family . And think about what kind of life Crouch has chosen for him ! 
Now I tell you to take immediately the measures that I propose , and you will be remembered as one of the greatest and greatest brave ministers we know , whether he whether to retain it or not . 
And if you do not take action , history will recognize you as the one who jumped on the sidelines and let Lord Voldemort have a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild . 
Mr. Fudge retorted , whispering : 
Madly crazy 
And everyone was silent . 
Pomfrey stood at the foot of Harry's bed , his hands clenched . 
Mrs. Weasley was still standing on Harry , her hands on her shoulders to keep her from getting up . Bill , Ron , and Hermione both looked at Mr. Fudge . 
Dumbledore said : 
If he's still determined to keep his eyes shut , Mr. Fudge , we can turn our heads away . 
He acted in whatever way he found fit . 
And I will act my way . 
Dumbledore's voice did not contain any threat , it just sounded like a statement , but Fudge poured in a pose ready to fight , as if Dumbledore was holding his wand against him . . 
He threw his fingers forward threateningly : 
Hey , Dumbledore , watch out . 
Any time now , I always let myself do things myself . 
I have great respect for you . 
I might disagree with many of your decisions , but I still silent . 
Not many people let him use the werewolf or the old Hagrid , or decide what to teach his students without consultation with the Ministry of Magic . 
But if you are against me 
Dumbledore said : 
The only one I intend to fight is Lord Voldemort . 
If you are against him , Mr. Fudge , we are still in the same faction . 
It seemed as if Mr. Fudge could not think of an answer , he leaned back on his little legs for a moment , his hands twisting the cantaloupe - shaped cap . 
Finally he said in a pleading voice : 
He can not return to Dumbledore , he simply can not 
Mr. Snape strode forward , passing Dumbledore , as he walked up the left sleeve . 
He raised his arm and showed Fudge the view , causing him to cringe . 
Said Snape , with a harsh voice : 
there . that is the Dark Sign . 
It was not as clear as it was an hour ago , but it was still dark , but he could still see it , all the Death Eaters showing signs of Dark Lord pressing . It was a way to distinguish one from the other , and also the way Lord Voldemort summoned us . 
When he touched the sign of any Death Eater , we had to land , or ascend , to his side . 
Throughout the year this sign has become more and more apparent . 
The sign of Mr. Karkaroff is the same . 
Do you know why Karkaroff ran away tonight ? 
We both felt the Dark Sign , both of us knew he was back . 
Mr Karkaroff feared the Dark Lord of revenge . 
He betrayed so many Death Eaters , he was not sure he would be welcomed back . 
Mr. Fudge also stepped away from Snape . 
He shook his head . 
It seemed as if he could not believe a word Snape had said , glaring at the ugly sign on Snape's arm with obvious disgust , then looked up at Dumbledore , whispering , 
I do not know what stuff and school teachers are playing , Dumbledore , but I think that's enough . 
I have no more words to say . 
I will contact you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the administration of this school . 
I have to go back to the Ministry of Magic here . 
He walked close to the door then stopped . 
He strode across the room , stopping at Harry's bed . 
He took out a large bag of gold from his pocket on the table next to Harry's bed and said , 
Bonus of the game . 
One thousand Galeon . 
There should be an awards ceremony , but in this situation 
He took the hat on his head and left the room , closing the door behind him . 
When he was gone , Dumbledore turned to see the group of people standing around Harry's bed . 
He said : 
There is one thing to do . 
Mrs. Molly , are you thinking , if I'm going to rely on you and Arthur ? 
Mrs. Weasley was pale to her lips , but resolutely , she said , 
Of course he was . 
We know Mr. Fudge too . 
Arthur Arthur also left to stay in the Ministry of Magic for a few years because he cares about the Muggle . 
Mr. Fudge thought he lacked the proper mage's pride . 
Dumbledore said : 
Then we need instant message for Arthur . 
All of whom we can convince them of the truth must be informed right away , and Arthur is in a favorable position to interact with those in the Ministry of Magic , who do not despair . just like Mr. Fudge . 
Bill stood up , saying : 
I ' ll go see you . 
You go now . 
Dumbledore said : 
Very good ! 
Let's tell them what happened . 
Tell your dad that he will contact you soon . 
But he also needs to be discreet . 
If Mr. Fudge thinks we are interfering with the Ministry of Magic 
Bill said : 
He gave it to me . 
Bill patted Harry on the shoulder , kissed Mrs. Weasley's cheek , put on his jacket , and strode quickly out of the room . 
Dumbledore returned to Professor McGonagall : 
Mrs. Minerva , I want to meet Mr. Hagrid in my office , as soon as possible . 
And I would like to invite - if she please - invite Mrs. Maxime again . 
Professor McGonagall nodded and walked out , not saying a word . 
Dumbledore told Pomfrey , 
Poppy , please go down to Professor Moody's office , I think there you will find an elk named Winky who is in a state of depression . 
Do something you can do for her , and bring her down to the kitchen . 
I believe Dobby will take care of her better than us . 
Mrs. Pomfrey was astonished , but she said : 
okay 
Then Mrs. Pomfrey left the room . 
Dumbledore checked to see if the door had closed , and then let Pomfrey's footsteps get away , and he continued : 
Now is the time for the two of us to recognize each other . 
Sirius please return to normal shape . 
The huge black dog looked up at Dumbledore , and in a flash , shivered into a man . 
Mrs. Weasley screamed and jumped back from the bed . 
She pointed at Sirius , screaming : 
Sirius Black ! 
Shouted Ron : 
Oh , do not cry ! 
It's okay . 
Snape did not scream , nor did he jump back , but his face was filled with terror . 
Snape looked at Sirius , growling : 
He 
What is he doing here ? 
Sirius also expresses a similar distaste for Snape . 
Dumbledore looked at both of them , saying : 
Sirius came here because of me , just like you , Snape . 
I trust both of you . It's time for you to put aside the past differences to trust each other . 
Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a miracle . 
Sirius and Snape looked at each other for lack of fresh food to eat . 
Dumbledore continued with a voice that was unbearable : 
I will resolve , in a short time , to shelter public hatred . 
Let's shake hands . 
Now they are on the same side . 
Time is scarce , and if some of us , who know the truth , are not united , then we have no hope . 
Sirius and Snape walked slowly together - still glaring at each other as if he was not expecting more than the other demon - and they shook hands . 
Then they let go of each other quickly . 
Dumbledore stepped again to stand between them : 
So can continue to cooperate with each other . 
Now I have a job assignment for both of you : Fudge's attitude , though not unexpected , has also changed things . 
Sirius , I need you to leave immediately . 
He must warn the witches Remus Lupine , Arbella Figg , Mundungus Fletcher the old crowd . 
Be hidden at Lupine for a while . 
I will contact you in that place . 
Harry said : 
But 
She wants Sirius to stay . 
He did not want to break up with Sirius so quickly . 
Sirius turned to Harry and patted : 
I ' ll see you soon , promise me . 
But you also understand , you have to do what you can do , right ? 
Harry said : 
Well , of course I understand . 
Sirius grasped his hand briefly , nodded at Dumbledore , transformed into a giant black dog , running across the room , to the door , using his forefinger to open the doorknob . 
Then disappears . 
Dumbledore turned to Snape : 
Mr. Severus , you know the job I have to give you . 
If he is ready if he is prepared 
Snape said , 
I was prepared . 
He looked slightly pale than usual , but his cool black eyes sparkled in a strange way . 
Dumbledore said : 
Then I wish you good luck . 
Dumbledore watched with a faint smile on his face , as Snape walked away without saying a word . 
Several minutes passed before Dumbledore spoke again : 
I have to go downstairs . 
I have to meet the Diggory family . 
Harry , remember to drink your medicine . 
I will see everyone again . 
When Dumbledore was gone , Harry collapsed onto the pillow . 
Hermione , Ron and Mrs. Weasley are still looking at it . 
Now they have voiced their silence until now . 
Mrs. Weasley finally said : 
Harry , I have to drink all my medicine . 
When she reached for the bottle and the glass , her hands touched the golden bag on Harry's bedside table . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
I will sleep a long drunk . 
Try to think of other things for a moment to think about what you will buy with your bonus money 
Harry said , without a trace of expression : 
I do not need that gold . 
You keep the baby . 
Someone can take it away . 
I would not have won . 
The reward should belong to Mr. Cerdic . 
The thing that has struggled many times since it left the maze until now is to beat it . 
It can feel a burning pain in the corner of the eye . 
He blinked , looking at the ceiling . 
Mrs. Weasley whispered : 
not my fault Harry ! 
Harry said : 
I show the trophy with the children . 
Now the burning sensation spreads to his throat . 
It was hoping for Ron to look away . 
Mrs. Weasley put the bottle down on the bedside couch , bent down , wrapped her arms around Harry . 
It is not remembered in the life it was ever hugged as mother hugged like this never . 
The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall on him as Mrs. Weasley embraced it 
inside . 
The face of his mother , his father's voice , Cerdic's image lying dead on the ground , all began to spin in his head until it could no longer bear , until his face crumpled . To try to squeeze a squeak of pain out of him . 
With a loud , open door , Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry . 
Hermione was standing by the window . 
She was holding something in her arms . 
Little girl said : 
Sorry . 
Mrs. Weasley held her hand to wipe her eyes , saying quickly : 
Take medication to Harry . 
Harry drank a little . 
The effect of sleeping pills does not occur instantaneously . 
Severe sleepiness can not resist shooting down Harry's eyes . 
He buried his head in his pillow and did not think any more . 
CHAPTER 37 BACKGROUND 
It took months to recapture Harry's memories of the days after that night . 
Looks like the memory is saturated , can not receive anymore . 
The memories of it are very painful . 
But perhaps the worst thing was the meeting with the Diggory family the next morning . 
They did not blame Harry for what had happened ; On the contrary , both Diggory thanked them for bringing Cerdic's body to them . 
Mr. Diggory sobbed crooningly throughout the conversation . 
Diggory's grief seemed to have dried her tears . 
When Harry told her how Cerdic had died , she said : 
So it hurt a little . 
And after all , Mr. Amos was dead after winning the Magic Trial . 
She must be very happy . When they got up , Diggory looked down at Harry and said , " Now take care of your son . 
Harry grasped the golden bag on the bedside table . 
He whispered to Mrs. Diggory : 
I take this . 
It should be Cerdic's . 
He goes there first , take him 
But Diggory backed off : Oh no , that's mine , baby . 
You can not keep it . 
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening . 
Based on what Hermione and Ron had told him , Dumbledore had spoken to the whole school that morning in the morning . 
He just asked Harry to leave , no question asked Harry , do not force it to tell what happened in the maze . 
Harry noticed that most people avoided it in the corridor , avoiding even looking into his eyes . 
Some cover their mouths whisper as it passes by . 
He speculated that many of those people believed in Rita Skeeter's article about how it was mentally disordered and potentially dangerous . 
Perhaps they are embroidering the hypothesis of Cerdic's death . 
Harry did not bother to look at it . 
It is most liked when it is with Ron and Hermione to talk about other things , or when Ron and Hermione play chess together and let Harry sit quietly alone . 
Harry felt as though the three of them had reached a sympathy that they did not need to say in words ; 
Each of you is waiting for a sign or a word of something going on outside of Hogwarts , and until they know something is certain , then at this moment , the speculations about what Can happen just superfluous . 
The only time they talked about Voldemort's revived theme and when Ron told Harry about the Weasley meeting with Dumbledore before she returned home , Ron said , 
Mama came to ask Dumbledore for permission to let you go straight home this summer . 
But Dumbledore wants you back to the Dursleys , at least initially . 
Harry asked : 
Why ? 
Ron shakes his head mysteriously : 
My daddy told me that Dumbledore was right . 
I think we must believe in him too , right ? 
Aside from Ron and Hermione , the only person Harry felt could speak was Hagrid . 
Because there is no Dark Arts Preacher , they are free at school . 
They went down to see Hagrid in his hut on an empty Thursday afternoon . it was a sunny day ; Dog Fang pulled out the open door as they approached , barking and wagging their tails as crazy . 
Hagrid went to the door , calling out : 
Who's that ? 
Harry Potter ! 
He strode to meet them , hugging Harry with one hand , stroking his hair and saying , 
Meet the grandson too happy . To meet you is really good . 
Entering Hagrid's hut , they saw two large cups with a bucket and two plates on a wooden table in front of the fireplace . 
Said Hagrid . 
You have just had tea with Mrs. Olympe . 
She just left . 
Ron asked curiously : 
Who are you ? 
Said Hagrid . 
Of course Maxime ! 
Said Ron : 
So are you two hired ? 
Said Hagrid in a dreamy voice . 
Do you know what they are talking about ? 
He took the cup in the drawer . 
After he had finished making tea and holding up a plate of hardened pancakes , he sat back down on his chair and scrutinized Harry with his dark eyes . 
He asked . 
Are you okay ? 
Harry said : 
Yes . 
Said Hagrid . 
No , I'm not . 
Of course not . 
But then you will be fine again . 
Harry did not say anything . 
Hagrid said , 
He knew that he would return . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione looked up at Hagrid with astonishment . 
Hagrid continued : 
You've known Harry for a long time . 
Know that he is still out there , now . 
That he must have resurrected . 
Well , now that it's happened , we ' ll just have to deal with it . 
We will have to fight , perhaps to stop him before he gains the upper hand . 
Anyway , that was Dumbledore's plan . 
Dumbledore was a great man . 
As long as we have a neighbor , we do not need to worry too much . 
Hagrid raised his thick eyebrows at the unbelieving expression on his face . 
He said again : 
And worrying about that is not good enough . 
What will happen will happen , and when it happens we will deal . 
Dumbledore told me what he did , Harry . 
Hagrid's chest boomed proudly as he looked at Harry . 
I have done many things like my father would do in the same case , and I could not make any better compliments to him about that . 
Harry smiled at Hagrid . 
It was the first time in several days , Harry had smiled a smile . 
She asked : 
Uncle Hagrid , what did Dumbledore tell you to do ? 
Professor McGonagall invited Dr . and Mrs. Maxime to see him that night . 
Said Hagrid . 
I gave him a small job in the summer . 
But it's secret . 
Uncle is not allowed to tell anyone , even with the children . 
Mrs. Olympe , that is Mrs. Maxime , may be coming to work with you . 
I believe she will come to you . 
Believe you convinced her . 
Does that have anything to do with Voldemort ? 
Hagrid frowned at the name . 
He said vaguely . 
Can anybody want to go see the doctor to visit the last tails Monster ? 
But then they saw their faces , he added hurriedly : 
You just kidding 
In the dormitory bedroom the night before he returned to his Privet Drive home , Harry arranged his luggage with a heavy heart . 
It is feared farewell party , the party often turned into a feast when the winner of the home league was announced . 
Since Harry had left his sickness , he had avoided the great hall of foyer , just waiting for the Great Hall to be empty , to avoid the gaze of the students . other . 
When Harry , Ron and Hermione walked into the hall , they immediately saw no decor , the hall was often decorated with the colors of the flags of the House won the league title . home to the farewell party . 
But tonight there was only black covering the wall behind the professor's dining table . 
Harry knew immediately that it was a Cerdic memorial expression . 
Brother Moody Eyes - crazy now sitting on the professor's desk , full of wooden legs and eyes . 
He is extremely upset , and he jumps up whenever someone talks to him . 
Harry could not blame him ; Moody's fear of being attacked has increased many times during the ten months of imprisonment in his own chest . 
Karkaroff's chair is empty . 
when the 
Harry was sitting with the other Gryffindor students , who wondered where Mr. Karkaroff was now , not knowing if Voldemort had caught him yet . 
Mrs. Maxime is still sitting there . 
She was with Hagrid . 
They talked to each other . 
Along the table at the far end was Snape sitting next to Professor McGonagall . 
His eyes glanced over Harry a glance as Harry looked up at him . 
His face is hard to guess . 
Facing him just as bitter as annoying as before . 
Harry continued to observe him long after Snape looked away . 
What did Snape do at Dumbledore's command the night Voldemort was resurrected ? 
And why Dumbledore is so rude that Snape's master is in the wrong with them ? 
Dumbledore said in his signature pot that Snape was their spy . 
Snape had scouted Voldemort with great personal danger . 
Do not know if he would accept that job , he knows he never really on the side with Dumbledore what ? 
As long as he pretends to be such , it's just a timeline , like Voldemort himself 
Harry's line of thought ends when Dumbledore stands up at the teacher's desk . The hall was quiet , though it was not as crowded as it was at the farewell parties . 
Dumbledore looked around at the students and said , 
End of school year . 
He paused , his eyes on the Hufflepuff table . 
This table was silently all the way up before Dumbledore stood up , and now there were only the most sad and pale faces in the Hall . 
Dumbledore said : 
I have many things to say to you tonight , but you must first acknowledge the loss of a very nice person , one who should have been here . 
He pointed to the Hufflepuff table , saying , 
He should have been enjoying this party with me . 
I want everyone to stand up , raise their glasses , and drink for Cerdic Diggory . 
Everyone follows Dumbledore's words ; The benches were crushed when everyone in the hall stood up , lifted the glass and echoed the chorus : Cerdic Diggory . 
Harry glanced at Cho in the crowd , tears streaming down her cheeks quietly . 
Harry looked down at the table as everyone sat down . 
Dumbledore continued to say : 
Cerdic is a man who exemplifies Hufflepuff's outstanding qualities , being a good and loyal friend , a diligent student who values ​​ justice . 
Cerdic's death affects all of us whether or not you know Cerdic . 
So you think you have the right to know exactly what happened . 
Harry raised his head and looked at Dumbledore . 
He said : 
Cedric Diggory was assassinated by Lord Voldemort . 
Panicked panic throughout the hall . 
Everyone looked at Dumbledore in horror and could not believe it . 
Dumbledore was completely calm as he watched the students murmur until they were quiet . 
He continued : 
The Magician did not want me to say this . 
Maybe some of your parents will be scared when I tell the truth . Or because they will not believe that Dark Lord Voldemort is back , or because they think they are too small , not to speak . tell the children . 
However , he believes the truth is generally better than lying , and any attempt to pretend that Cerdic's death is nothing but a fatal mistake , or a silly mistake . of Cerdic himself , hurts his memory of the game . 
Frightened and frightened , every face in the hall now looks toward Dumbledore . Harry sees Draco Malfoy whispering something to Crabbe and Goyle at the Slytherin table . 
Harry felt a hot temper in his stomach . 
He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore . 
He continued : 
Another person must also be mentioned in relation to Cerdic's death . 
Of course I'm talking about Harry Potter . 
There was a ripple in the hall and some headed toward Harry , then back toward Dumbledore . 
He still says : 
Harry Potter has managed to escape the Dark Lord Voldemort . 
He risked his life to bring Cerdic's body back to Hogwarts . 
In every way , Harry demonstrated the courage that few wizards have ever shown in the face of Dark Lord Voldemort , and so I promoted it . 
Dumbledore turned his gaze toward Harry and now his glass is up again . 
Nearly everyone in the Great Hall complied . 
They muttered the name , as they mumbled the name Cerdic , and drank it . 
But through the crevices of his fingers , Harry saw Malfoy , Crabbe , Goyle and many of the Slytherin students still stooped to sit at their table , not touching their glasses . 
Dumbledore , after all , had no eyeballs , so he did not see them . 
Once again , as everyone sat down , Dumbledore continued : 
The purpose of the Magic Trilogy is to co - develop and magnify the Magical knowledge . 
In the light of what has happened , and the return of Lord Voldemort , such ties are more important than ever . 
Dumbledore looked from Mrs. Maxime to Hagrid , from Fleur Delacour and the Beauxbatons to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrang students sitting at the Slytherin table . 
Harry saw Krum seemingly awake , almost panicked , as if he were waiting for Dumbledore to say something hard to hear . 
Dumbledore's gaze lingered on the Durmstrang students and said , 
All the guests in this great hall are welcome to come back here , any time if they want to return . 
Again I would like to say to all , with the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort , we unite to live , to die , to die . 
Lord Voldemort is very good at disseminating hatred and hostility . 
We can only fight him by demonstrating a strong friendship of equality and mutual trust . 
Difference in habit and language does not mean anything if our goal is the same and our heart is open . 
I believe we are facing a difficult and dark period - and I never expected that I would be mistaken . 
Some of you sitting in this Hall have suffered directly from the hands of the Dark Lord Voldemort . 
Many families have been scattered . 
A week ago , one of us was robbed . 
Remember Cerdic . 
Remember that when it comes time for you to choose between the right and the easy , remember what happened to a very good , very kind and courageous guy , just because he missed you . the road of Dark Lord Voldemort . 
Remember Cedric Diggory . 
Harry's chest was filled and closed ; Hedwig returned to the cage , placing it on the lid of the chest . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione were waiting in the Crowded Hall with other fourth - year students , waiting for the coaches to return to Hogsmeade . 
That day was another beautiful summer day . 
Harry watched as it came to Privet Drive in the afternoon , where he was so hot and shiny , the colorful carpet mess , the idea did not make him happy at all . 
Harry ! 
Harry looked back . 
Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps of the castle . 
Harry could see behind Fleur , across the school grounds , and Hagrid was helping Maxime win two huge horses without a carriage . 
The Beauxbatons are about to depart . 
As Fleur approached Harry , she raised her hand and said , 
I hope we will meet again . 
I am hoping to get a job in the UK , to improve my English . 
Said Ron with a slightly stammering voice : 
You're good at it . 
Fleur smiled at Ron ; Cried Hermione . 
Fleur turned and said : 
Goodbye listening to Harry , is a little more than just being acquainted with you ! 
Harry's spirit could not help but feel a little as he watched as Fleur hurried across the lawn to go back to Mrs. Maxime , her platinum hair glinting in the sunlight . 
Said Ron : 
Not sure how Durmstrang students can return . 
Guess they can steer the ship without Mr. Karkaroff ? 
A hoarse voice said , 
Mr. Karkaroff does not steer . 
He just stayed in the room and left us the train . 
It was Krum who broke up with Hermione . 
He told her : 
Can I talk to you ? 
Hermione looked a bit embarrassed , saying : 
Oh well . 
She follows Krum , through the crowd , out of sight . 
Ron called out to Hermione . 
You should fold up to hear . 
A minute later the car arrived . 
Ron , however , left Harry behind for a ride , and then , a few minutes later , reached up to stare at the crowd trying to see what Krum and Hermione might be doing . 
The two returned immediately , Ron stared at Hermione , but her face was very passive . 
Krum suddenly said to Harry : 
He loves Diggory . 
He was polite to him . 
Lun lun . 
Although he fell from Durmstrang's pupil Karkaroff's pupil . 
The last few hours Krum added with a grunt . 
Harry said : 
Do you have a new principal ? 
Krum shrugged , holding out his hand as Fleur did , shook Harry's hand , and shook Ron's hand . 
Ron seems to be suffering from a kind of painful inner struggle . 
Krum walked away and Ron blurted out : 
Please give me your signature . 
Hermione turned away and smiled at the wagonless horses with horrible horses running towards them in the pathway , while Krum , seemingly surprised , sensed the thrill of signing his name with a parchment for Ron . 
On the day they departed for King's Cross Station , the weather was a bit different from the day they departed for Hogwarts in September last year . 
There was not a small cloud in the sky . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione managed to get their own cabin on the train . 
The Pig was once again hiding in Ron's robes so that it would not bother him constantly , Hedwig was sleeping droopy , his head under the wings , Crookshanks crouching on a seat . The drum is like a large pillow feathers . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione chatted happily over the course of the week , while the railroad flew to the south . 
Harry felt as if , in some way , Dumbledore's speech at the farewell party had cleared it . 
Now speaking of the past it feels more painful . 
They just paused to talk about the action that Dumbledore could do at the moment to stop Voldemort from having the lunch cart pushed to the wagon . 
Hermione went out to buy some food and came back , leaving the money unattended , revealing a Prophetic newspaper she had brought . 
Harry looked at the newspaper , unsure if it really wanted to know what the newspaper might be posting , but Hermione caught sight of Harry , who calmly said , 
Newspapers do not post anything . 
You can read it , but you have not posted anything . 
I checked the newspaper every day . 
There was only a small tin on the day after the third test post that you won the competition . 
They did not even mention Cerdic . 
There is no line on that . 
In my opinion , Mr. Fudge must have made them silent . 
Harry said : 
Mr. Fudge would never take Rita to silence . 
Especially a story like that . 
Hermione said in a self - restrained voice that was strange : 
Oh , Rita has never written anything since the third exam . 
Actually , Rita will not be able to write anything in a while . 
She added , her voice a little shaky now : 
She will not write anything unless she wants to reveal her secret . 
Asked Ron : 
What are you talking about ? 
Said Hermione urgently : 
I discovered the way she overheard private conversations when she was not allowed to go to the school grounds anymore . 
Harry felt that for many days Hermione was dying to tell them , but she had managed to control herself before the terrible things that had happened to Harry . 
Harry said , 
What do you do ? 
Ron looked up at Hermione , asking : How did you find out ? 
Hermione said : 
Oh you actually suggested that to me , Harry . 
Harry looked puzzled : 
Hey ? 
How ? 
Hermione said happily : 
Stalking . 
But you said that is not effective 
Hermione said : 
Oh , not the electronic bugs . 
No , you do not understand Rita is a pet transformer without registration . 
You can turn into 
Hermione's voice trembled with joy of silence , and she pulled out of her purse in a closed glass jar , 
a bug 
Shouted Ron : 
Do you play ? 
You do not have her 
Hermione whispered to Ron and Harry , happily saying , 
Oh yes , she's the same . 
Inside the jar , there were some small branches , some leaves , and a large beetle . 
Ron brought the jar to his eyes , whispering : 
Which do you say you play ? 
Hermione brightened his face : 
No , I have no jokes . 
I caught her on the window of the sick room . 
You will see that the signs around her stalks are identical to the false eyelids she wears . 
Harry looked and saw that Hermione was right . 
It also remembers something : 
There was a beetle on the statue on the night we heard the story of Uncle Hagrid telling Maxime about his mother ! 
Hermione said : 
Exactly . 
And Viktor removed a bug on his hair when they were talking to each other on the lake . 
And if I was not mistaken , Rita was also on the curtain of the Prophet's classroom on the day of the painful scar . 
She was busy humming around the year . 
Ron said quietly : 
When we see Malfoy standing under the tree 
Hermione said : 
It was when she was talking to her Rita parked in her hands . 
Of course it knows . That's how she did all the little interviews with the Slytherins . 
They do not care what she's doing , as long as they provide her with terrible things about us and Uncle Hagrid . 
Hermione took the glass jar from Ron's hand and smiled at the bug . 
The beetle fluttering on the glass wall hummed angrily . 
Hermione said : 
I told her she would release her when we arrived in London . 
I've thrown a spell of Unbelievable Spell on the jar , some of you do not see it , so you can not transform it back . 
And I also told her that she should keep her pen for a year . To see her can break the habit of writing up the wrong story about people are not . 
With a smirk , Hermione puts the jar of beetroot back in her bag . 
The door of their room opened . 
Draco Malfoy said : 
You're very clever , Granger . 
Crabbe and Goyle are standing behind Malfoy . 
Harry has never seen the three of them being so cocky , aggressive and cruel to the present . 
Malfoy spoke slowly , stepping inside the chamber and slowly looking around , a scornful smile on his lips . 
So you've caught a good reporter , you are Dumbledore's old schoolgirl and Potter . 
Hit the big fight . 
Its laughter is wide . 
Crabbe , Goyle smiled hugging . 
Malfoy looked around at the three of them , saying , 
Let's not try to think about it . 
Try to pretend that it does not happen . 
Harry said : 
Get out . 
From the day Harry saw Malfoy moaning to Crabbe and Goyle while Dumbledore spoke about Cerdic , he never stood near Malfoy . 
He felt as if the bell was ringing in his ear . 
His hand gripped the wand under his robes . 
Malfoy raised his voice : 
You have chosen to stand on the losing side and Potter ! 
I warn you . 
You remember , I told you to choose friends carefully . 
When we met on the train on the first day to school Hogwarts it ? 
I told you not to have a dummy with that garbage . 
Malfoy nodded at Ron and Hermione , saying , 
Now it's too late Potter ! 
Now the Dark Lord is back , they will be the first to fall ! 
Mudblood and Muggle people will be destroyed first ! 
Next to Diggory is the map 
It was as if anyone had exploded a barrel inside the train's cabin . 
The blinding of the spell blossomed in every direction , a series of blasts deafening ears . 
Harry blinked to the floor . 
Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle fainted at the door of the prescription . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood up , each one of them had used a different charm . 
And not just three of them do it . 
Fred stomped on Goyle to enter the chamber and spoke in a calm voice . 
Tell them we will see the game that these three boys do not show . 
Fred held out his wand , and George , too , carefully kicked Malfoy one step further into the chambers . 
George looked down at Crabbe , saying : 
Interesting effect . 
Who has used Furnunculus ? 
Harry said : 
Em . 
George gently said , 
That's crazy . 
You use Giò Bòn . 
It seems these two things should not mix . 
It looks like the hair grows out of its face . 
Well , do not let them stay here summer ! 
Make the scene more beautiful ! 
Ron , Harry and George had just kicked and rolled three of the unconscious Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle into the pathway - each one looking worse than the obvious spell they had . 
Then Ron , Harry and George came back into the closet , pulling the door shut . 
Fred pulled out a cardboard box and announced , 
Does anyone play explosive ? 
They played halfway through the fifth game when Harry decided to ask . 
She told George : 
So you tell us ? 
Who are you black extortion ? 
George said with crassness : 
Oh that . 
Fred shook his head frustrated , saying : 
Nothing . 
Nothing important . Anyway , not now . 
George shrugged : 
we give up 
But Harry , Ron and Hermione kept asking , finally Fred said , 
Okay , okay , if we all want to know , it's Ludo Bagman . 
Harry asked immediately : 
Mr. Bagman ? 
Did he say he was involved ? 
George said , 
Are not . 
That's not it . idiot . 
He must have no mind . 
Asked Ron : 
Oh , what ? 
Fred hesitated and said , 
Do you remember the bet we did with him at the World Cup Quidditch match ? 
Ireland will win , but will Krum catch Snitch ? 
Harry and Ron slowly said , 
Have . 
Oh , he paid us back with the ghosts of the dwarf dwarfs he had picked up . 
So what ? 
Fred said impatiently : 
Anyway , gone ? 
The next morning , the gold that disappeared . 
Hermione said : 
But it is risky , is not it ? 
George laughed bitterly : 
Well , at first we thought so . 
We thought if we wrote to him , told him he had given the wrong money , he would probably repay it . 
But he did not do anything . 
Ignore our letters . 
We were trying to talk to him about the incident at Hogwarts , but he always had an excuse to avoid us . 
Fred said , 
Finally , he turned his face to his . 
We were too young to play gambling , and he did not pay us anything . 
George scowled , 
So we have to ask for our money . 
Hermione gasped . 
Do not refuse ? 
Fred said , 
Silly ! 
Counting ! 
Said Ron : 
But that's all for your savings ! 
George says : 
Try to tell me what to do . 
Of course , we finally know what happened . 
Lee's father is also troubled by Bagman's claim . 
It turned out he was in trouble with the goblins . 
He had borrowed a lot of money from them . 
The gang of goblins surrounded him in the woods after the World Cup and stripped away all the old gold , but not enough to pay off his debt . 
The elves followed him all the way to Hogwarts to watch over him . 
He lost everything . 
He no longer has two Galeon to swipe . 
And you know , how foolish old man tried to repay the goblins how ? 
Harry asked : 
How ? 
Fred said , 
He hit that fish , dear . Bet you will win the Magic Trial . 
Back fishing with goblins . 
Harry said : 
So that's why he's trying to help me win ! 
Ờ I finally won , right , so he can return the gold to you ! 
George shook his head . 
do not worry 
The goblins play like the old man . 
They said I was in the same class as Diggory , but Bagman was the one that won me over . 
Then Bagman must spring up . 
He just stuck up after the third test . 
George took a long breath and began to divide it . 
The last part of the journey looks just as comfortable ; Harry wished it all the way through the summer , in fact , he wished the train would never go to King's Cross Station . But as he had learned miserably throughout the school year with the lesson of time : Time will never slow down when something is unhappy to wait in front , and soon the Hogwarts Express stops at the nine - quarter station . 
All the chaos and noise were filled with corridors as the students began to get out of the train . 
Ron and Hermione carried their chests through Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
But Harry lingered . 
Fred , George is waiting for a moment . 
The twins turn around . 
Harry opened his chest and took out the Magic Trial bonus . 
He put money in hands George : 
I took it . 
Fred looked startled , exclaiming : 
What ? 
Harry repeated firmly : 
You take it . 
I do not want this money . 
George tried to push that money back to Harry . 
You are mentally ill . 
Harry said : 
No , I'm not crazy . 
You keep taking and make more inventions . This is the capital of the shop . 
Fred uttered in a nearly frightened voice : 
This guy is psycho 
Harry insisted : 
If you two do not take this money , I will throw it down the drain . 
I do not want it and I do not want it . 
But you can invest it in laughter . 
All of us can partner to create laughter . 
I have the feeling that we will soon need more laughter than ever . 
George considered the bag in his hand , saying weakly : 
Harry , there are probably thousands of Golden Galeon in here . 
Harry grinned : 
Ừ . 
Two you think think of how many it is how many cucumbers . 
The twin brothers glared at Harry . 
Just do not tell your cheeks where you got the money from , even if it may not be fun for you to work in the Ministry of Magic , but just think about it . 
Fred says , 
Harry 
But Harry pulled out his wand . 
It says clearly : 
Look , the two of you holding that money , otherwise you will charm him . 
Now I know a bunch of spells . 
Can you please give me one ? 
Buy some other suits and say your presents . 
Harry left the carriage before the brothers Fred and George could say a word . 
He walked past Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
The three of them still lay on the floor of the stiff room . 
Uncle Vernon was waiting for it behind the barricade , Mrs. Weasley standing next to him . 
When she saw Harry , she hugged him and whispered in his ear : 
I thought that Dumbledore would allow me to play with my family at the end of the summer . 
Keep in touch listening to Harry ! 
Ron patted Harry on the back , saying : 
See you again Harry ! 
Hermione said : 
Goodbye Harry ! 
And she did something she had never done before : kiss Harry on the cheek . 
George whispered while Fred stood beside him warmly nodding : 
Thank you Harry . 
Harry winked at them , turned back to Uncle Vernon and quietly stepped out of the station . 
She said to herself , there was nothing to worry about , as she climbed into the back seat of the Dursley family car . 
As Hagrid had said , what was to come would come and Harry would confront it when it happened .
