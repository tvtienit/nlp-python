harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 4 Horace Slughorn 
Despite the fact that in the past Harry had hoped for a moment of illusory hope that Dumbledore would come and pick him up , but now Harry felt more than ever his embarrassment . When both of you walk down the Privet Road . 
Ever since , it has never had a proper conversation with the Hogwarts school principal . 
There is always a gap between them . 
Memories of the most recent encounters appear , and it is increasingly rampant that Harry's mind becomes increasingly confused . 
He wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to tell so many other things , not the rejection of the inheritance property that Dumbledore mentioned . 
However , Dumbledore is probably as calm as nothing . Always be ready for your wand next to Harry . 
He said plainly . But I think you are not allowed to use magic outside of school , right ? " If there was an attack , " answered Dumbledore , " I allow you to use any magic or curse to fight back . 
But I do not think you should worry too much , nothing will happen tonight . Why not ? Because I have to go with you , Dumbledore replied calmly . 
" I ' ll take care of you , Harry , " he whispered , walking abruptly at the end of Privet Road , " I did not know , but I did not learn terribly , did I ? " Asked Harry suddenly . I do not think I'm 17 . "" I ' ll learn now , " answered Dumbledore . Then first thing you have to hold my hand tight . 
That left arm - if you do not mind I have seen it too - my chopsticks hand , at the moment it is quite weak . Harry followed his words correctly . Very well . Dumbledore said , Now let's go . Harry felt Dumbledore's arm twist around it and the twists grew and wrapped around it . the last thing it feels is that everything becomes dark ; It felt very strong from many different sides ; It can not breathe and feels as if there are squeezed steel bars around its chest , the eyes are almost pressed into the head , the eardrums are similar and then . 
Harry inhaled deeply into the cool air at night as his eyes opened . 
It feels like I'm just passing through a very cramped plastic tube . 
But just a few seconds later , he realized that he had no children at the same place , the Privet Road had disappeared . 
He and Dumbledore were in the middle of the square of a deserted village . 
Right in the middle of the square is a long - lived war memorial , surrounded by long - standing chairs . 
When Harry had calmed down , he realized he had just ventured into the first time in his life . Are you Harry ? Dumbledore asked with a worried look . How do you feel , strange ? I'm fine , Harry replied , rubbing his ear and answering reluctantly . But I still prefer to go with a broom . Dumbledore smiled , this way he said after fixing his cloak for neatness . 
Taking quick steps , he passed through an empty inn and houses no more than an inn . 
It was almost the night before the hour of a watch hanging on the church guard near . Tell me Harry , " asked Dumbledore , " is my scar all the more painful ? " Harry put his arm on his forehead , lightly touching the lightning scar , unconsciously . Asked about that , I thought it would 
It hurt the most when Voldemort regained his power . He glanced at Dumbledore and saw a satisfied expression on his face . I think otherwise , " said Dumbledore . Finally , Lord Voldemort realized in his heart the danger of reading his thoughts and feelings , which proved he was using Occlumency to prevent him . I do this . " I did not complain about this . " Said Harry , remembering that he had not missed any dreams or flashes in Voldemort's mind . 
They headed for the corner , through a telephone box and a bus stop . 
Harry looked up at Dumbledore again , " Professor . " " What is Harry ? " " Ehh - exactly where are we going ? " " Here , this is the magic village called Budleigh Babberton . " " And what are we doing here ? " " Well , I have not told you yet . " [ Missing one ] Slughorn looked at Dumbledore for a moment , then mumbled : I did not give them a chance . both . 
I have been moving for a whole year , not staying anywhere for more than a week . 
Moved from Muggle to Muggle . 
The owner of this house is on vacation in Canary Island . Very comfortable here , I will be very sorry to leave . It's simple , just a hard - wired spell on the silly anti - theft bells that they install and make sure the neighbors do not find out he's moving into the piano . 
Dumbledore said , but it sounded like a tedious existence of an old man who was exhausted to find a quiet life . 
Now , if you were at Hogwarts If you were going to tell me that our lives could be more peaceful at his uncomfortable school , he could save his life . 
Albus , we may be on the run , but some rumors have come to our ears since Dolores Umbridge left . 
If that was his treatment of teachers in this period , Professor Umbridge ran into the horn , Dumbledore said , I think he , Horace , knows the consequences of running into the forest and Calling a cod hereditary squid is what she did , Slughorn uttered . Stupid woman , unlike her usual Harry , laughed , and both Dumbledore and Slughorn turned to look at him . . Sorry Harry hastened to say it was just - I did not like her too Dumbledore stood up He was about to go Slughorn asked , looking hopeful No , I just wanted to use his bathroom Dumbledore said : Ồ Slughorn it , showing the disappointment Monday on the left in the hallway of Dumbledore striding out of the room . 
When his wing closed behind him , a silence enveloped him . 
A moment later , Slughoen stood up but did not seem sure what to do with himself . 
He looked at Harry one by one and turned toward the fireplace and turned his back on him , the warmth radiating from behind him , not thinking that he did not know why he raised him up suddenly . Harry looked at Slughorn . Simply , his silver eyes glide over Harry's scar , now focused on his face . He looks like his father . 
Yes , I've heard that Harry answered . Except for eyes , you have eyes . Like Harry's mother's eyes , Harry has been heard many times and he is tired . Hmn . 
Oh yes . 
Being a teacher should not be biased student , of course , but it is a student of mine . 
Your mother 
Added Slughorn , in response to Harry's questioning look . 
Lily Evans , one of the best students we ever had . 
Floating , active , you know . 
An attractive lady . 
I told him it should be in my house . 
But we have just received an outrageous answer . « What is your home ? » I am the Slytherin Slaughterman . 
« Oh , and now he continued hastily , observing the expression on Harry's face , waving his fat ring finger at Harry » not to argue with me . 
You are also a Gryffindor like your mother , right ? Yes , that is usually the family tradition . 
But not always . 
Have you ever heard about Sirius Black ? 
Certainly you have heard , appeared in the press during the past two years , died a few weeks ago . 
There seemed to be an invisible hand twisting Harry's intestines and holding it tight . 
Oh , anyway , it's a friend of three at school . 
All of Black's house was in my house , but Sirius stopped at Gryffindor's house . 
It's shameful - he's a smart boy . 
I got up his brother , Regulus when he went to school , but I liked Sirius more . 
Sughorn's voice as a charismatic collector is bidding higher in an auction . 
Apparently , he was staring at the opposite wall , aimlessly pointing at the spot to make sure the heat was behind him . 
Your mother is a muddy name - of course . 
I did not believe it . 
I thought your mother was pureblood , it was really good . 
One of his best friends is Muggle's son . 
And you are the best in the lock . 
It's funny why sometimes it happens again Slughorn nois Indeed , Harry said coldly . 
Slughorn looked at it with surprise . You should not think we're prejudiced . 
He said . 
No no no , . 
Did not you say that your mother is one of the hardest students in life ? 
And then there's Dirk Cresswell studying after your mother for a year , now the Goblin Information Manager and of course , a Muggle - born , excellent student and still providing insider information about the What is going on at Gringgotts Bank . 
He brags for a moment , then smiles selfishly and points to the sparkling picture frames of the dainty dressers , who are almost unmoving . 
All of our former students , all evidence . 
Do you see Barnabas Cuffe , editor of the Daily Prophecy ? 
It is always interested to hear our opinions about the daily news . 
And Ambrosius Flume , of Honeydukes , a casket for food every birthday , and the reason I introduced it to Ciceron Harkisss to begin his first job . 
And behind you , if you bend your neck , you ' ll see - it's Gwenog Jones , the captain of HolyHead Harpies . People are always surprised to hear I'm with the Harpies and have free tickets whenever I want . This seemed to make him extremely happy . And all these people know where to find him , and to send him that , Harry asked , not to wonder why the Deathly Hallows could not catch Mr. Slughorn when the food carts , Quidditch tickets , and the guests need to ask for advice and comments that still reach him . 
A smile flashed across Slughorn's face , very fast . Of course , he did not say and look at Harry who had not contacted him for a year . Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself , who lost his temper for a moment , then shrugged . Still , the wise witch must keep calm in these times . 
All must be alert to talk to Dumbledore , but getting a place at Hogwarts is now synonymous with publicly proclaiming our loyalty to the Order of the Phoenix . 
And while we are sure that they are very brave and admirable people and the rest , we do not like that high mortality rate ... 
He did not have to join the Order of the Phoenix to get up at Hogwarts . Harry screamed , not keeping up with the mockery of his voice : It was impossible to sympathize with Slughorn's wealthy life , which he remembered Sirius , lurking in . the cave and survive with rat meat . 
Most of the teachers were not in the same situation and none of them were killed , except for Quirrell , and that was because of his acceptance of what he had to do when working for Voldemort . Harry sure Slughorn was a good fit . He did not dare to hear Voldemort's name and it was not disappointing . 
Slughorn shivered and threw himself against it , but he ignored it . 
I suppose the teachers were the safest people out there when Dumbledore was the headmaster , the only one Voldemore was afraid of . 
Slughorn stared at the space for a moment . 
He seemed to be thinking about Harry's words . 
Well , the truth is that those who should not say names have never tried to fight Dumbledore , he grumbled reluctantly and one can argue that because he did not join the real Death Eater The one that should not be mentioned is hardly a friend of mine , and in this case , I might be safer when I'm closer to Dumbledore . 
I can not pretend that Amelia's death does not affect me . Especially with her , with all the communications and protection of the Ministry . 
Dumbledore returned to the room and Slughorn jumped up as if he had forgotten that Dumbledore was in the same house . 
Oh , he's here , Albus , he's been talking for so long , digestive disorder , no , just reading a Muggle magazine . Dumbledore says we love knitting patterns . 
Oh , Harry , we've had enough of Horace's hospitality . 
I think it's time to go . 
Without hesitation , Harry stood up , Slughorn's bow tightened . You guys , yes , in fact , I think we know a failed prince because we see a Fifth person ? 
Slughorn seems to be agitated . 
He wiggled his fat fingers and was nervous about seeing Dumbledore tighten his travel shroud and Harry pulled on his jacket . 
Oh , I'm sorry you did not want that job , . 
Horace Dumbledore said , lifting his injured arm up to say goodbye . 
Hogwarts will be pleased to welcome you back . 
No matter how much we enhance security , he is always welcome to visit , as he wants . 
YesỜ very pleased , as I said . 
Goodbye Goodbye , Harry says Two people are coming out the front door , a shouting behind : Okay , all right , I ' ll make Dumbledore turn around to see Slughorn standing steady at the living room door He ' ll come back Yeah Yes , Slughorn says , can not hold the patience , I'm crazy , but I'm gonna make the Dumbledore smile Horace , We ' ll meet again on September 1 . 
Slughorn muttered . As he came out of the garden , Slughorn's voice was still behind them . I wanted a raise , Dumbledore . Dumbledore chuckled . 
The garden door swayed and closed behind the two teachers , they began to descend the hill , through the dark and the dew . Very well done , Harry Dumbledore complimented . 
I did not do anything . Harry uttered astonishment . 
Oh , no , I did . 
I showed Horace exactly what he was going to get back to Hogwarts . 
Do you like him ? " Er ... " He was not sure if he liked Slughorn or not . 
He thought he seemed comfortable in his way , but also seemed illusory and , contrary to all he said , he was surprised to find that a Muggle child was a good witch . Horace Dumbledore says , helping Harry to say anything , just like his life . 
He likes to stay with celebrities , be successful and have power . 
He enjoyed the feeling he could influence these people . 
He never wanted to sit on his own . 
He likes to stand behind his back - there are more spaces to show , you can see . 
He carefully chooses the hard - hitting students at Hogwarts , some of them have ambition or mind , sometimes for charisma and intelligence . 
He has a mysterious facade that is able to pick the right people who will become leaders in their field . 
Horace established a kind of club for his beloved students , with whom he was centered , made recommendations , built up useful relationships among members , and always Harvesting some benefits in return . It could be a box of pineapple free of charge that he likes or the opportunity to introduce the next senior member of the Goblin information department . Harry suddenly had a vivid image of a large spider , carving a net around it , firing silk threads everywhere to pull the colorful flies near . I told you all this was not for me to turn my back on Horacwe , well , now we have to call him Slughorn , but let me be safe , Dumbledore said , No doubt he will try . take over , Harry . 
I will be the decoration for his collection : Baby - still - life ... or , as they called me recently : Selected person When listening to these words , a feeling of great Cold had nothing to do with the fog that surrounded Harry . 
It reminded me of the words that it had heard a few weeks ago , words that have a special and terrible meaning for it : no one can live when the other is dead . Dumbledore stops , par excellence they have gone through . 
We will start , Harry , take my hand . 
Harry is ready for Apparition ( apparently buried or forgotten ) but still feels uncomfortable . 
As the pressure disappeared and he felt it was possible to breathe again , he realized he was standing on a side street . 
Dumbledore and is looking at the twisted silhouette of its second favorite home in the world : The Shack . 
Despite the sense of dread and fleeting glance in it , its spirit does nothing except lift that burden . 
Ron was in there , and the Weasley boys , who cook better than all the people Harry knew . If you do not mind , Dumbledore said as they walked through the gate , I have a few words to tell you before we break up . 
Own story , perhaps here ? To To 
Dumbledore pointed to a stone sub - house where the Weasleys housed their broomsticks . 
A moment of confusion , Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space not more than a central wardrobe . 
Dumbledore lit the wand head , it burned like a torch and smiled back at Harry . 
I hope you will give it to me because I mentioned it , Harry , but I am very comfortable and have a bit of pride in the way you have dealt with everything that has happened in the Ministry of Magic . 
Let me say this , I think Sirius is very proud of me . 
Harry snapped , his voice seeming to abandon it . 
It does not think it can withstand the exchange of Sirius . 
It was painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say his godfather was dead and even worse when he heard Sirius's name emitted accidentally through Slughorn . It was a cruel thing to do when Sirius and I had so little time together . Says Dumbledore , " A cruel ending to what should be a long and happy relationship . 
Harry nodded , his eyes focused on a spider crawling on Dumbledore's hat . 
It can be said that Dumbledore understood , that he even suspected that until his letter arrived , Harry had spent most of his time in the Dursleys , lying in bed , staring and staring at The dewy window , filled with the cold and empty feeling that it had experienced in the face of the mistress . It was hard to accept that he would not write to me anymore , Harry finally said , in a very slight voice . 
His eyes suddenly glowed and it had to close . 
He felt embarrassed about accepting it , but the fact that it was someone outside of Hogwarts was concerned with what happened to him , like a father . 
Finding a foster father is one of the best things about it and now the delivery owl will never give it that comfort again . Sirius means so much to me that I have never known before . 
Dumbledore said , Naturally , this loss was a disaster . But when you were at the Dursleys » Harry interrupted , his voice began to grow stronger . I realized that I could not fall or collapse . 
Sirius would not want that , is not it ? And anyway , life is too short . 
Look at Mrs. Bones , Emmeline Vance You may be the next , do not you ? 
But if that's what it says furiously , look at Dumbledore's blue eyes that are lit up in the light of the magic wand : how many deaths will you carry with me ? Voldemort , if you can do it . Deserve to be the son of three children and adoptive child Sirius Dumbledore said , with a pat on the back Harry agreed . 
I will take my hat off , or I will , if I'm not afraid of just for the spider And now , Harry , a related issue closer , I have seen you have read the Prophet's Weekly 2 weeks Yes , Harry replied , his heart began to beat faster . 
And you will find that many things have been revealed that are related to your trip 
to the Prophet's Office . 
Yes , Harry answered ; And now people know that you are one . No , they did not know that Dumbledore interrupted only two people in the world who knew the full content of the prophecy concerning the son and Lord Voldemort , and both of them were standing in the dirty broomstick and full of spiders . It is true , however , that many people have speculated , precisely , that Voldemort had sent Death Eaters to steal prophecy , and that this prophecy was related to him . 
And I think I was right to say that I did not tell anyone that I knew what the prophecy said . 
Did not Harry make a wise decision ? Dumbledore said , though I think you ' ll be comfortable with Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger's friends . Yes , when Harry looked startled , I thought they should know , I would disappoint them by not sharing some important things with them . 
I do not want to .... 
Do they worry or fear ? To To Dumbledore said , watching Harry through his moon glasses . Or did he confess that he himself was worried and scared ? 
I need friends , Harry . 
And I was right , Sirius would not want me to live without Harry , but Dumbledore did not seem to ask for an answer . 
" Another thing , also relevant , I want you to learn my own lessons with me this year . 
Separate - to Harry said , the surprise instead of the previously quiet silence . Yes , I think it's time for me to get more involved in your child's education . Oh , this one , little one , Dumbledore said happily . But Dumbledore did not reveal anything else , and he asked for one more thing that had annoyed him before . 
If you study with me , you will not have to learn Occlumency lessons with Snape , Snape , Harry , and no , you will not be great , Harry said , sighing , because they are ... ... . . 
It stopped , careful not to say what it really meant . I thought the word failure here was united , Dumbledore said , nodding at Harry , laughing , that means I will not see much of Snape from next . Is not that right , Harry said because he did not allow me to attend private classes unless he achieved excellent grades in mathematics , which he did not achieve . Do not count the owls before they come to Dumbledore say solemnly . I'm thinking of what should happen at the end of the day . 
Now , harry , two things , before we break up . The first thing I want you to do is keep the Invisibility T - shirt next to you from now on . 
Even in Hogwarts . 
Just in case , I understand that Uncle Harrt nodded . And finally , while you were here , the best security shelter the Department of Magic can do . 
These measures have caused a lot of trouble for Arthur and Molly - for example , all their correspondence will be checked at the Ministry before sending them , they are not afraid of anything , all they care about is the Your child's safety . 
Anyway , it would be unreasonable if you risked your life when you were with them . I knew Harry was quick . Very well , Dumbledore said , opening the broom and stepping out . " I saw the fire in the kitchen . 
We should not be deprived any longer of the opportunity of skinny baby " 
Chapter Five , Phlegm 
Harry and Dubledore standing in front of a familiar back door filled with rubber boots and rusty cauldrons of the Burrow Farm , Harry could hear the small clatter of sleepers in the barn . Dumbledore knocked three times on the door , Harry saw the other side of the kitchen window . " Someone ? " Said a strained voice that Harry knew was Mrs. Weasley . " Please declare it ! " " It's me , Dumbledore , with Harry . " The wing opened immediately , Mrs. Weasley standing there , her low body , round in her green old shirt . " Oh , Harry , honey ! 
Dumledore , you startled me , he said he would not come before dawn . "" We were lucky , " he said with Harry . " Slughorn was more convincing than I thought , of course Harry's . 
Ah , Numphadora ! " Harry looked around and found out it was late but Mrs. Weasley was not alone . 
A wicked heart - shaped witch with brown curly hair sitting next to the table and holding a large lug . " Hello professor , " she said . " How are you , Harry ? " " Tonks , " Harry found Miss Tonks appearing somber , even a little sick , and there seemed to be something reluctant in her smile . Apparently her appearance was lacking in color . An unusual way when there is no ordinary pink hair . " I think I should go , " Tonks said , standing up and starting to wear her jacket . " Thank you for the cup of tea and understanding , Molly . " " Please do not go for me , " Dubledore said in a piteous manner . " I'm not going to stay , I have a desk with Rufus Scrimgeous . " " No , no , I have to go work , " Tonks said , trying not to look at Dumbledore's eyes . " Goodbye " " Baby , why do not you come in for dinner this weekend ? 
There are both Remus and Mad Eye . " No , Miss Molly , anyway , thanks , Sam . " Tonks hurried over to Harry and Dumbledore went out into the garden and a few more steps left the gate to disappear into the air . 
Mrs. Weasley looked nervous . " You think your teacher will meet again at Hogwarts , Harry , " said Dumbledore . " Goodbye , Miss Molly . " He bowed to Mrs Weasley and disappeared like Tonks was . Weasley closed the door behind the empty garden and led Harry in the kitchen to sit down and look at Harry for a moment . . 
" You are like Ron , " she sighed , looking from head to toe . " Looks like both of you were skully , so I'm sure Ron was at least four inches taller since last time I bought him a robe . Are you hungry ? " Yes , yes , " said Harry . and suddenly realized that he was very hungry . " Sit down , darling , let him warm up something . " As soon as Harry sat down , a feathered cat with a flat face climbed up Harry's lap and lay there , moaning . " So is Hermione here ? " he asked cheerfully and began to scratch Crooksanks ' ear . " That's right , she came in the other day , " said Mrs. Weasley , waving her pot with a wand , " Well , of course I'm sleeping , no one thought you were coming this time . Let's eat . " Mrs. Weasley knocked the pot once and it flew . came to Harry's place and started pouring out , Mrs. Weasley took a bowl to help just in time a soup was poured out . " You eat bread ? " Yes , sir , " said Mrs. Weasley with a wand , a loaf of bread with a knife that flew gracefully and grasped onto the table and began to cut itself into slices . The cook , Mrs. Weasley , sat down opposite Harry . " So you convinced Horace Slughorn to take the job ? " Harry nodded , mouthing his head so he could not speak . " He had taught him and his uncle Arthur . He had been teaching at Hogwarts for a long time , the same time as Dumbledore , I think so , I like him . are you " Harry shrugged and tilted his head to give an uncertain answer . " I understand you , " Mrs. Weasley nodded politely . " It's obvious he can be respectable when he wants to , but Arthur never liked him . 
There was a horde of Horace's favorite students at the Ministry of Magic , who was very good at collecting disciples , but he did not spend much time with Arthur . This proves Slughorn can also make mistakes ! 
You do not know if Ron has told you this in a letter yet because it's new , Arhur has been promoted . It's clear that Mrs. Weasley has just been waiting to talk . 
Harry quickly swallowed a hot soup and saw his neck burn . " That's great , " he gasped . " Oh , that's so cute , " Mrs. Weasley beamed , her eyes watery ( because of her hot soup ) , reacting to the good news . " Rufus Scrimgeour has just opened a few new sets to respond to the situation now , Arthur is the Minister for Detecting and Retaining Conspiracy Protectors and Corpses , a very good job , There are now ten assistants . "" So the Ministry is ... ? "" Well , as you know , when the fear spreads everywhere , there will be some weird stuff collected and brought back . For sale , items that the buyer thinks may be against the Death Eaters or Who - Know - Who . What is like a poison vial is actually only a jar of water added a bit of pus or a guide to make a mantra fight but actually broke his ears ... In general , things are only by the croaking slightly like Mundungus m , the kind of people whose whole life has never been a day of honest living and enjoy taking advantage of the anxiety of others to make a living , so today , tomorrow , there is always something . You know , one time Arthur received a box of custody that was definitely sent from a Death Eater . 
Seeing that , it was an important job , he told Arthur that it was a shame if he regretted dealing with such muddy plugs and junk . " Mrs. Weasley finished her speech with an insane look as if Harry had just suggested that the sockets were normal . " Uncle Arthur was still in the office ? " Harry asked . " Oh , and it was a bit late , he told you to be at home around midnight . " Mrs. Weasley glanced at the clock that was sloppyly placed on the bottom of the table at the bottom of the table . 
Harry recognizes it right now , it has 9 needles , each carved with the name of a family member and is usually hung on the walls of the Weasley Hall . However , the current location of the watch demonstrates It was taken by Mrs. Weasley all day today , all 9 needles pointing to the DEATH HAZARD . " It's been such a long time ... " Mrs. Weasley said in a voice that was trying to be normal but not convincing at all . " ... since the One - who - well - know - is - backed up , I think everyone is in danger , not just the house . But I do not know . Who has the watch like that , so I can not test it . Oh ! " Mrs. Weasley pointed to the clock , the needle named Arthur pointed to the DISTRIBUTE box . And just then , there was a knock at the back door . Weasley got up and ran to the door , one hand holding the doorknob , " Arthur , are you right ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Weasley , tired tone . " But you can say you're a Death Eater too , honey . Ask the question ! " " Molly ! " " All right , all right , what is your biggest ambition ? " " I understand why the plane can operate . " Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob . , but it is clear that Mr. Weasley is holding the other fist because the door is still closed . " Molly , I have to ask you a question . " " Oh , that's just stupid , Arthur . " " What do you usually want me to call you when we're alone ? " Frosty Harry can also ensure that Mrs Weasley's face is flushed , and her ears and throat feel warmer . " Mollywobbles , " Mrs. Weasley whispered to the door . " Exactly , I can open the door for you now ! " Mrs. Weasley opened the door , Mr. Weasley stepped in . Mr. Weasley , a thin , tall , bald witch with extremely weasely red hair , wore horns and sunglasses . wearing a dusty coat . " I do not know how to go through the procedure when you go to Arthur's house , " said Mrs. Weasley , face still blushed to help Mr. Weasley remove the evil . " I mean , the Death Eaters can also force us to say the answer easily before they pretend to be us . " " You know me , but it's the procedure of the Ministry of Magic and You have to be an example . 
Hey , what's that smell like , like soup onion right ? " Mr. Weasley was full of hope to look at the table . 
" Ah , Harry , I do not think I ' ll see you soon . " The two shook hands and Mr. Weasley plopped down the chair beside Harry . Mrs. Weasley had placed a bowl of soup on Mr. Weasley's table . " Thank you Molly . It's a tiring night . Some silly fools get up selling FASHIONING HANDS , just put on your neck that can turn into any shape you want , custom type , all only ten Galleons . " 
" So what's really going on when people wear it ? " " Most of the time , people turn to a light orange , but there are cases of warts . " It sounds like something Fre and George would find interesting . " Mrs. Weasley hesitated . " Are you sure it's not ... " " I'm sure . They will not do the same thing at this time , when they need protection . "" Why are you late for the shootings ? "" No , I had a slow fire at Elephant and Castle , but luckily the Magical Law Team successfully dealt with it before we got there . 
Harry was trying to cover a huge yawn behind his hand . " Harry , go to sleep , " he said , " you've got Fred and George's room for me , and you ' ll be sleeping alone there . " " Why ? Where are they ? " We are at Xo Xeo , sleeping in a small house that we rent because we are too busy with work , " Mrs. Weasley said . " At first I did not agree , but they also seemed to be talented in business , just go away , my chest was up there . " " Sleep well , Mr. Weasley . " Harry pushed his chair up , Crookshanks . Leaning away from Harry's thighs , he leaps out of the room . " Sleep well Harry , " said Weasley . 
Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glancing at the washcloth clock , all the hands pointing to the DEATH HAZARD . 
Fred and George's room on the second floor , Mrs. Weasley , knocked the chopstick into the chandelier on the bedside table , and the room was brightly lit with a bright yellow color . Even though there was a vase on the bedside cabinet , The smell of flowers was not enough to overwhelm the smell of something that Harry suspected was gunpowder . A large part of the room was filled with cardboard boxes The file was a chest of Harry . It looked like the room had been used as a temporary store of the family . 
Hegwid glided over from the top of the garment , delighted to see Harry , and then sped away to the darkness , knowing that the bird was waiting to see it before heading for the bait . 
Harry said goodbye to Mrs. Weasley , wore a nightgown and climbed into bed . There was something hard in Harry's pillow , and he reached out and pulled out an orange , orange - colored glue that was not mistaken , it was KISS , he smiles , curls up and falls asleep . 
Harry woke up as the gun exploded as the door burst open , the key was opened , the man pulling the curtain , the glowing light streaming into his eyes , one eye covering his eyes trying to find his eye glasses . 
" What ? " " We did not know you were here , " a loud and excited voice said , and Harry was beaten on the head by a painful pillow . " Ron , do not beat Harry , " another accused voice . 
Harry found his glasses and put on them despite the glare that made him see nothing . A big shadow flashed in Harry's face , a few seconds later he saw that it was Ron Weasley who was getting married . with it . " Fine ? " " Never better , " Harry answered , clawing his head and leaning against the pillow . " What about you ? " " Okay , " Ron said as he pulled a cardboard box to sit . " When did you come ? 
She just told us . " 
" About 1 o ' clock this morning . " " What about the Muggles ? They treat you well ? " " As usual , " Harry replied as Hermione was looking for a seat at the bottom of the bed . " They do not talk much to me , I like that more . Why then Hermione ? " " I'm fine . " She answered and looked at Harry as though she was sick . By this , and it is completely unlikely to discuss Sirius ' death or any grief , he said , " What time did I miss my breakfast ? " I will bring you breakfast , I think you are slightly short of food . " Ron's eyes watched Harry , " So what happened ? " What's wrong , I'm stuck with my aunt . "" Stop it , " said Ron , " You went somewhere with Dumbledore . "" It's not fun , I just wanted to convince a teacher to go back to teaching , his name is Horace Slughorn . " " Oh really . " Ron was disappointed . " So we thought ... " Hermione gave Ron a warning and it changed the tone at an incredible rate . " ... thought of something like that . . " " Really ? " Harry was surprised . 
" Um ... um ... Umbridge has already gone , obviously we need a black martial arts teacher right ? 
What is he like ? "" He looks like a hummingbird , he used to be the Slytherin master . " Said Harry , " what's wrong Hermione ? " She looked at Harry as if waiting for a strange symptom that could appear any time , as Harry asked , Hermione changing her expression with an unconvincing smile . " Oh , no . What , oh ... so Slughorn is a good teacher ? "" Do not know , he's no worse than Umbridge anyway ? "" I know you are worse than Umbridge . " A voice trailed off the door , Ron's sister Ginny was entering the room with irritation . " Hello Harry ! " What was wrong with you ? " Asked Ron . " That woman . " Ginny said , throwing herself over Harry's bed . " She made me mad . " What did she do ? " Hermione asked in a sympathetic tone . " The way she talked to me ... I thought I was about the third . "" I understand . " Hermione lowered her voice . " She's always so self - righteous . " Harry was so surprised to hear Hermione say so about Mrs. Weasley and did not blame Ron when Ron shouted , " You two can not forgive her for a bit ? " Oh yes , protect her . " Ginny replied , " We know you're always in love with her . " Feeling these words oddly talking about Mrs. Weasley , knowing that she was not lacking in information , Harry asked , " Who is that person ? " The answer came just before Harry was in time . At the end of the question , the door of the room opens again , so quick that Harry unleashes the blanket up to the chin as Ginny and Hermione fall to the ground . 
A young girl is standing at the entrance of the room , a young girl with a fascinating beauty makes the room almost no air at all . 
She is tall , luscious with long blonde hair , appearing as a dazzling overwhelm , in order to complete her perfect image , in her hand is a heavy food tray . " Arry ! " She said in a nasal voice . " You're too busy ! " 
As the girl ran up to Harry , Mrs. Weasley appeared in the back , looking irritable . " No need to carry the tray , I can do it myself . " " Kiss the star , " said Fleur Dalacour , placing the tray on Harry's chest and leaning down to kiss his cheeks . Fleur's lips were burning . " Sister mourning to meet you , you still remember your girl , Gabrielle ? 
He talked smartly about Arry Potter in the summer shoot , it would be fun to see him again . " Oh ... she's here too ? " Harry blurted out . " No , no , silly boy . " Fleur laughed at you , " I mean , next summer , when are you ... do not you ? " Fleur's blue eyes widened and looked at Mrs. Weasley with a scolding , " she said , " Well , we have not had time to say it . " Fleur turned to Harry , plucking the platinum blonde's hair to make it whip into Mrs. Weasley's face . " Bill and I are going to make a mess . "" Oh , " said Harry , and it was empty , it was impossible not to notice that Mrs. Weasley , Hermione , and Ginny were trying to avoid each other's glare . " Wow , they're glad . " Fleur bent down again and kissed Harry again . " Bill was very busy , he worked very hard , and she was working as a salesman at Gringotts Bank . You understand my family and I'm glad to hear that you will come here . "" I'm going to be busy doing the cooking and the chick , " Arry said . " With such words , she turned gracefully as if gliding out of the room , closing the door lightly behind her . 
Mrs. Weasley made a sound that sounded like " Oh ! " " I hate her , " Ginny whispered . Weasley responded with an uncomfortable whisper . " I did not hate her , I just thought they were too hasty . That's all ! "" They've known each other for years , " said Ron , looking groggy and staring at the door . " It was not a long time , of course , of course , because of the uncertainty about Ai's come - know - it - all , everyone was hurrying to decide . They used to think that they would die tomorrow . Just like before , when they were strong , the children from east and north - west were all running away from home . " and dad ? " Well , mom and dad gave birth to each other , there's no reason to wait . " Mrs. Weasley said , " While Fleur and Bill , how much do they have in common ? 
Bill is very active , in fact , while Fleur is ... "" A cow , " Ginny said , nodding a snatch . " But Bill is not very realistic either , he's the Dumbledore . No , he's adventurous , and a little glamorous ... I think that's why he likes Phlegm . "" Do not call her Ginny , " Mrs. Weasley yelled at Harry . and Hermione was laughing . " Well , let's continue with our work ... Harry , eat the egg when it's hot . " Apparently worried , Mrs. Weasley went downstairs , while Ron looked still wobbly , shaking his head like a dog rushing from his ear . " You're not used to it yet . Her presence in the same house ? " Harry asked . " You sure are . " Said Ron , " she just came out so suddenly . " 
" Uh - huh , touching , " Hermione said irritably and walked as far away from Ron as possible , her arms folded as she approached the wall .

Chapter 6 : Draco's Roadmap 
Harry stayed in the narrow farmhouse for several weeks thereafter . 
He spends most of his time playing Quidditch team - mates in the Weasley's orange garden ( it's Hermione playing Ron and Ginny , Hermione playing bad and Ginny playing well , so they're good ) and In the evening , we ate three servings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of us . It would have been a happy and peaceful holiday if there were no missing , strange accidents , even deaths , which appeared almost daily in the Prophet . 
Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home unpublished news . 
In Mrs. Weasley's anger , Harry's 16 th birthday party was ruined by the horrible news brought by Remus Lupine , who now looks very dour and fierce , his brown hair There are tangled gray hairs , clothes are ragged and patchwork than ever . There were some more Fraternal Assaults , he said , as Mrs. Weasley handed him a big birthday cake . And Igor Karkaroff's body was found in a tent on the north . 
The Dark Mark was found on the body - well , to tell the truth , I was surprised to see him live for a year after escaping the Death Eaters ; Sirius's brother , Regulus , lasted only a few days as my memory . That's right , well , Mrs. Weasley frowned , maybe we should talk about something pretty . Did you hear anything about Florean Fortescue not remus ? Bill asked , while Fleur was constantly adding wine to the cup . The man in charge of the ice cream shop in Alley ? Harry interrupted , with an uncomfortable feeling , hollow in his heart . He usually gives his son ice cream to pay for free . 
What happened ? Leveled , according to the style of his shop . Why ? Asked Ron , Mrs. Weasley looking straight at Bill , angry . Who know ? 
He can make them angry in some way . 
He is a good man , Florean . Speaking of Lane , Mr. Weasley said , it seems that Ollivander is also traveling . Witcher Ginny jumped . That's him . 
Empty stores . 
There was no sign of a fight . 
No one knows he volunteered or was abducted . But what wand do people do now ? There are other makers , too , Lupine said . But Ollivander was the best , and if the other had him , it was not good . The day after this gloomy tea ceremony , three letters and a list of textbooks were sent from Hogwarts . 
Harry was sent a surprise , and was appointed captain of Quidditch . This makes you have the same role as the leader ! Said Hermione cheerfully . You can use our bathroom together with other things ! 
Wow , I remember the day Charlie was wearing one of these , Ron studied the badge happily . Harry , great guy , you're my captain , I think only if you let me stay in the team , ha ha Hey , I do not think we can delay our trip to Alley again one more time You have received these things , Mrs. Weasley sighed , looking at Ron's book list . We will go on Saturday if the father does not have to work . 
I will not go there without him . This mother , honestly , do you think that anyone - who - knows - who - will hide in a bookshelf at Flourish and Blotts ? Ron chuckled . Fortescue and Ollivander have gone on vacation right ? Mrs. Weasley was angry . If you think security is a laughable issue then you can stay and mom will take things for yourself . No , I want to go , I want to see the rest of you Fred and George ! Said Ron hurriedly . Then you have to reconsider your mind , before you decide that you are too young to be with you ! Mrs. Weasley said angrily , grabbing her watch , with nine needles at the same risk of death , and adjusting it to the weight of a freshly washed towel . And the return to Hogwarts is also considered that way ! Ron turned to look at Harry anxiously as his mother picked up the laundry basket with the clutter in her hand and left the room . Oh , I can not even joke here anymore . But in the end , Ron was avoiding Voldemort a few days later . 
Saturday came without any more of Mrs. Weasley's rage , though she seemed very tense at breakfast . 
Bill would have to stay at home with Fleur ( much to Hermione and Ginny's will ) , and he turned a bag full of money over to Harry . Where's mine ? Ron demanded immediately , eyes wide . That's Harry , idiot , Bill said . I took the money out of the safe for you , Harry , because now it takes outsiders 5 hours to get gold , the goblins have increased protection very strict . 
Two days before Arkia Philpott was the real Detective in the E - mail , believe him , this way is much easier . Thank you Bill , Harry said , stuffing the gold in his pocket . Eat always deep , Fleur whisper affectionately , pinching Bill's nose . 
Ginny made a nauseous gesture at his cereal bowl behind Fleur , making Harry laugh , choking on corn tortillas , and punching Ron in the back . It was a dark and damp day . 
One of the special units of the Ministry of Magic that Harry had been sitting once was waiting for everyone in the yard before they left the house , screaming in their robes . Actually , he got the car again , Ron said , stretching his shoulder as the car moved slowly out of the farm , Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window . 
Harry , Hermione , and Ginny were sitting comfortably in the back seat . Do not expect too much , all because of Harry , Mr. Weasley said behind his shoulder . 
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were sitting in front of the Ministry's driver , where the front passenger seat was pulled into a couch for two . 
It must be protected to the maximum . 
And we will also be protected at Quan Vat . Harry did not say anything ; He was not very happy with the procurement work in the encirclement of a battalion . 
He stuffed the Invisibility Cloak into his shoulder bag and thought that if it was good for Dumbledore , it would be good for the Department as well , although he was thinking about it now , it is unlikely he would . know about it . 
Here , the driver said after a very short time , he first spoke as he drove slowly across Charing Cross Road and stopped outside Quan Vac Dau . I will wait for people , how long will people stay there ? A few hours , I think , Mr. Weasley said . Ah well , he's here ! Harry followed Mr. Weasley and peered out the window , his heart pounding . 
There was no morninglight waiting outside the inn , instead a large Rubeus Hagrid with a thick beard , Hogwarts forest watchman dressed in a long beige leather jacket , radiant when he saw Harry , despite The frightening looks of Muggles passing . Harry ! He screamed , pulling Harry into a hug to fracture as Harry got out of the car . 
Buckbeak - I mean Witherwings - I have to meet him Harry , it's fun to be back in the sky . I'm glad it's okay , Harry laughs as he rubs his ribs . I do not think ' protect ' is again . I know , like the old days are not it ? 
See , the Department wants to send out some of the gods , but Mr. Dumbledore says we ' ll go , Hagrid prides himself , puffs his chest up and puts two thumbs in his pockets . Let's go , the two of us go first , Molly , Arthur Quan Vac Craig , for the first time in Harry's memory , completely empty . 
Only true landlord Tom , wrinkled skin and teeth are all lost , is still in the old people . 
He looked up hopeful as they entered , but before he could speak , Hagrid said , " Just today , Tom , you must understand , Hogwarts work , you You know that . Tom nodded mournfully and continued scanning the shattered glass ; Harry , Hermione , Hagrid , and the Weasleys went through the bar outside and to the chilly courtyard in the back where the trash containers were . 
Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and taped a brick on the wall , which immediately opened a porch leading to a winding cobbled street . 
They entered the gate and stopped , looking around . 
Alley has changed . 
The glowing and sparkling door , the display of magazines , drug paraphernalia , and cauldrons , was hidden behind the huge posters of the Ministry of Magic . 
Most of these bleak , purple posters carry content about the inflated versions of the ministry's security guides that were sent out in the summer , and some black and white photos of Death Eaters have not been arrested . 
Bellatrix Lestrange is laughing at the front in a recent photograph . 
Some of the windows were filled , which was the Florean Fortescue Ice Cream Shop . 
In addition , a few dingy stalls have sprung up along the street . 
The nearest is erected outside of the Flourish and Blotts Store , underneath a dirty stained - glass porch , and has a panel attached to the front : CHRISTMAS WORKS Against the werewolf , < - - Danger from outside , and - from inside ! > A sly little wizard wiggled with silver emblems attached to the chains on the passersby . One for the girl , ma ' am ? He called on Mrs. Weasley as they passed , glancing at Ginny . Protect your pretty neck ? If we were working , Mr. Weasley looked at the spell seller , glaring furiously . That's right , but do not arrest anyone now . We're in a hurry , Ms . Weasley anxiously raised a long list . I think we should go to the first Malkin's Shop , Hermione needs a new cloak , and Ron's shirt is too short for the knee , I need a little too Harry , I grew up a lot - go everyone - 
Molly , there's no reason why we all go to Mrs. Malkin , Mr. Weasley said . Why did not the three of us go with Hagrid , and we went to Florish and Blotts to buy books for them ? I do not know , Mrs. Weasley worried , obviously wondering between buying fast and going together into a union . Hagrid , do you think do not worry , kids will be safe with me Molly , Hargid said softly , waving his big hand like his lid . 
Mrs. Weasley does not seem completely convinced , but eventually agrees to split in half , running hastily toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny , while Harry , Ron , Hermione , and Hagrid to Mrs. Malkin's shop . 
Harry noticed that a lot of people had feelings of anxiety like Mrs. Weasley , and no one stopped talking ; The shoppers are tied together very closely in their group , doing their job intently . 
No one seems to go shopping alone . 
It would be very cramped if we came in together , Hagrid said , stopping outside the shop of Mrs Malkin and bending down to glance through the window . I will stand outside , okay ? So Harry , Ron , and Hermione went to the store together . 
In the first impression , it was empty , but as soon as the door closed behind the three , they heard a familiar voice emanating from the back of a gown marked by green and blue . 
Not even small , if you do not notice . 
You can go shopping alone . There was a small lullaby and the voice that Harry recognized was Malkin's , shopkeeper , raised , Come on , baby , you're right , no one of us should walk around alone It's because I'm a little girl . Check out where she's attached the button ! A boy with a pale face and white blond hair appeared from behind a clothes rack , wearing a very dark blue suit with sparkling buttons on the hem and wrist . 
He runs to the mirror and admire himself ; It was not long before he recognized Harry , Ron , and Hermione in the mirror , behind him . its light brown eyes shrink . This mother , if she was wondering what the smell was , a Blood Mud had just stepped in , Draco Malfoy said . I do not think it is necessary to use that language ! Mrs. Malkin said , hastily stepping out from behind the clothes rack , holding a tape measure and wand . And I do not want the wand to be raised in my store ! she added hurriedly , glancing toward the doorway , where Ron and Harry both stood with their wands in their hands , pointing towards Malfoy . 
Hermione stood behind them , whispering , no , really , it was not worth doing . Oh , thought you would use magic outside of school , Malfoy smirked . Who has your eye closed purple Granger ? 
I want to give them flowers . that's enough ! Mrs. Malkin said sharply , looking behind her back looking for supporters . Dear Narcissa Malfoy came out from behind the clothes rack . Leaving those out , she said coldly to Harry and Ron . If you guys attack my baby then make sure it is the last thing you guys do . Really ? Said Harry , taking a step forward and looking straight at the slightly haughty face that , in his pale expression , still seemed to resemble her . 
sister 
She was as tall as she was . Will you call some Death Eaters to do that right ? Mrs. Malkin screamed and placed her hand on her heart . Actually , you should not be too dangerous to mention dropping the wand ! But Harry never lowered his wand . 
Narcissa Malfoy laughed uneasily . I find that becoming a Dumbledore's pet has caused him a false sense of security , Harry Potter . 
But Dumbledore is not always there to protect you . Harry looked at the shop mockingly . Wow see you are not here ! 
Then why not make a shot ? 
They will be able to find you a double room in Azkaban with your failed husband's name ! Malfoy moves furiously at Harry , but stumbles over his long gown . 
Ron laughed . You dare say to my mother , Potter ! Malfoy snarled . No problem Draco , Narcissa said , holding it with her thin white fingers on his shoulders . We assume that Potter will reunite with his dear Sirius before we return to reunite with Lucius . Harry brought his wand higher . Harry , do not ! Cried Hermione , grabbing her hand and trying to pull it down the side . Think carefully . You will not be able to pick yourself up . Mrs. Malkin shivered for a moment , and finally decided that nothing happened , just as she had hoped . 
She bent down to Malfoy , still glaring at Harry . I think this left hand can still be a little bit shorter , let's do it ! Malfoy roared , pulling her hand away . 
See where the buttons are attached to the old lady ! 
Mom - I do not need these anymore - She pulled the shirt over her head and threw it on the floor , under Mrs. Malkin's feet . That's right , Draco , Narcissa said with a scornful look at Hermione , now I know what kind of things to buy here . We should go to Twilfitt and Tatting . And then , striding out of the store , Malfoy struggled on Ron as hard as he could on the way out the door . Um , really ? said Malkin , grasping the cloak on the floor and putting the wand on it like a vacuum cleaner , so that it washes away the stains . 
She did not seem to mind to find Ron and Harry's new suit , trying to sell Hermione a witch's shirt , not for women , and finally greet the children out of the same store . The feeling of not wanting to see their faces . Is there anything ? Hagrid asked happily as the children came to him . That's fine , Harry said . Do you see the Malfoys ? Yes , Hagrid said distractedly . They do not dare to do anything miscellaneous in the alley where Harry . do not worried . Harry , Ron , and Hermione turned to look at each other , but before they could pull Hagrid out of that unsettled thought , he and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared , all hugging heavy piles of books , general Are you all right ? Mr. Weasley asked . Is your coat all gone ? Okay , now we can round the Apothecary Shop and Eeylops first on the way to the store of Fred and George - go close together . Both Harry and Ron do not buy any medicine at the Apothecary Shop , because 
They did not study drug poisoning , but they both bought big meatballs for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at the Eeylops Dwarf Center . 
Then , while Mrs. Weasley looked at the clock every minute , they advanced further down the street to find Wizard Weasley's Wheezes , Fred's and George's . 
We do not have much time , says Mrs. Weasley . So we will just look around and get back to the car right away . 
We must be close together , the other is 92 and 94 Ồ ! Said Ron , stopping on the road . erected on the opposite side of the boring Fronts shop , surrounded by billboards around them , the windows of Fred and George's shop hit the eye like a fireworks display . 
Normal passersby were looking over their shoulders in these gleaming windows , and some curious men stood up , stunned . 
The window on the left was dazzling by a bunch of things that were spinning , blinking , the bouncing , the screaming , the screaming ; Harry's eyes were dim by just looking at those things . 
The right window is covered with a large poster , also purple like the Ministry , but is decorated with flashing yellow letters : WHY YOU MUST HAVE LONG ABOUT YOU - WHAT - WHO - ALSO - KNOW - WHO - WHO ? YOU MUST CONSIDER FOR U - NO - POO - - < here Fred and George play the word , U - NOPOO reads much like YOU - KNOW - WHO - the name used to refer to Voldemort . POO is close to POOP , which is a part of the body , say here is not very polite , you look at yourself : D , so can understand U - NO - POO is the no body THAT FEES THE EFFECTS OF THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN INFRINGED . 
Harry started laughing . 
He heard a slight lament behind him and turned around , seeing Mrs. Weasley staring at the picture , dumbfounded . Her lips moved slightly as U - No - Poo . They will be assassinated while they are asleep ! she whispered . No ! Said Ron as he was laughing like Harry was . That's awesome ! Then he and Harry walked into the store . 
It was packed with shoppers ; Harry could not get close to the price . 
He looked around , looking up at the boxes stacked up to the ceiling : the Unbreakable Boxes that the twins had perfected in their unfinished years at Hogwarts ; Harry noticed that Orange Nuggets were bought the most , as there was only one box left on the shelf . 
There are boxes full of dummy wand , the cheapest ones are merely turning into rubber chicks or underpants when raised , while the most expensive ones are the cautious ones . On their heads and necks , there are also self - inking pens , self - examining bugs , and smart answers . 
There was a vacant space left by the crowd , so Harry leaned over the counter , where a group of ten - year - olds were watching excitedly a small woodman stepping up the stairs . to a real hanging rack , both placed on a box labeled : The Retractable Treo - spell it otherwise he will rock on the rack ! Charm Sleeping Day Effect . Hermione tried to squeeze in a large display table near the counter and read the information behind the box carrying a colorful picture of a handsome young man with a girl who was fainting . They both stood on the deck of a pirate ship . Just a simple spell you will enter a 30 minute sleep , with top quality and very real , very suitable for use in normal classes and virtually impossible to detect . Side effects include drowsiness and drowsiness . 
Not sold to children under the age of 16 . You know what , Hermione said , looking up at Harry , that was a top spell ! With that , Hermione , the voice behind them , you can get one for free . Fred , with a bright face in front of them , was wearing a bright red robe , as opposed to his burning hair . How are you , Harry ? They shook hands . And what about your eyes , Hermione ? Your boxing telescope , she said sadly . Oh , I forgot about that , Fred said . Hey It took a tube out of the bag and handed it to her ; He carefully opened it and saw a thick yellow paste . Hatching it up , the violet will lose in an hour , Fred said . We're looking for a neat little bruise remover . 
Now we are testing most of the products on ourselves . Hermione looked worried . Is this safe ? she asked . Definitely , Fred encourages . Come on Harry . 
I ' ll take you around here . Harry allowed Hermione to stain the glue on her bruised eye and followed Fred's footsteps toward the back of the shop , where he saw a full price of fun with the bows and ropes . Muggle's genjutsu ! Fred said cheerfully , pointing at the stuff . For those crazy people like me , you know , people who like Muggle stuff . 
I do not run very well , but it's so stable , that's the new thing . Oh , George here . Fred's twin brother shook Harry warmly . Take it around ? 
Then back to Harry , where we are really making money - this little boy , stealing what you are going to pay for a lot of gold ! He warned the boy to pull his hand out of the tube marked with edible black marks - that would make you sick ! 
George pushed the curtain next to the Muggle magic and Harry saw a dark room , but more spacious . 
But the furniture here is neatly folded . You have just produced a more serious product line , Fred said . It's funny I can not believe it , there are a lot of people , even ministers , who can not make a beautiful charm for a while , George said . Of course they did not ask me to teach them Harry . That's right , we thought the Protector was a bit funny , you know , try challenging my friend to spell it on you when you're wearing this hat and see its face when the spells are up . shoot back . 
But the Ministry ordered 500 items for all the important officials ! 
And you still have other big orders ! So you expand into Protective Coats , and your Protective Gloves think these things can not help in protecting you from Unforgivable Spells , but with spells or And then we thought of entering into the field of Dark Arts , because that was the machine that made the money , George continued excitedly . It's great . 
Look , Dark Night , you import from Peru 
That's it . 
Very convenient if you want to hide someone for fast . And some of our Trapping Fires have just run out of the price , says Fred , pointing to a bunch of peculiar black stuff , like whistles , trying to get out of sight of the kids . You just need to secretly drop one of them just that it will run out and make a great noise in another place , to help you distracted very well . Really , Harry says , impressive . Here for you , George said , picking up some and throwing at Harry . 
A young witch with short blond hair poking his head in the curtain ; Harry saw that she was also wearing a bright red cloak . There is a visitor out there looking for a jeep , Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley , she said . 
Harry found it very unsettling to hear Fred and George calling him Sir Weasley , but the two brothers strode out , as normal . Stay there , Verity , I'm here , George said right away . Harry , take whatever you want . 
Free of charge . I can not do that ! Harry said , he had withdrawn his pocket money to pay for the snatches . You do not have to pay here , Fred said firmly , pushing Harry's gold coins out . But I let you borrow money to start , you have not forgotten , George said sternly . Get whatever you want , and just remember to tell people where you got them if they asked . George flicked through the curtains to help the guests , and Fred took Harry back to the main hall of the store to find Hermione and Ginny , who were still busy studying the Daylight Charm . Have you found our special Wonder Woman products yet ? Fred asked . According to him Window near the window is a row of bright pink products , around are the girls giggling excitedly excited . 
Hermione and Ginny both backed away , looking alarmed . Watch me , Fred says proudly . The best brand of Love Pharmacy that I can not find elsewhere . Ginny raised an eyebrow , suspicious . Is not he effective ? She asked . Sure enough , lasting 24 hours a day , depending on the boy's weight and her attractiveness , George suddenly appeared next to them . But we do not sell to you , it becomes serious , not sold when you have 5 boys surrounded by you . What you hear from Ron is all lies , Ginny said . Gently , lean forward to pick up a small pink jar from the rack . What is this ? Make sure you clear all pimples within 10 seconds , says Fred . Works with everything from boil to blackheads , but do not get drunk . 
Are you currently dating or not dating a boy named Dean Thomas ? Yes , I do , Ginny says . And the last time I met him , he was really a person , not a year . 
What are those other things ? She pointed at a handful of round , fluffy pink and purple feathers , all hovering around the floor of a cage and emitting a little chit . Dwarf , George said . The rolls of wool ejaculated in miniature , you can not produce anymore . 
What about Michael Corner ? I left him , he was just a bad guy , Ginny said , poking a finger into the cage bar and watching the Dwarf Pong surrounded it . They're pretty ! They are very quiet , right , Fred admitted . But are you changing your boyfriend a bit quickly ? Ginny turned to look at her , her hands up against the ribs . 
There is a look of Mrs. Weasley on her face , which makes Harry seem surprised to see Fred refuse . That's not my job . 
And thank you again , she turns angry with Ron , who is crawling under George's elbow , hugging a pile of belongings , for not telling the romance about me to them . All three were Galleon , nine Sickle and one Knut , Fred said while checking a box of Ron's hands . Get out . I'm your brother ! And what you're spinning is ours . 
Three Galleon , nine Sickle . 
You give me a Knut . But I did not have three Galleons , nine Sickles ! Then you leave , and remember to put in the right place of it . Ron dropped a few boxes , swearing , and made a very fierce act on Fred , who was unfortunately murdered by Mrs. Weasley , who chose the right time to appear . If you see me doing that again , I ' ll stick my hands together , she said sternly . Mommy , give me a baby Dwarf Eh ? Ginny said immediately . What a Mrs. Weasley said cautiously . Look at the mother , they are so cute . Mrs. Weasley moved aside to see the Dwarf Curses , while Harry , Ron , and Hermione had a comfortable view out the window for a moment . 
Draco Malfoy is running alone on the street . 
As it ran through Weasley's Wizard Wheezes , it looked back . 
After a few seconds , it passed out of sight and they no longer saw it . Where does she know where her mother is ? Harry worried . Perhaps it was hiding from his mother , in the way he ran , Ron said . Why ? Asked Hermione . 
Harry did not say anything ; it is very lively . 
Narcissa Malfoy would not volunteer to let her baby go out of her sight ; Malfoy struggles to free himself from her arms . 
Harry , very understanding and disgusted Malfoy , knew for certain that the reason for the escape was not innocuous . 
He looked around . 
Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bent down beside the Dwarfs . 
Mr. Weasley is eagerly researching the Muggle boxes . 
Fred and George are helping the other guests . On the other side of the glass door , Hagrid was sitting with his back on them , looking around the street . Clap here , hurry , Harry said , pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag . Oh , I do not know anymore Harry , Hermione looked at Mrs. Weasley , hesitant . Come on Ron , please . 
She hesitated for a second , then went inside with Harry and Ron . 
No one noticed that they had disappeared ; All are attracted by the things of Fred and George . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione made their way out the door as quickly as possible , but when they came to the street , Malfoy vanished completely as they tried to get away . 
It's going to be that way , Harry whispered in the softest voice he could , so that Hagrid could not hear it . They rushed , looking right and left , through the windows and doors of the shops , until Hermione was up . Is not it ? she whispered . Turn left ? A big surprise , Ron answered . 
Malfoy looked around , then darted in Knockturn Knock out of sight . Hurry up , do not lose it now , Harry said , running fast forward . People see their legs lose ! Hermione said with obvious anxiety as her robe fluttered around the little ankles ; At this time , it was hard to cover all three of the shirts . No problem , Harry said impatiently . Hurry up ! But the Knockturn Knob , the street just for Dark Arts , is utterly ridiculous . 
Children look at the windows when passing , but no one seems to have a shop . 
Harry was right that it was a great accusation for someone to spend the harsh and ill - fated moments of buying instruments - or at least , being seen to buy those things . 
Hermione pushed hard into his hand . Oh ! Shh ! 
Look ! 
It's in it ! she whispered into Harry's ear . 
They had stopped at the only store in Knockturn Knob that Harry had ever been to , the Borgins and Burkes , which sold a lot of dark stuff . In the middle of the shelves filled with old bones and bottles , Draco Malfoy was turning his back on her three children , appearing behind a huge black box that Harry once hid in order to avoid Malfoy and his father . it . 
In the way Malfoy raised his hand , he was talking to someone with his hand . 
The owner of the store , old Borgin , a shrunken man with sloppy hair , was standing in front of Malfoy . 
He is having a curious feeling with the mix of anger and fear . If we hear what they say , it's good ! Said Hermione . Can it ! Ron is fervent . Stand still damn It drops more boxes in hand as it fumbles in the loudest . Long Connected , look here ! Too great ! Hermione said , as Ron removed the long strands of human skin and began pointing them toward the door . Oh , I hope the door is not infiltrated . Ron is happy . Listen ! The youngsters bunched their heads together and listened at this end of the string . Malfoy's voice was loud and clear , like a radio . 
You know how to fix it ? Maybe , Borgin said in a voice that made me realize that he did not want to do it himself . I want to see it . 
Why do not you bring it to the store ? I can not , Malfoy said . It must stay in its place . 
I just need to show me how to do it . Harry saw Borgin lick his lips , nervous expression . Hmmm , if you do not watch live , I think that the work will be very difficult , perhaps impossible . 
I can not be sure of anything . No ? Malfoy said , and Harry knew that , with that kind of voice , Malfoy smirked . Maybe this will make him more confident . She moved towards Borgin and was hidden behind the closet . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione all dragged aside , trying to observe it but all 
They saw Borgin , who seemed to be very scared . Tell anyone , says Malfoy , and will immediately be punished . 
Do you know Fenrir Greyback ? 
He is a friend of the family . 
He will visit regularly to make sure that he gives this work the most thorough care . Probably not necessary I will decide that , Malfoy said . Now , I should leave here more . 
And do not forget to keep that safe with you , I ' ll need it . Maybe you want to get it now ? No , I certainly do not need it now , old man , how can I bring that thing down the street ? 
Just do not sell it to anyone else . Of course not . Borgin bends like he once saw him greet Lucius Malfoy . Do not tell anyone Borgnine , and that includes my mother , understand ? Of course , of course , Borgin whispered , and bowed again . 
Moments later , the doorbell shook and Malfoy stepped out of the store , looking very satisfied . 
He walked past Harry , Ron , and Hermione so close that they could feel the robes flutter around his ankles . 
In the store , Borgin stood still like a grain of rice , his sweet , sweet smile vanishing , and he seemed worried . How is that ? Ron whispered , rolling back the Long Attempts . Did not know , Harry thought very wiggle . He wants to fix something and he wants to order something in there . Can you see what it's offering when it says ' that ' ? No , it's behind the cabinet . You two are here , Hermione whispered . What do you do ? But Hermione got out of the cloak . 
She corrected her hair with a reflection in the window , then stepped confidently into the shop , making the bell ring again . 
Ron quickly pushed his Long Ears back under the door and gave Harry a head . Hi , a bad morning , is not it ? Hermione spoke happily to Borgin , who did not answer , only looking at her with suspicion . 
Whistling , Hermione glided through a number of miscellaneous items on display . Does this necklace sell ? she asked , stopping in front of a shelf with a glass front . If she had a thousand and a half Galleons , he said coldly . Oh - - hmm - - no , I did not have that , Hermione continued to walk . 
What about this beautiful skull ? Sixteen Galleons . So it's for sale ? Is not it kept for somebody ? Borgin rolled his eyes to her . 
Harry has a hard feeling that he knows exactly what Hermione wants to do . 
Notice that Hermione was also nervous because she suddenly said it . The problem is , the little boy just came from here , Draco Malfoy , is a friend of mine , and I want to buy him a birthday present , but if he had booked something And then I did not want to buy him the exact same thing , so it was a lame joke in Harry's mind , and it was clear that Borgin thought so too . Out right , he screamed . Get out of here now ! 
Hermione did not wait to be reminded for a second , and she rushed out the door with Borgin chasing after him . 
When the bell rang , Borgin closed the door and hung up the sign . Hmm , Ron said , covering Hermione's shirt . It's worth a try , but you've gotten a good look , next time to see how you did Master's Magic ! little girl 
Ron and Hermione argued all the way back to Weasley's Weeeley Wizard Wheezes , where they were forced to stop so undiscovered by Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid , who seemed nervous to know that the children disappeared . 
Once inside the shop , Harry pulls off the invisibility cloak , hides it in his purse , and joins the other two while they are trying to clear up , under the accusation of Mrs. Weasley , that the gang They were only in the back room , and that she did not look around the store . 
Chapter 7 Slug Club 
Harry spent much of his last week in the holiday pondering the meaning of Malfoy's actions in Knockturn Knob . What made him wonder was the look on Malfoy's face as he left the store . 
Nothing makes Malfoy look so happy except for the good news . This gives Harry a bit of a dislike , however , both Ron and Hermione seem not to be curious about Malfoy's actions as he does , or at least , they seem to be bothered by discussing it after a few . day . Yes , I agree with him , Harry , Hermione said with impatience . 
She was sitting on a window in Fred and Geogre's room and stepped onto a cardboard case and looked up reluctantly as she read a new Rune translation . But do not we agree that there are many explanations ? Maybe he broke the knack of his reputation . Ron said suspiciously while he was trying to straighten his broomsticks . Do you remember Malfoy's curly arm ? But about the sentence that it says , ' do not forget to keep that person safe ' ? Harry asked this question does not know how much . This to me seems to have Borgin just had one of the broken objects , and Malfoy wants both . You guess ? Said Ron , while trying to scrape the stains off his broom . Yes , of course , said Harry . 
While Ron or Hermione did not answer , he continued , Malfoy's father was in Azkaban's prison . 
Do you think Malfoy wants revenge ? Ron looked up , blinking . Malfoy ? 
Revenge ? 
How can it do that ? That's just my opinion , I do not know ! Harry said wearily . But he is behind something and I think we should keep an eye on this matter seriously . 
His father is the Death Eater and - Harr stopped , his eyes on the window behind Hermione , and his mouth opened . 
A sudden thought appeared in his mind . 
Harry ? Said Hermione nervously . What is going on ? Your scar is hurt again ? Ron asked nervously . He was a Death Eater , Harry said slowly . It was replaced by her father as Death Eater . A silence enveloped the room , and Ron was interrupted by a laugh . Malfoy ? 
It's only sixteen Harry ! 
Who do you think would let Malfoy join ? This does not seem likely , Harry , Hermione said with a faltering tone . What makes you think - ? That's about Mrs. Malkin . 
She did not touch it , but it screamed and tugged at her arm from her grandmother as she came to unbutton his sleeve . that is his left hand . 
He was engraved with a black mark . Ron and Hermione looked at each other . Well , yes .... Said Ron , seemingly unconvinced . I think it just wanted to go out , Harry , Hermione said . He gave Borgin something that we could not see , Harry continued stubbornly . Something that really scared the Borgin . That was the sign , to that - he gave the guy he was contracting - Borgin saw that , they saw how serious Borgin was to him ! Ron and Hermione give each other a different look . I'm not sure , Harry ... Yes , I still do not think that You - Know - It will let Malfoy join ... Feeling uncomfortable , but completely convinced that he was right , Harry took Get up to fifty Quidditch robes and leave the room ; Mrs. Weasley has emphasized them for many days that they would not be allowed to wash their clothes until the last minute . 
As he goes down to the floor he encounters Ginny , who is heading back to the room carrying a stack of carefully washed clothes . I will not be in the kitchen right now , Baby boy warned him . There are many Phlegm around there . He will be careful not to get caught in it . Harry laughed . 
Quite confident , when he was in the kitchen , Fleur was sitting at the table , in a series of plans for her wedding with Bill , while Mrs. Weasley watched as Bruken crushed herself , really irritable . 
.... 
Bill and I almost certainly decided to have only two bridesmaids , Ginny and Gabrielle would look great . 
I thought about using the yellow - pink color zem would be great with Ginny's hair - Ah , Harry ! Mrs. Weasley shouted , interrupting Fleur's monologue . I would like to explain the security arrangements for the trip to Hogwarts tomorrow . 
We will use the Ministry of Magic again , and there will be bright gods waiting at the station - Tonks will be there ? Harry asked , his hands on the Quidditch stuff . No , you do not . 
She closed the station somewhere else according to information from Arthur . She left her alone . Fleur dreamed , while checking her wonderful silhouette reflected in the cup of tea . What a big mistake if you ask - Yes , thank you , Mrs. Weasley said harshly , interrupting Fleur's words again . If you're prepared , Harry . 
You want the chests ready tonight , if you can , and we will not have the last minute running as usual . And in fact , people's journey the next morning more fluent than usual . 
The vehicle of the Ministry of Magic hovering in front of the Burrow Farm to welcome the waiting group , 
with the trunks arranged ; Hermione's cats , Crookshanks , are safely in their travel basket , and Hedwig , Ron's owl , Pig - widgeon , and Ginny's ghost named Pygmy Puff and Arnold are thrown into the cage . Au revoir , ' Any ( bye Harry ) , Fleur said hoarse and kisses him goodbye . 
Ron followed in a hurry , looking gloomy , but Ginny got stuck and Ron got hit by him , lying on the dirty dirt at Fleur's feet . 
Confused to blush , and around the stains splashing , he rushed into the car without saying goodbye . 
At the crossroads the King was without Hagrid's uncle welcome . 
Instead , the two bright - faced gods , bearded in their Muggle outfits , approached the car as it stopped , and around the back , leading them into the station without saying a single word . Hurry , hurry up , through the fence ! Mrs. Weasley was disturbed , as if she was disturbed by the cold men . Harry should go ahead , with - She looked curious at a genie , he nodded briefly , pulled Harry's hand , and directed him toward the fence between platform number 9 and number 10 . Thanks , I got a ticket . , Harry said irritably , shaking his hand away from the bright angel . 
He pushed the luggage cart straight into the bar , trying not to notice the companion's silence , and a moment later , found himself standing on a nine - and - a - quarter - meter platform where the secret train to Hogwarts standing out in the middle of the crowd . 
Hermione and the Weasley followed him just seconds later . 
And without waiting to consult the Spirit of his evil face , Harry reminded Ron and Hermione to follow him on the platform , looking for an empty car . We can not , Harry , she said apologetically . Ron and I had to go to the Chief's cabin and patrol the corridors one by one . Oh yes , I forgot , Harry said . You should go straight on the train , all of you , you only have a few minutes to go , Mrs. Weasley said . Um , there's a happy semester , Ron ... Uncle Weasley , can I have a few ? Said Harry , and tried to concentrate his mind . Of course , Mr. Weasley said , looked surprised , but also followed Harry out of the reach of others . 
Harry thought about this carefully , and came to the conclusion that , if he had to tell anyone , Mr. Weasley was the best man , because he worked in the Ministry of Magic and was in a good position . to investigate further , and second , because he thought it was not enough to make Mr. Weasley mad . 
He could see Mrs. Weasley and Mr. Shen shaking with suspicion of them when they came out . When we were at Diagon Alley , Harry started , but Mr. Weasley blocked him with a grimace . Are you being discovered where you , Ron and Hermione disappear , until you are in the back room of Fred and Geogre ? How - ? Harry , please . 
I'm talking to someone who has raised Fred and Geogre . Yeah ... yes , we were not in the back room . Yes , then , listen to the worst . Well , they were following Draco Malfoy . 
We used the Invisibility Cloak . Do you have any specific reasons for doing so , or is it just an improvisation ? Because I thought Malfoy was behind something , Harry said , ignoring Mr Weasley's furious and curious look . He gave her a cloak and she wanted to know why . Of course I did , Mr. Weasley said , seemingly suppressed . And , we found out 
Why ? He entered Borgs and Burkes , Harry said , and threatened him in there , Borgin , to help him fix something . 
He says he wants Borgin to keep something else for him . 
It does it as if it's something that needs to be repaired . 
And it looks like they have a pair . 
And ... Harry stopped , took a deep breath . There is something else . 
We see Malfoy jumping up the meter as Mrs. Malkin tries to touch her left hand . 
I think it was engraved black , I think it was replaced by his father's position as a Death Eater . Mr. Weasley looked a little backward . 
After a moment he said , Harry , I doubt that You - Know - It can allow a sixteen - year - old kid - Does anyone really know what He - Who - Well - knows would or will not do ? Harry asked angrily . Uncle Weasley , I'm sorry , but is this valid for an investigation ? 
If Malfoy wants something to be repaired , and it needs to threaten Borgin to do that , that is likely to be a dark or dangerous item , right ? I doubt it , frankly , Harry , Mr. Weasley said slowly . You see , when Lucius Malfoy was arrested , we searched his house . 
We carry everything that can be dangerous . I think you missed something . Harry said irritably . Um , maybe , Mr. Weasley said , but Harry could have said Mr. Weasley was joking around . 
There was a siren behind them , most of them got on the train and the door was closed . I better hurry up ! Mr. Weasley said , while Mrs. Weasley screamed , Harry , hurry ! Harry hurried along and the two weasley helped him to put the chest on the train . And now , my dear , I will come to our house at Christmas , everything is set by Dumbledore , so we ' ll see you soon , Mrs. Weasley said through the window , while Harry closed the door behind him and the ship began to move . Take care of yourself carefully and - The ship is now accelerating . 
- try to be better and - she ran after said . " Keep it safe ! " Harry waved goodbye until the ship reached the turn and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were out of sight , and he turned to see the others . 
He guessed that Ron and Hermione were in the Chief's compartment , but Ginny was only a short distance away from him in the corridor , and she was chatting with some friends . 
Harry turned to the little girl and dragged the chests around . 
Everyone was staring at him as he approached . 
They even peered into the car window to look at him more closely . 
He had anticipated these bizarre views when he would have had to undergo a year of study after the Opticians were on the Prophet's diary , but he was not interested in the feeling of standing at one point . bright . 
He patted Ginny's shoulders . " I want to go find an empty compartment ? " I can not , Harry , you said you would meet Dean , Ginny said cheerfully . See you later . okay ! , Said Harry . 
He felt a strange stir of discomfort as she walked away , her red hair dancing behind her , he was so used to her presence during the summer that the bridge almost forgot Ginny did not play with him , Ron and Hermione at school . 
Then he blinked and looked around : He was surrounded by seductive girls . Hello Harry ! a familiar voice resounded behind him . 
Neville ! Harry said relievedly , and turned to look at the round - faced boy trying to cross the crowd toward him . Hello Harry , a girl with long hair and big dreamy eyes , standing behind Neville exclaimed . Hello Luna , are you ok ? Very well , thank you , Luna said . 
She is clutching a magazine under her arm , the letters on her head indicate that she has a pair of free Spectrespecs in her pocket . Does the Wei Chibi thrive then ? Asked Harry , and felt a real interest in the newspaper that had posted a special interview last year . 
Oh yes , things keep turning around , Luna said happily . Find a place to sit , Harry said , and the trio crossed the train through the curious , curious study crowd . 
Finally , they found an empty carriage , and Harry came in excitedly . Do they even look at us ? Neville said , ' Cause we're with you ! They look at you because you were in the magic ! , Said Harry , as he pulled the chest into the luggage compartment . 
Our little adventure is now on the Prophet's face , and he must have read it . Yes , I think she would be angry about this public publication , Neville said , but she was happy . 
She said she started living like her father . 
You bought yourself a new wand , look ! He pulled the wand and gave it to Harry . Cherry and unicorn , he proudly said . 
We thought it was one of the last chopsticks Ollivander ever sold , he disappeared the next day - oh , come back here Trevor ! And he bent down under his chair to look for a toad when he made a free - search operation as usual . Do we still hold group meetings D . A this year , Harry ? Luna asked as she removed the illusion glasses from the Weiqiqian newspaper . At least we got rid of Umbridge , right ? Said Harry and sat down . 
Neville leaned back on the chair as he crawled up . 
He looked very disappointed . I love D . A ! 
I learned a lot from you ! I also enjoy the meetings , Luna said calmly . 
It's like having friends . This was one of the uncomfortable things Luna used to say and made Harry feel both embarrassed and confused . 
However , before he could pay , there was a noise outside their carriages , a group of four - year - old girls were whispering and giggling at the other side of the glass . You asked him ! No , you ! I ' ll do it ! And one of them , a prominent girl with big black eyes , a raised chin , and long black hair pushed the door in . Hi , Harry , my name is Romilda , Romilda Vane , she says loudly and confidently . Why do not you join us in our car ? 
You do not have to sit with them , she added , with a whispered voice , pointing at Neville trying to grab the Trevor under the chair , and Luna , who was wearing her free Spectrespecs shield she looked like a Owl with color mutiny . They are friends of mine , Harry said coldly . 
Oh , the girl said , looking very surprised . Oh , fine . And she left , slamming the door . People think you have better friends than us 10 times , Luna said , showing embarrassed embarrassment . You're so cool , Harry said shortly . None of them were with me at the Ministry of Magic . 
They did not fight me . That was a great excuse , Luna smiled brightly , and pulled the Spectrespecs away from the nose a little and sat down to read the Weapon . However , we did not face him , Neville said again . stepping out of the chair with spider webs and dirt on his head with a furious look at the Trevor on his arm . You're , Harry . 
You should hear my grandmother talk about you . " That Harry Potter boy has more ribs than the entire Ministry of Magic combined ! ' She will give everything to have you as a grandson . ' Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL as soon as he could . 
Meanwhile , Neville read aloud of his results and wondered when he could take the NEWT transfiguration , with only one possibility of being agreed , Harry looked at him without actually listening . 
Neville's childhood was devastated by Voldemort as much as Harry had gone through , but Neville had no idea how close he was to Harry's fate . 
The prophecy may be speculated for both of them , however , for some mysterious reason , Voldemort chose to believe that Harry was the only one mentioned in the prophecy . 
If Voldemort chooses Neville , it is possible that Neville was sitting opposite Harry and endured the lightning scar and the weight of the prophecy . 
Or can that be ? 
Had Neville's mother died to protect him , just as Lily had sacrificed for Harry ? 
Surely she will do it . 
But what if she could not stand between her child and Voldemort ? 
Is not there a chosen person ? 
An empty seat where Neville was sitting and a scarred Harry could be kissed and say goodbye to his mother , not Ron's mother ? Are you alright , Harry ? 
You look so funny , Neville said . 
Harry started . Sorry - me - Algae caught you then ? Luna asked sympathetically , looking at Harry through her huge glasses . I - what ? Algae spray ... 
They are invisible . 
They drifted through his ears and made his brain become silly , she said . 
I think I feel a baby looking around here . She clapped her hands in the air , as if she were beating an invisible monster . 
Harry and Neville looked at one another and hurried over to talk about Quidditch . 
The weather outside the bay window was like a summer day , they hit a thick , cold mist , and then went under the light of the sun . 
As the train enters the area of ​​ bright spells , when the sun appears at the top of the head , Ron and Hermione enter the cabin . As soon as lunch arrives , I'm starving . Speaking very earnestly , and letting him down to Harry's side and rubbing his belly . Hi , Neville . 
Hi , Luna . 
Try to guess what happens ? He added , turning to Harry . Malfoy is not on duty as a leader . 
It was sitting in its carriage with the Slytherins , we came across it . Harry straightened up , looking interested . This is not the same as Malfoy often demonstrating the power of the Chief , which was always happy in the past year . What is it doing when you see it ? As usual , Ron said indifferently , pretending to be rude on his hands . Not like him , right ? Well - that's it - and he made that gesture again - But why did not he glide beyond the first year ? 
Not yet , Harry said , but his mind was dancing . Does this seem like Malfoy has something more in her mind than threatening the lower grades ? Maybe he likes a Strange Group , says Hermione . Perhaps the fact that Huynh Tranh became so bland after these things . I do not think so , Harry said . I thought it was - But before he could present his hypothesis , the door of the cabin opened again , and a third - year - old girl breathed in and out of breath . I was about to go to Neville Longbotton and Harry P - Potter , hesitant , when her eyes met Harry and she flushed . 
She was holding two rolls of parchment wrapped with purple ribbons . 
In an incomprehensible way , Harry and Neville took each other's rolls of paper as she rushed out of the cabin . 
What is this ? Ron was curious because Harry had not opened it . An invitation , Harry said . 
Harry , I'm happy if you can join me at lunch in C car . 
Love ... . 
But what does he want to do to me ? Neville asked , confused as he anticipated this was a banquet . Do not know . Harry said that he was not entirely sure , and that he had no evidence that his theory was correct . Listen , he said , and with an idea emerging , use the Invisibility Cloak , and we can have a clear view of Malfoy along the way , see what he is behind . However , this idea does not give anything . 
The corridors were packed by people waiting for lunch carts , completely unable to go together while wearing their shirts . 
Harry tucked it regretfully into the pair , pondering the cool thing to wear to avoid staring , which seemed to grow stronger even when he got off the train . 
Often , the students squeeze out of their compartment to look at him more clearly . 
The exception is Cho Chang , who jumps into the cabin when Harry arrives . 
As Harry walked through the door , he saw the girl arguing with her friend Marietta , who had a thick makeup on her face that did not completely obscure the peculiar information of the boils still lurking on her . her face . 
Harry smiled gently and walked over . 
When they arrive at C , they find that they are not the only guests of Slughorn , though , judging by Slughorn's warm welcome , Harry is almost universally known . 
Harry , my boy ! Slughorn exclaimed , jumping on him , making his belly appear to fill the rest of the cabin . 
The bald head and silver beard glittered like putting yellow buttons on his shirt under the sun . Nice to meet you , very happy ! 
And you must be Longbotton ! Neville nodded , looking frightened . 
At the direction of Sluhorn , they sat facing each other in only the two nearest gates . 
Harry glanced around at the passengers . 
He recognized a Slytherin student , a high black boy with long , high cheek , oblique eyes , and there were two seventeen - year - old boys that Harry did not know , and , in the corner next to Slughorn , Ginny , she looked as if she was not sure how she got here . Now , do you know everyone ? Slughorn asks Harry and Neville . 
Of course , Balily Zabini was locked up with them - Zabini did not show any sign of welcome or expression , neither did Harry and Neville . 
Gryffindor and Slytherin students do not like each other . This is Cormac McLaggen , maybe we just met - ? 
Are not you ? 
McLaggen was a good - looking boy with a good hand , and Harry and Neville nodded back to him . - And this is Marcus Belby , I do not know if - ? Belby is a thin and shy - looking boy , smiling with compassion for Harry . 
- and this charming young lady tells me she knows two children ! Slughorn finished . 
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn . And now , this is the best , Slughorn said excitedly . 
It's a chance for you to know each other a little more . this is a napkin . 
I have packed my lunch ; The trolley , as I remember it , its food has many essays , and the belly of this poor old man can not bear such things .... 
Turn the chicken , Belby ? 
Belby nodded in agreement that something like half a chicken turned . Here I tell Marcus that I have the honor to teach Uncle Damcoles his , Slughorn tells Harry and Neville , while they are passing each other a basket of bread . Excellent , excellent , and Merlin's Medal is perfectly worth it . 
Did you meet my uncle , Marcus ? 
Unfortunately , Belby had just thrown a large chunk of chicken into his mouth , and he hurriedly threw the pile into his stomach so fast that he was choking , his face turned purple , and began to chase . Anapeo , Slughorn said lightly , pointing his wand at Belby , and it seemed that the boy's throat was immediately exposed . 
No , not much , not much , Belby gasped , eyes straight . Of course , I dare say that he is very busy , Slughorn said , looking at Belby . I doubt that he invented the wolfsbane without a proper effort ! I suppose ... Belby said , he looked reluctant to take another rooster until he was sure Slughorn was done . 
Oh ... he and his father are not really harmonious , you see , I do not really know much about ... His voice dropped and stopped when Slughorn handed him a cold smile and turned . to McLaggen . And you , Cormac , Slughorn said , I know you met my Tiberius very much , because he has a gorgeous picture of his two nigger on a nogtails , I think so , right ? Oh yes , that was interesting , really , McLaggen said . I went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour - of course before he became minister - Ah , you know about Bertie and Rufus ? Slughorn smiled , and handed out a small tray with pears , and somehow , Belby was forgotten . Now tell me ... that's all that Harry suspected . 
The people here seem to be invited because they have some kind of connection with someone famous or powerful - everyone except Ginny . 
Zabini , who was asked after McLaggen , was a mother of a beautiful sorceress ( and from what Harry knew , she had married seven times , and her husbands died mysteriously and left her the mountain gold ) . 
And then Neville . 
That moment was very uncomfortable , about Neville's parents , the famous gods , who had been tortured to death by Bellatrx Lestrange , and another Death Eater . 
And after an interview with Neville , Harry had the impression that Slughorn had been more reserved than Neville , but to see if he had the talent of a parent . And now , Slughorn says , turns to the style of a celebrity host . Harry Potter ! 
Where to start ? 
We see only through the surface when we meet in the summer ! He looked at Harry for a moment as if he were a big and delicious piece of chicken , and then said , ' You 
Choose , ' they're calling me that ! Harry did not say anything . 
Belby , McLaggen and Zabini were staring at him . Of course , Slughorn said , looking closer Harry , there are rumors for years ... 
I remember - yes - after that horrible night - Lily - James - and I survived - and the world knows that you have the power beyond imagination . - Zabini coughs a slight suspicion of the hypothesis . This . 
A slurred voice came from Slughorn . Yes , Zabini , because you're so talented ... in making gestures ... Oh darling ! Slughorn laughed , looking at Ginny , who was glaring at Zabini , who was sitting next to Slughorn . You must be more careful , Blaise ! 
I saw this little girl doing Magic Saber - Three Piece the best way when I walked through her compartment ! 
I will not go through her ! Zabini's expression looked disdainful . Anyhow , Slughorn said , turning to Harry . Rumors during this summer . 
Of course , a person who does not know what to believe , the Prophet is famous for typing errors , making mistakes - but here there is a small doubt , allowing the heap of witnesses , in The mess in the Magic set and the children there in the halo ! Harry did not see any way out of this , nodding but still not saying anything . 
Slughorn smiled back at him . Too modest , too modest , I do not doubt why Dumbledore liked - I was also there , right ? 
But the whole story - too sensational , of course , one does not know what to believe - that prophecy , for example - - We never heard the prophecy , Neville said , flushed . That's right , Ginny said calmly . Neville and I are also there , and all the silly Pickers are just the usual story of the Prophet . You two were already there , right ? Slughorn said with great excitement , looking at Ginny and Neville , but they both sat quietly in front of his encouraging smile . 
Yes ... . 
Um ... that is the fact that the Prophet often exaggerated everything , of course ... Slughorn said , sounding a little disappointed . I remember Gwenog loved to say that ( of course , Gwenog Jones , the captain of the masters ) - He was in a long chain of flashbacks , but Harry had a slight feeling that Slughorn was not finished with . he , and that he was not convinced by Neville and Ginny . 
The afternoon is dedicated to talking more about the famous sorcerers Slughorn has taught , all of them are excited to join what he calls the Slug Club at Hogwarts . 
Harry could not take it anymore , but he did not know how to go about it . 
Finally , the ship slipped out of the dense fog outside the blazing red sunset , and Slughorn looked around , looking at the blurry scene . Oh , it's dark ! 
I did not notice that they turned on the lights ! 
You can go and change your gown , all your grandchildren . 
McLaggen , I have to buy the book on the broken nogtails . 
Harry , Blaise - when can you pass ? 
You too , he stopped at Ginny . Oh , come on , come on ! As he pushed Harry into the dark corridor , Zabibi looked at Harry uncomfortably as he seemed interested . 
Ginny and Neville followed Zabini back along the ship . I'm happy it's over , Neville whispered . A strange man , right ? Yeah , that's right , Harry said , looking at Zabini . 
How did you get into that , Ginny ? I see you curse Zacharias Smith , Ginny said . You remember the idiot word 
Hufflepuff that is in D . A ? He went around and asked me what had happened in the Magic Set and finally , he made me all up and I cursed him - then Slughorn came in and I thought I was going to have a banquet , But he just thought he made this spell very well and invited me to lunch ! 
Slightly crazy , huh ? That's better than inviting someone because of their mother's popularity , Harry said , scowling at Zabini , or by their uncle - - But he stopped short . 
A thought appeared in his mind , reckless but brilliant idea ... 
Within a minute , Zabini was about to return to the sixth Slytherin room , and Malfoy would sit there , thinking he was not heard except for the Slytherins ... 
If Harry could only go in , not be seen , behind him , he would hear or see ? That's right , the journey was a bit longer - Hogsmeade Station was only about half an hour away , leaning against the light that flickered out the window - - But no one else seemed ready to accept Harry's suspicion . Seriously , and you can not show them . I ' ll see you later , Harry said , pulling on the Invisibility Cloak and covering him up . 
But you - ? Asked Neville . later ! Harry whispered , chasing Zabini as fast as he could , though the roar of the train made this careless . 
The corridors are almost empty now . 
Most people have returned to their carriages to change their uniforms , robes , and cleaners . 
Although Harry was close enough to catch up with Zabini without touching him , Harry did not get up quickly to jump into the train when Zabini opened the door . 
Zabini pulled it shut when Harry hurriedly inserted his foot to keep it closed . What's with this ? Zabini said furiously and pulled the door back to Harry's leg . 
Harry grabbed the door and pushed it open , barely ; and Zabini still grasped the handle , falling into Gregory Goyle's shirt , causing a stir . 
Harry jumps into the car , jumps into the temporary vacuum of Zabini and climbs into the luggage compartment . 
Luckily , Goyle and Zabini are snarling at each other , looking at each other , and Harry is quite sure that his feet are revealed when his shirt is down around them , and for the moment he thinks he has . saw Malfoy's eyes see it . 
But then Goyles slammed the door and pushed Zabini away ; Zabini collapsed onto the seat with a loss of calm , Vincent Crabbe continued his story , and Malfoy laughed , lying between the two with the panty on Pansy Parkinsons shirt . 
Harry curled up uncomfortably under the cloak to make sure that each part of his body remained hidden , and watched Pansy stroke his blond hair down to Malfoy's forehead , giggling as he did , as if anyone had to fall in love . sitting next to the neck . 
The lantern bouncing across the ceiling was shining brightly : Harry could read every word of Crabbe's book below him . So , Zabini , Malfoy said , what would Slughorn want ? Just trying to make good connections , Zabini said as he growled with Goyles . 
And he was trying so hard . 
This information does not seem to satisfy Malfoy . Who else have you invited ? she asked again . McLaggen from Gryffindor , Zabini said . Oh yes , his uncle was very big in magic , Malfoy said . 
- someone else called Belby , from Ravenclaw - Not him , he is a fool ! Says Pansy . 
- and Longbotton , Potter and the Weasleys , Zabini ended . 
Malfoy stood up suddenly , pounding on Pansy's hand . 
Did you invite Longbotton ? . Yes , yes , because Longbottom was there , Zabini said depressed . What is Sloughorn's favorite Longbottom ? Zabini shrugged . Great Potter , Potter , he obviously wanted to see the Pick , Malfoy growled , but the Weasley baby ! 
What is special about her ? Many boys like it , Pansy said , looking at Malfoy standing in the corner to see the reaction of it . Even you think she looks good , is not she , Blaise , and we all know how difficult you are to accept this ! I will not touch its filthy bloodstream no matter what it looks like , says Zabini coldly , and Pansy looks satisfied . 
Malfoy lay down on her shirt and allowed her to continue playing with his hair . Well , I feel sorry for the old Slughorn . 
Maybe he is getting old . 
Shame , my dad always said he was a good witch in the days before . 
My father is often idol . 
Slughorn probably never heard me on the train , or - I did not expect the invitation , Zabini said . He asked me about Father Notts when I arrived . 
They were , of course , old friends , but when he heard he was caught by the Ministry of Magic he looked unhappy , and Nott did not have an invitation , did he ? 
I do not think Slughorn enjoyed the Death Eaters . Malfoy looked angry , but turned out to be an unusual bud . 
Um , who cares about what ? 
What is it , when you come down with him ? 
Just a stupid teacher . Malfoy's mouth bragged . 
I mean , I'm not even in Hogwarts next year , is that a problem when an old man likes me ? What do you mean , you may not be in Hogwarts next year ? Pansy said indignantly , and stopped playing Malfoy's hair . Ha , you will not know , Malfoy said with the evil smile . I can - oh - move on to bigger and better things . Hiding in the luggage under the invisibility cloak , Harry's heart began to dance . 
What would Ron and Hermione say about this ? 
Crabbe and Goyle were looking up at Malfoy ; Obviously they have no idea what the plan is for moving to bigger and better things . 
Even Zabini lets look curious instead of the usual haughty look . 
Pansy continued to play Malfoy's hair , looking surprised . Did you mean it ? " Malfoy shrugged . I want to finish my studies , but personally , I do not think it's important in these days . 
I mean , think about ... when the Dark Lord takes over , does he care how much OWL or N . E . W . T . S . 
Of course not ... All is just services for him , the level of sacrifice he saw . And you think you can do something for him ? Zabini sarcastically . Sixteen and not yet qualified ? Tau just said , right ? 
Maybe he does not care if he's fit or not . 
Maybe the job he does is not what you need to be qualified for , Malfoy said slowly . 
Crabbe and Goyle sat with their mouth open like a gutter . 
Pansy stared down at Malfoy as if she had never seen anything so horrible . I saw Hogwarts , Malfoy said , and realized the effect it had caused when he pointed out the black window . We should wear a gown to fit . 
Harry was too attentive to look at Malfoy so he did not notice Goygle reaching for his suitcase , and dragged the suit down , it hit Harry hard on his head . 
He accidentally uttered a painful sound , and Malfoy looked up at the luggage compartment , anxious . 
Harry was not afraid of Malfoy , but he did not like the thought of being discovered under the Invisibility Cloak by an unfriendly Slytherin . 
Tears still flowing and his head still aching , he pulled his chopsticks , trying not to mess up the shirt , and waited , holding his breath . 
According to him , Malfoy seemed determined that he had visualized the sound , pulling his cloak like the others , locking the chest , and , as the train slowed down , it tightened on the shirt . round the neck . 
Harry could see the corridors were full of people and hoped that Hermione and Ron would bring his belongings down to the station ; He was stuck until the carriage was quite empty . 
Finally , with a lap , the train stopped . 
Goyles pulled out the door and put in the crowd for the second year , pushing them aside , Crabbe and Zabini followed . You go ahead , Malfoy says to Pansy , who is waiting for him in the hope of five hands . I just want to check something . Pansy left . 
Now only Harry and Malfoy are in the train . 
People are leaving the station . 
Malfoy goes to the train and pulls the lock so that the corridor can not enter . 
And he pulled the chest out and opened it again . 
Harry peeked down the side of the baggage compartment , his heart beating faster and faster . What did Malfoy want to shred Pansy ? 
Is he planning to see something broken and very important to be healed ? Petrificus Totalus ! [ frozen ] Without warning , Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry , and he stiffened . 
And slowly , he rolls out of his luggage and falls painfully , making the floor clatter , and at Malfoy's feet , the Cloaked Jacket is tucked under his feet , his whole body exposed to his legs . still kneeling in the letter before . 
He could not even move a muscle , he just stared at Mafloy , who was smiling brightly . I thought so , he said jubilantly , I heard Goyle's chest hit you . 
And I thought I saw white light through the air after Zabini came back .... His eyes stopped on Harry's shoes . You do not hear anything I'm interested in , Potter . 
But when he made you here .. And he hit Harry hard . 
Harry saw his nose broke , blood shot everywhere . that's for my dad . 
Now , let's see ... Malfoy pulled the cloak from his immobile body and covered it over his body . I did not expect them to see you until the ship returned to London , saying slowly . Look around you , Potter . And stomping on Harry's fingers , Malfoy left the cabin . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 8 Snape wins 
Harry lies undisturbed beneath the Invisibility T - shirt , who hears the hot blood flowing from his nose to his face , listening to the voice and footsteps outside the corridor . 
He immediately thought that someone would come to inspect the hulls before the ship rolled back . 
But immediately it was depressed that even if anyone looked at the chamber , it could not hear it . 
Fortunately , somebody else will walk into the train and step on it . 
Harry had never hated Malfoy so much when he lay there , like a silly turtle with his back , blood running through his mouth . 
What a stupid situation and the last steps are far away , people walk along the dark station outside ; He could hear the scissors pulling up the swagger and the noisy bibles . 
Ron and Hermione would have thought she had left the ship without waiting for them . 
Once they had arrived at Hogwarts and settled in the Great Hall , running up and down Gryffindor's table without finding out , he was sure Harry had been halfway on the train to London . 
He tried to make a noise , even if it was just a hiss , but he could not . 
And then it suddenly remembered that there were some witches , like Dumbledore who did magic without reading the mantra , so he tried to mumble the spell in his head . He called the wand to summon the wand that had dropped , But nothing happened . 
It sounded like the sound of a rustle of trees around the lake with the sound of a whisper , but no one was looking for anything or even ( it was a little bit of self - aggrandizement for this hope ) . where . 
A sense of hopelessness envelops it as it imagines the carriages pulled by school dragons and the giggles of Malfoy's carriage , where it recounts its attack on the Crabbe , Goyle , Zabini and Pansy Parkinson . 
The train wobbled Harry to one side . 
Now he was staring at the dirt under the seat instead of looking at the ceiling just like that . 
The deck begins to vibrate when the engine explodes . 
The Speed ​​ Train is rolling without anyone knowing it is still there . Then he senses the cloak is up and his voice , Harry , Harry A red light flashes and Harry's body runs out . stiffness ; He was able to sit up more comfortably , catching blood on his face , and raised his head to see Tonks , who was holding the invisibility cloak . We should get out of here , hurry , she said , out of the steaming window and the train began to leave the station . Mau , I jump ship . Harry hurried her along the corridor . 
She pulled the carriage door and jumped down the platform as she slid under as the ship accelerated . 
He jumped , staggered slightly as he landed and straightened up just in time to see the red wagon head through the bend out of sight . 
The cold night was blowing through Harry's throbbing nose . 
Tonks looking at it ; Harry felt anger and embarrassment when he was discovered in a state of sillyness . 
She gave him the invisibility cloak . Who does that ? ' Draco Malfoy bitterly , Harry , thank you . 
Throughout the night , Harry saw that she still had graying hair and miserable looks as she had first met her at the Burrow . I can heal my nose if I stand still . Harry did not like the idea very much ; he was planning to go to see Mrs. Pomfrey , the school nurse , whom he believed in more healing spells , but said it was rude , so it remained unmoving . and close your eyes . Espikey Tonks 
Harry saw his nose hot and then suddenly cold . 
Harry raised his hand slightly . 
It seems healed . Thanks , Madam ! 
You should wear the invisibility cloak and we walk back to school , Miss Tonks said , still do not laugh their lips . 
When Harry put on his shirt , Miss Tonks waved from his wand to a silver , white , four - footed creature in the dark . A Patron Saint ? Harry asked , he had seen Dumbledore send such a message . Yes , I sent the message found the child so people do not worry . 
Stop , I should not be here . Two people go to the trail leading to the school . 
Why did you find me ? I noticed you did not leave the ship and I know you have an invisibility cloak . 
I think you want to hide in it . 
When we see the canopy window collapsed , we think we should go see . But what is your job here ? We are now located in Hogsmeade to enhance the protection , said Tonks . Only you are here or - ? No , there are both Proudfoot , Savage and Dawlish . Dawlish , the God of Light that Mr. Dumbledore attacked last year ? That's right . The two men walked in the night with the new car trails on the deserted road . 
Harry glances at Tonks through his invisibility cloak , and last year his neck was curious ( sometimes a bit too curious ) , always laughing at ease , now looking older , more serious , and more assertive . . 
Is the impact of what happened at the Ministry of Magic ? 
He recalls that Hermione would have advised Harry to say her comforting words , that Sirius's death was not at fault in his neck , but he found it difficult to open his mouth . 
For a long time she had blamed Tonks for Sirius ' death ; She has no faults with others ( but is less faultful than herself ) , but it avoids mentioning Sirius if possible . 
So the two of them quietly went to the school , her tunic Tonks swept behind . 
He always came to school with a tractor , and Harry never expected to see how far Hogsmeade was from the school . 
Finally , she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the tall pillars with wingspan on either side of the school gate . 
He was both cold and hungry and would soon say goodbye to this unhappy Tonks . 
But when he raised his hand he pushed it open . Alohomora opened ! Harry reads the mantra while pointing his wand into the lock , but it remains . That can not be used here , Miss Tonks said , Dumbledore spit on it . Harry looked around and said he could climb the wall himself . 
No , no , Tonks's tone was definitive , all with invincible charms . 
Summer has been tight security hundreds of times . Just then , Harry began to feel frustrated by her indifference , so I was only able to sleep outside this morning . Anyone come out to welcome you . 
Look ! Get off at the foot of the castle and see the lantern covered . 
Harry was so excited that he could even bear the sarcasm of Filch as well as his ranting about using a thumb twist to reinforce the discipline of the school . 
It was not until three or four meters , and Harry took off his invisibility cloak , that he became disillusioned with Severus Snape's long , curly black hair . Ha , snape , Snape smirked as he knocked his wand on the lock so the chain slipped and the gate opened . Appearing is kind , Potter , though it is obvious that the school uniform is bad for the appearance of the game . 
I can not change my clothes , I do not - Harry apologized but Snape interrupted it . No need to wait , Nymphadora , I should have watched the aha - safe of Potter . I texted Hagrid , Tonks scowl . Hagrid was late at the party , like Potter , so we went . 
And by the way , Mr. Snape said as he gave Harry directions through the gate , and I wanted to see his new guardian spirit . He slammed the door in front of Tonks and used the wand as before . I think the old one is better for her , his voice out to see clearly , her new Guard god looks weak . As Snape waved his lanterns in , Harry caught a glimpse of shock and anger on Tonks face . 
Then she went out at night . Greeting her , Harry said as he began to follow Snape . Thank you for everything . See you later , Harry . Snape's teacher was silent for a minute . 
Harry saw his body seem to emit so violent anger that it was hard to believe if Snape did not feel the burning of them . 
He had hated Snape the first time , but by his attitude to Sirius , Harry could never forgive him forever . 
Despite what Dumbledore had said , Harry had thought over the summer , and came to the conclusion that the cynical remarks on Sirius still escaped safe while the rest of the Order The king who fights against Voldemort may be a factor in urging Sirius to break into the Ministry of Magic the night he was killed . 
Harry clung to this thought , because it could have blamed Snape on his head , and it was well worth it , and also because Harry knew that if someone did not feel sorry for Sirius then that was the man . he is walking beside it now . 
Except for the Gryffindor House 50 points late , Snape said , and see , another 20 points , for still wearing Muggle dresses . 
You know , before now we have never seen any House early negative scores in the beginning of this semester : we have not finished dessert . 
Potter , set the record already . Anger and hatred burned inside Harry as if it were hot red , but it would have been better to lie on the train to London than to explain to Snape why it was late . I guess you want to be the protagonist , right ? Snape went on and with no car flying , it was decided that tattoos going into the main hall between the parties would have made the stage effective . Harry remained silent , though he felt the rib cage wanted to explode . 
He knew Snape was looking for this moment , for a few minutes he could see and torture Harry without being heard . 
Finally , up the stairs to the castle and the great oak doors open up a large chapel hall , laughter and a cup of coffee as welcoming the two entered the hall . 
Harry wondered if the invisibility cloak would come back , so that he would go to his seat in the Gryffindor hut ( unfortunately , the table was the farthest from the door ) without any notice . 
Like a clog in Harry's stomach , Snape said , do not wear invisibility cloak . 
Games can go in for people to admire , as we see is the right idea . Harry turned his heel and strode through : for as long as he could escape Snape . 
The main hall with four long tables with the professor's desk at the top of the hall , decked out as usual with candles making the discs shine brightly . 
But for Harry , it was only a blur of light as she strode so fast that she passed Hufflepuff before everyone could see , and as they stood up to look at it , Harry spat at Ron and Hermione , He quickly walked along the table and jumped in between the two . You were - oh - what was your face ? Asked Ron , eyes wide with those sitting nearby . Why , why ? Said Harry , grabbing a spoon and glancing at the distorted face . Your face is full of blood ! Harry yelled . Come here - She waved her wand and shouted Tergeo ! to suck dry blood . Thanks , Harry touched his smooth face . How does my nose look ? Normally , Hermione's voice was worried , Why ? 
Harry , what's up ? 
We are afraid of death ! I tell you later , Harry said curtly . 
It was clear that Ginny , Neville Dean and Seamus were listening ; Even Nick's Head - to - Head , Gryffindor's ghost also came over to overhear . But - Hermione speaks . 
At other times , Hermione , Harry said irritably . 
It was very hopeful that they would think it had something to do with heroes , such as encountering a Death Eater or a Dementor . 
Of course , Malfoy exaggerated the story to as many people as possible , but also the chance of not reaching the ears of so many Gryffindors . 
He reached for Ron's thighs and grabbed a handful of fried potatoes , but the food was gone and replaced with desserts . Anyway , you missed the sorting ceremony Hermione said while Ron grabbed the big chocolate chip cookie . What does the hat say ? Harry took a piece of jam . Actually , as before , it is advisable to unite against the enemy , you know . Did Dumbledore mention Voldemort ? Not yet , do not you always give special speech to the end of the party ? 
It's about time . Snape asked Hagrid to come late - Did you meet him ? 
How to meet ? Asked Ron , his mouth full of cakes . Then hit the head , Harry drift . Uncle Hagrid was only two minutes late , Hermione said , Behold , he waved to you , Harry . Harry looked up at the professor's desk and smiled at Hagrid , who was waving at him . 
Hagrid never looked in harmony with the facade of Professor McGonagall , the Gryffindor House Chair , whose head was just high up between Hagrid's elbows and shoulders as they sat next to each other . applauded the bustling reception of this noisy . 
Harry was surprised to see the teacher of the Prophet , Professor Trelawney sitting across from Hagrid ; she rarely left the office of the neck ; Harry had never seen his neck at school . 
She was still as weird as she was , sparkling beads and long dresses on her , her eyes widening through the glass of her eyes . 
Whenever she thinks she's a fake , Harry was shocked to find out at the end of the semester that she was the one who made the prophecy that caused Voldemort to kill Harry's parents . and attacked Harry himself . 
This discovery makes it even less interesting to her and , thankfully , this school year it will not have to study the Prophet . 
Her eyes were bright as her headlights turned toward him ; He turned to look at the other side of the Slytherin hut . 
Draco Malfoy gestured for a broken nose to break out a burst of laughter and applause . 
Harry looked at the piece of cake , in his stomach boiling . 
He dares to give anything to one with one guy 
Malfoy What does Professor Slughorn want ? Asked Hermione . Want to know what really happened at the Ministry of Magic . Said Harry . He and the crowd here , Hermione snorted . They're like asking us that on the train , right Ron ? Oh right , Ron said , all want to know if you are the One - Picked up - Even the ghosts have talked about this subject , Nick Nearly - Loss - head interrupted , tilted Harry with His head was almost out of place making it look horrible on the collar . They see us as the spokesperson for Harry , who knows our close friendship . 
However , we have confirmed to the community that we will never harass Potter to get information . ' Harry Potter knows he can trust me , ' I told them . ' I would rather die than support his faith . " Not very impressed , if you know that he's been dead for a long time , Ron let loose a sentence . Again , talking to him like a buffalo , Nick responded in a humiliated voice and flew over to the other end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore stood up . 
The noise around Harry almost stopped . My warmest greeting , all laughed out loud , arms wide as if to embrace the whole room . How Hermione gasped . 
She was not the only one who noticed that . 
Dumbledore's right hand was black and dead - looking like the night he'd been to Harry at the Dursleys . 
The whisper rose in the room , Dumbledore understood exactly what everyone else was saying , just laughing and pulling his yellow sleeve over his face . No worries , teachers say , Now the new game , welcome the children , the old game , welcome back ! 
A magical year is waiting for the children Harry whispered into Hermione's ear , his teacher looked like the last time he met . 
I thought he was healing , or asked Mrs. Pomfrey . As if dead skin , Hermione winced . But there are some wounds you can not cure all the ancient curses and those that do not have antidote , and Filch , the curator , asks for a ban on all the items bought at the hoax . the Weasley brothers . Any player who wants to participate in Quidditch for their home team will register the name of the homeroom teacher as usual . 
We also need a new commentator , who wants to also register . 
We are pleased to welcome a new Professor of the Year , Professor Slughorn - Mr. Slughorn to stand up with a glossy bald head under candlelight , his belly shiny on the table - is a former colleague of mine before and agreed to teach poison . Poison ? toxin ? These words flickered back and forth throughout the room when people asked each other whether they heard wrong . Drug poisoning ? Ron and Hermione look around at Harry , but you say - and Professor Snape , Dumbledore , whispering over the room , takes charge of Dark Magic . Are not ! Harry was so big that many turned to look at it . 
It ignores ; eyes staring at the desk teacher , anger . 
How could Snape have been given the Dark Magic Prevention after all ? 
Not everyone knows 
How many years did Dumbledore trust that assignment to him ? But Harry , do you remember telling Mr. Slughorn to teach the Dark Knight ? Asked Hermione . I thought too , Harry scratched his head to remember when Dumbledore was saying that , but now he realized that it seemed Dumbledore had never said anything about the subject that Slughorn would teach . 
Snape , who was sitting at Dumbledore's right , did not stand up to greet him when he heard the name ; He just ignored the Slytherine clapping hands , but Harry bet that there was a triumph out of the person he hated extremely . But there are good things , Harry said malicious voice , this year he will have to pack . Is that Harry ? Asked Ron . This is a story . 
No one taught more than a year that Mr. Quirrell even lost his life when teaching his parents would pray for one more death Harry ! Hermione said in surprise and criticism . Or he simply returned to poison at the end of the year , Ron concludes . Slughorn would not want to stay long . 
Brother Moody is the same . Dumbledore , Harry Ron and Hermione are not the only ones , but the whole hall is also screaming at the fact that Snape is finally getting his wish . 
Seemingly ignoring the hotness of the news that he had uttered , Dumbledore did not comment further on the appointment of the teacher , but he stopped short of waiting for the noise to settle down completely . Now , as everyone knows , Lord Voldemort and his men once again expanded . The room seemed to stretch as he spoke . 
Harry glanced at Malfoy , who was now using his wand hanging from the fork in the air as if Dumbledore's words were not worth his attention . We can not emphasize the danger in the present situation , as well as the prudent level to keep us safe at Hogwarts . 
The magic in the castle has been reinforced , we are protected by new and strong measures but we must also be careful to prevent someone's carelessness in us . 
So we expect the game to comply with all security restrictions , no matter how frustrating the game is - and in particular obey the law not to be out late . 
I also recommend that if you have a strange or suspicious person in or out of the castle , tell the teacher immediately . 
I always believe that you will behave properly for the safety of yourself and others . Dumbledore looked at the students one by one and smiled . For now , a warm mattress is waiting for you and we know that priority is to take a break to prepare for tomorrow morning . 
Then all good night , pip pip ! With a familiar shriek of noise , the rows of benches backed up and hundreds of students flushed out of the hall to their dormitories . 
Harry did not want to come near Malfoy so he mimicked the story of the broken nose , lingering behind , pretending to tie the shoelaces , waiting for all of them to come out of the hall . 
Hermione had to go ahead to lead the bridegroom , and Ron stayed with Harry . Honestly , what is your nose ? Ron asked as they fell behind the crowd and were not overheard . 
Harry told him about it and Ron's not laughing at the results proved their friendship . I see Malfoy pretending to do something with his nose , Ron said sadly . 
All right , Harry said bitterly , I overheard what he said before he found out that Harry was expecting Ron to be surprised by Malfoy's bragging rights . 
Ron , however , is still in the limelight , which Harry attributed to his stubbornness . Come on , Harry , he's just pretending to be Parkinson . Who - knows - what - knows - what - he - can - do ? How can you be sure that Voldemort does not need a hand at Hogwarts ? 
It's not the first time - I hope you stop saying that name , Harry , a blamed voice behind them . 
Harry looked back and saw Hagrid shaking his head . Dumbledore called that name , Harry argued . Ah , it's because you're Dumbledore , are not you ? Hagrid spoke in a mysterious voice . Why are you so late , Harry , are you worried ? I was stuck on the train , Harry replied . Why are you late ? I have to worry about Grawp , Hagrid gladly replied . Take time . 
Now it has a new house on the mountain - Dumbledore fixed it - a beautiful cave . 
He was happier when he was in the forest . 
My brothers can talk well . So ? Harry said without looking at Ron ; The last time he met Hagrid's half - sister , a fierce giant who spat on the tree , the word boy was just five words and two words were not pronounced . Damn it , it's great progress , Hagrid's proud . We will be surprised to see . 
I'm thinking of training it as my assistant . Ron snorted loudly but tried to make a sharp sneeze . 
They were coming out of the oak door . What , see you on the first day , after lunch tomorrow . Come early to say hello to Buck - I mean , Witherwings ! With a cheerful hug , Hagrid stepped out . 
Harry and Ron looked at each other . Harry could have guessed the guy's mood was just like his . Do you take Care of the occult ? Ron shook his head , also did you ? And Hermione , Ron said , did not he also learn ? Harry shook his head again . 
Harry did not dare to think exactly what Hagrid would say when he noticed that his three pupils did not study the subject anymore . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 9 Prince of Hybrids 
Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast . 
Harry quickly tells Hermione what he hears from Malfoy on the Hogwarts Express , hoping his hypothesis is more supportive . But obviously Malfoy just wanted to show off to Parkinson , Ron quickly interrupted , before Hermione said anything . I do not know . It looks like Malfoy is doing a great job , but how can he lie about such a big deal ? Well , Harry replied , but he can not emphasize more opinions . Because there are so many people trying to hear it , not to mention staring at it and shaking hands whispering to each other . 
Hey , pointing that out is rude , Ron bullied a little boy first 
When they lined up , they climbed out of the portrait hole . 
He was whispering something about Harry to his friend , immediately blushing and panicked out of the hole . 
Ron laughs , I like being a sixth year student . 
This year we will have a lot of free time . 
There are many classes I just entertain . We will need those moments to study the song , Ron , Hermione said as they walked down the corridor . Oh , but today , no , Ron said , I think today will rest for now . Just drill , Hermione spread her arms and blocked a fourth - year student trying to pass her , clutching a blue disk . Spoiled Spoilers are prohibited . give it to me ! She said sternly . 
The little boy scowled at a plate that was snarling , then ran through her hands and walked away with her friends . 
Ron waited until he was gone and grabbed the flying saucer from Hermione's hand . Great , I always like something like this . Hermione's protest was sank by a large chuckle : it was obvious that Lavender Brown found Ron's remark very interesting . 
She continued to laugh as she passed them , glaring at Ron over her shoulder . 
Ron looks pretty satisfied with himself . 
The pavilions in the Hall today are blue , dotting the thin clouds , as if we were looking at the sky through the bars in the headline . 
As they were eating porridge , eggs and salted meats , Harry and Ron told Hermione a troublesome conversation with Hagrid last night . But he can not think that we will continue to study the mysterious Creature Care , she said worriedly . I mean , have you ever known that , show any enthusiasm ? That is the problem , right ? , Said Ron while swallowing the fried egg . In the class we are the ones who try hard the most because of Hagrid . 
But he thinks we like this stupid subject . 
Do you have any children who will continue to N . E . T . Neither Harry nor Hermione answered ; no need to answer . 
They knew that this year the class would not have any students in the care of mysterious creatures . 
They avoided Hagrid's gaze and were not happy to respond to Hagrid's wave as he left the teacher's desk 10 minutes later . 
After they had finished eating , the rest of the group stayed with Professor McGonagall from the teacher's desk . 
Scheduling this year is more complicated than usual , as Professor McGonagall first needs to confirm that all students have achieved the Ordinary Wizarding Level ( OWL ) needed to continue . Study selected NEWT classes . ( Hic , in case readers forget : 3 points in the O . W . L exam from high to low are : Outstanding , Exceed Expectations and Acceptable . 
Hermione was immediately admitted to the Charms , Prevention of Dark Arts , Transfiguration , Herbalism , Numerology , Runes , Ancients , and without further trouble , she sprang up . Go to school to learn the ancient language Runes . 
Neville took more time , his round face seemed worried as Professor McGonagall looked down at the subject register and saw his O . W . L score . Herbal medicine , good . 
She said . Professor Sprout would be happy to see her return to school with the O . W . L ' Excellence ' score . 
And your child is eligible for Black Hawk Prevention when scoring an ' Over Expectation ' . 
But the problem is the Transform class . 
She regretted Longbottom and , but the Acceptance score was not enough for her to continue to N . E . T . T . 
She thought she could not follow the lecture . 
Neville bowed . 
Professor McGonagall looked at him squarely . But why would you like to study Transfiguration class ? 
She does not feel like she really likes this . 
Neville looked miserable and muttered something about what she wanted . Hmm , Professor McGonagall snorted . It's time for my grandmother to learn to be proud of her grandchild , but not the one she wants - especially after what happened at the Ministry . Neville blushed and blinked ; Professor McGonagall never complimented him . Longbottom , she's sorry , but she can not let her child into her N . E . T . T class . 
However , she found that she had exceeded her expectations for Charms . 
Why do not you try the N . E . t . You think it's too much , Neville murmured . Studying the Spell , Professor McGonagall said , And she will write a few lines for Augusta to remind her grandmother that because she had also slipped the Spellbook O . W . L , this subject is not necessarily useless . And smiling at the skepticism but contented on Neville's face , Professor McGonagall tapped the chopsticks on the blank white calendar and handed it to Neville , who now showed the details of the class . 
Professor McGonagall turned to Parvati Patil , whose first question was whether Firenze , the handsome young man , would continue to teach the Prophet . Mr. Firenze and Ms . Trelawney will divide the class this year to teach , Professor McGonagall said with disdain ; Everyone knows that she despised the Prophet . Year 6 students will be taught by Ms . Trelawney . 
Five minutes later , Parvati went to study the Prophet's class , which looked like a retreat . Then , to Potter , Potter Professor McGonagall reviewed her papers when turning to Harry . Charms , Prevention of black art , Herbal medicine , Transfiguration good . 
You have to say , she's satisfied with her Transfiguration , Potter , very pleased . 
See , why did not you register for the poison class ? 
Do you think you have the ambition to be the god of light ? Yes , but , Professor , you said that you need to score O . W . L Excellent to learn again . That is when Professor Snape taught this subject . 
In contrast , Professor Slughorn is very willing to accept students who have exceeded expectations . 
Do you want to study medicine ? Yes , but you do not buy books , materials or anything . I'm sure Professor Slughorn could lend me some money , Professor McGonagall said . Very good , Potter , this is your child's schedule . 
Oh , by the way , twenty students hoping to play for the Gryffindor Quidditch team have registered their names . 
She will transfer the list to her at the right time , and she can arrange some tests when she is free . A few minutes later , Ron was finished with the same subjects as Harry , and they both left the table . Look , Ron said cheerfully , staring at the schedule , now we have a class , a lesson after lunch , after lunch . 
They returned to the common room , only about six of them in the seventh year , including Katie Bell , the only remaining member of the original Quidditch team that Harry had joined since the first year . 
I think I ' ll be fine , she exclaimed , pointing at the captain's badge on Harry's chest . Remember to call me when you organize the test offline . Do not be stupid , Harry replied , you need to check again . 
I have watched you play for 5 years . 
Not to start with that , Katie said warily . I know there are better players than you . If the captain continues to believe in the old faces , or relies on Ron's friends , he looks a bit uncomfortable and starts playing with Hermione's Flying Toe plate from him . 4 th year . 
He fumbled around the room , snarling and trying to bite the embroidered carpet . 
The Crookshanks ' yellow eyes followed the flying saucer and the cat hissed as it came too close . 
An hour later , the two reluctantly left the living room in the sun to attend the Anti - Artistic Studio under the four floors . 
Hermione had been waiting outside , arms full of heavy books and looked exhausted . I have a lot of anti - Runes , she said anxiously with Harry and Ron . A 15 - inch essay , two translations , and I had to read the whole stack before Wednesday . Shame , Ron yawned . Wait , Hermione replied irritably . I bet Snape will give you a whole bunch of exercises . The classroom door opened as she spoke , and Snape stepped out into the corridor , his pale yellow face framed between two dark gray strips of hair . 
The students immediately silent . Come inside , Snape said . 
Harry looked around as they entered . 
Mr. Snape left his own mark on the room , it looked bleaker than usual , the curtains covered the window , the room was lit by the candles . 
Many new paintings are hung on the wall , most of which are suffering people , severe sports injuries or body parts that are oddly distorted . 
Nobody said anything when they sat down , looking around the dark murals . I never told you to take the book , Snape said , closing the door and stepping from his desk to face the whole class . 
Hermione rushed past her with an anonymous look on her briefcase , tucking it under her chair . I want to tell you something , and I want you to pay attention . 
Snape's black eyes flickered across the faces that were rising , pausing a little longer at Harry . Up to now , there have been 5 teachers teaching this subject , I think . Thinking like he did not see all of them coming and going , hoping to be the next one , Harry thought contemptuously . Of course , these teachers have their own teaching methods and priorities . 
In such a state of confusion we are amazed at how many games can still be traced to a degree in this subject . 
I would be even more surprised if all the games that follow N . E . T . T are much more advanced . 
Snape walked around the room , lowering his voice now . 
The class reached out to see him clearly . 
Dark art , Snape continues , there are many , varied , ever - changing and everlasting . 
Fighting them is like fighting a monster with many heads , which , when a head is destroyed , a new , more terrible and wiser than before . 
The game is against something that is not fixed , always changing and can not be destroyed . Harry stared at Snape . 
Of course , to respect dark art as a dangerous enemy , but the way Snape was talking , seemed to caress the voice in his voice ? Their defense , Snape said a little louder , so be flexible and creative as well as dark art that you are fighting against . 
These paintings - Snape pointing at a few paintings as they pass through them - clearly show what happened to those , for example , under torture - he waved to a witch screaming in pain - dazzled by a dementor - with a pair of empty eyes sinking down against a wall - or provoking an attack by an Inferius ( ie , a corpse ) . a bloody block on the ground . Has anyone seen Inferius yet ? Parvatil Patil asked in a very high voice . 
Have 
Is he going to use them ? Dark Lord has used Inferius in the past , says Snape , meaning that he should know he can use them again . 
Now Snape went round the classroom to get back to his desk , and once again , the students looked at Snape as the black cloak rolled up behind him . I believe that you do not know how to use the mantras without speaking words . 
What is the advantage of saying no words ? Hermione's arms straight up . 
Snape also took a moment to look at everyone else , until there was no one else to say curtly : Well , Miss Granger ? Your opponent will not know what magic you are doing , says Hermione , giving you an advantage less than a second . This answer copies almost every word in the popular Magic Book , Grade 6 , Mr. Snape says harshly ( in the corner of the room , Malfoy smiles ) - but basically . 
Yes , those who have the ability to use spells without uttering a spell will have a bit of astonishment when doing magic . 
Of course , this is a matter of concentration and mental strength , and some people - once again Snape's malicious look pointed at Harry - is missing . 
Harry knew that Snape was thinking of the disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year . 
He kept staring at him , even scowling until Snape turned away . The game will split - Snape continues - into pairs . 
One will try the other's spell without speaking . 
The other will try to resist the curse in the same silence . 
Go ahead . Although Snape did not know , Harry taught at least half the students in the class ( all of whom had been members of the Defense Association ) , using the Shield Shield last year . 
However , none of them ever uttered spells without having to speak . 
There are quite a few tricks that have happened , many people just whisper mantras instead of saying aloud . 
Yet just ten minutes after the beginning of the lesson , without a word , Hermione was able to fight Jelly Legs Jinx , which Neville was whispering , a feat that would have been a cult . Anybody fair enough will give the Gryffindor 20 points - Harry bitterly thought - but Snape ignored it . 
He glanced at them as they practiced , more like a bat than ever , lingering for Harry and Ron to wrestle with the exercise . 
Ron , Harry must be sorcery , purple face , lips tight to prevent the temptation to utter the mantra . 
Harry lifted his wand , waiting impatiently to stop the curse from appearing . Usual , Weasley , after Snape said . Here , let's just show him he just wanded at Harry so fast he just reacted instinctively , forgetting all the thoughts about the unspoken mantra . 
It screamed : Protego . 
Harry's Shield is so strong that Master Snape leaned over and hit the table . 
The class looks around and now sees Snape regaining his balance , scowling . Potter , do you remember telling the practice of the spell do not say words ? Yes , Harry replied firmly . Yes , sir . No need to call your child ' teacher ' , professor . The words came out of Harry's mouth before he understood what he was saying . 
Some people gasped , including Hermione . 
However , Snape , Ron , Dean and Seamus are grinning . ( Laughs , Sunday night , my office , Snape says , I do not accept anyone's confusion , Potter , even ' Picky ' . ) Awesome , Harry . . 
Ron laughed when they were safe for a while . Actually you should not say that , Hermione said , frowning at Ron . What made you try to curse me ( jinx ? ) I , you do not mind , Harry was angry . I have had enough of such things in Occlumency lessons . 
Why did not he change a different animal ? 
Did not know what Dumbledore was going to do to allow him to teach Dark Arts Defense ? 
What did you hear about Black Art ? 
He loved them , all unidentified tangle , not destroyed it Oh , Hermione said , I think he said it looks a bit like you . Like me ? Yes , when you tell us how to face Voldemort . 
You say not to remember a pile of magic is okay , you say it is your problem , intelligence , courage Not what the teacher said Snape ? 
Is it important to be brave and think fast ? Harry exasperated when she saw that every word of her was as memorable as the Book of Common Scribes , so it was no longer controversial . Harry ! 
Hey Harry ! Harry looked around ; Jack Sloper , one of the Gryffindor Players last year , rushed forward , holding a roll of parchment . Yours , Sloper panting . I heard you are the new captain . 
When do you plan to hold auditions ? I'm not sure yet . Harry said , thinking that Sloper would be lucky to be in the team this time . 
Will tell you later . Okay , I hope this week ... But Harry did not hear anymore , he recognized the slant , the piece on the roll . 
Leaving Sloper's mouth , he runs toward Ron and Hermione , opens the paper roll . Dear Harry , I want you to start private lessons this Saturday . 
Please come to my office at 8 pm . 
I hope to return to school happily . 
Dear , Albus Dumbledore PS : I like Lemon Candy . Do you like Lemon Candy ? Ron read the letter over Harry's shoulder and looked confused . It was the password to go through the gutter outside of his office , Harry lowered his voice . Ha , Snape will not be happy . 
I will not be able to carry out his restraining order . Harry , Ron , and Hermione spent the rest of their break to guess what Dumbledore would teach Harry . 
Ron thought that it would be the curse and the spectacular spell that the Death Eaters had not known . 
Hermione said it was illegal , and suggested that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry about the Dark Arts Prevention . 
After the break , she goes to Numeric while Harry and Ron return to the common room and reluctantly sit down to do Snape's homework . 
It turned out that the exercises were so complex that they were still unfinished when Hermione joined the rest of the group after lunch ( although she helped make the task a lot quicker ) . 
The crowd just finished when the bell rang , and two days after the poison began , and they walked on the familiar path leading to the classroom , which had long since been occupied by Snape . 
When they came to the corridor , they found that only a dozen students attended N . E . T . T . 
Crabbe and Goyle clearly did not reach the required O . W . L score , but had four children 
Slytherins continued to study , including Malfoy . 
There are four Ravenclaws , a Hufflepuff , Ernie Macmillan , whom Harry likes despite his autobiography . Harry , Ernie said this way , holding out Harry's hand . 
There was no chance to talk during the Black Martial Arts prevention session this morning . 
I think it's a good lesson , but the Shield is a little old , of course , with the members D . And we Ron , Hermione , how are you ? Before they could say anything more than Good , the door opened , and Slughorn's belly appeared before him . 
As the students entered the cellar , Slughorn's whiskers curled up on the grin , and he greeted Harry and Zabini particularly warmly . 
The basement , very unusual , filled with steam and strange odors . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione snorted as they passed through the big cauldrons . 
The four Slytherins sat at one table , the four Ravenclaws too . 
So there was only Harry , Ron and Hermione together with Ernie . 
They picked up near a yellow cauldron that smelled the most seductive smell Harry had ever smelled . 
For some reason , it reminded Harry of the treacle tart , the woody scent of the broomstick , and the floral scent that Harry remembered had smelled at the Burrow Farm . 
Harry found himself breathing very slowly and deeply , and the scent of the drug seemed to permeate it as wine . 
A very satisfying feeling for Harry ; He grinned at Ron , who was laughing a little too lazy . Now , now , now , Slughorn says , his massive figure shakes in the dim light . Get out , everyone , other necessities , and do not forget to make a high grade book . What , Harry , my boy ? I have no books , no weight or anything - Ron did not have - before we did not know we could be in NEWT class , you see . Well , Professor McGonagall mentioned , do not worry , My love , do not worry . 
Today you can use the materials in your closet , and I'm sure you can lend me some scales , a small bookstore is also available here , you can use until you write a letter . Flourish and Blotts Slughorn strode to the closet in the corner , and after a moment's search , appeared with two of Libatius Borage's " Advanced Makeup , " which looked very old , giving Ron and Harry the same . with two dulled scales . Now , Mr. Slughorn was back in front of the class , breathing in his chest that had soared so much that his tunic wanted to break , I prepared some medicine for the games , externally Take a little practice this is what you will have to do after finishing the NEWT class . 
The games must have heard of them , though they have not tried . 
Who can tell you what this is ? He pointed to the cauldron near the Slytherins table . 
Harry moved a bit up and saw something like normal boiling water . 
Hermione's maneuvered hands shot in front of everyone , Slughorn pointed at her . It's a liquid , colorless , odorless liquid that can force the drinker to tell the truth , Hermione said . Very good , very good , Mr. Slughorn said pleased . Now , he continued , pointing to the cauldron near the Ravenclaws table , which is quite well known here , was introduced in the recent publications of the Ministry of Magic Who can ? Hermione's hand raised again the fastest . That teacher is a multi - drug , she replied . 
Harry also realized the muddy liquid that was boiling slowly in the second cauldron . 
But it does not bother Hermione to answer the question . 
After all , it is she who successfully blended in her second year . Excellent , excellent ! 
Now , what about this one , Slughorn said , surprised to see Hermione's arm again . that is the Pharmacy . Yes . 
It seems a bit silly to ask this question , Slughorn looks incredibly shocked , but I think I know what it's for . It is the strongest love drug in the world , said Hermione . Exactly ! 
I think you recognize it through its distinctive pearl glitter ? As the water vaporized into typical whirlpools , Hermione eagerly said , moreover , different people would smell different flavors depending on what we liked . 
You can smell new grass , new parchment and suddenly she blushed and did not say anymore . 
Can you name me ? Slughorn said , ignoring Hermione's embarrassment . My teacher is Hermione Granger . Granger ? Granger ? What is the relative of Hector Dagworth - Granger , who founded the ' Society of Frequent Dispensers ' ? I do not think so teacher . 
Harry and Muggle look at Malfoy leaning toward Nott and whispering something , both of them laughing , but Slughorn does not look disappointed . 
On the contrary , he laughed and looked from Hermione to Harry , who was sitting next to her . A ha ! ' One of my best friends was born in the Muggle family , and she was the best student of ours . ' 
Is this a friend you say no Harry ? Yes , sir . Oh , 20 points worth the Gryffindor , Granger , Slughorn kindly said . 
Malfoy looks as if Hermione smacks a fruit in her face . 
Hermione turned to Harry and whispered , Did you tell your teacher the best thing about the course ? 
Oh Harry ! What's so impressive about that ? Ron whispered , not knowing why he looked annoyed . You are the best person in the whole course - if you ask me then I say the same . Hermione smiled but signaled ' silence ' , so that all could hear what Slughorn was saying . 
Ron looks rather upset . Of course , Love does not really make love . 
Can not create or imitate love . 
No , this substance causes only a mad fascination . 
Perhaps this is the most dangerous and powerful substance in this room - well , Slughorn said , nodding solemnly at Malfoy and Nott , both of whom were laughing incredulously . When you learn about life as much as you know , you will not dare to underestimate the power of a passionate love ... And now , says Slughorn , is the time we enter . Sir , you have not told us what is in the cauldron , Ernie Macmillan asked , pointing to a small black cauldron in front of Slughorn's desk . 
The liquid in it is bursting with joy ; It has the color of gold smelting , and the big drops are shot like goldfish on the water , though no drops are spilling out . A ha , Slughorn exclaimed again . 
Harry was sure Slughorn had not forgotten this liquid yet , but waited for the students to make a special impression . That's right . 
This liquid , ladies and gentlemen , is the most exotic , Felix Felicis . 
I suppose , the teacher smiled , turning to look at Hermione , who had just uttered a scream , knowing what Felix Felicis was , was not it Granger ? That is the lucky liquid , she said emotionally , it gives us luck . The class seemed more straightforward . 
Now all that Harry could see in Malfoy was behind his sleek blond head , as Malfoy finally focused his attention on Slughorn . Exactly . 
Ten more points for Gryffindor . 
Yes , it is this very tiny liquid stuff that is extremely difficult to prepare , and if done wrong it is extremely harmful . 
However , if properly prepared like this , you will find that all your efforts can be successful at least until the effects of the drug go away . Teacher , why do not people drink it continuously ? Terry Boot asked eagerly . Because if you drink too much it will cause excitement , risk and recklessness . Says Slughorn . Too much , you know that using large doses is very toxic . 
But if you use the savings , sometimes very early you have ever used it ? Asked Michael Corner . Twice in a lifetime , Slughorn said . One time when he was 24 years old , the second time he was 57 years old . 
Two tablespoons full of breakfast . 
Two perfect days . Slughorn gazed into the air , dreaming . 
Whether he plays or not , Harry thought , the effect was also great . And that , Slughorn said , seems to have just returned to the ground , he will be used as a prize for today's class . All so silent that the bubbling bubbling of the surrounding chemicals was tenfold . This little Felix Felicis bottle , taken from a bag of tiny bottles of cork knit in the bag , was raised for the whole class . enough for 12 hours of luck . 
From dawn until late afternoon , you will be lucky to do anything . We must now warn that Felix Felicis is a prohibited substance in any organized competition , such as sporting events , tests , or elections . 
So the winner can only use it for a normal day and see how ordinary that day is . Then , Slughorn said , suddenly agile , how did you win this marvelous prize ? 
By turning to page 10 of the book ' Making Advanced Pesticides ' . 
We have more than an hour left just enough to make a good living Death Death . 
He knew that this drug was more complicated than anything previously tried , and he did not expect a perfect dose from anyone . 
But whoever does the best will be rewarded with this small bottle of Felix . 
Begin ! The razor whistled as all the students pulled their cauldron in front of them , and a few tinkering was loud as everyone started putting the scales on the scales , but no one said anything . 
Easily recognize the concentration in the room . 
Harry saw Malfoy flipping through the pages of the book , ' Making Advanced Cigarettes , ' obviously Malfoy wanted a good day . 
Harry quickly bent down to the brochure Slughorn had lent him . 
Harry was annoyed that the previous owner of the book scrawled across the pages , making the margin of the book as black as print . 
Bending down to read the materials ( including the old owner also brick lung and add notes ) , Harry rushed to the locker to find what it needs . 
As she turned to her cauldron , she saw Malfoy cutting the girl's roots as quickly as she could . 
The class constantly glances at what others are doing ; It is both advantageous and detrimental to the drug , which means that it can not keep its job secret . 
For 10 minutes , the entire room was covered with blue water . 
Hermione , of course , is moving the farthest . 
Her medication was similar to the smooth , dark - colored liquid that the books describe in the middle . 
Finished his roots , Harry looked down again at the book again . 
It is annoying to try to decipher the instructions between the stupid insults of the old owner , who do not know how to disagree with the instructions to cut the sopophorous bean into pieces , and have changed . Another tip : Use a flat silver knife to crush more water than to cut . Teacher , I think you know my grandfather , Abraxas Malfoy ? Harry looked up . 
Slughorn was walking across the Slytherins table . Ừ . Slughorn said , not looking at Malfoy . I am very sorry to hear of his death , though it is inevitable that he is suffering from a dragon pox at his age . Θchicken - pox is chickenpox , What is the Dragon Pox ? 
And he left . 
Harry turned to his cauldron , mockingly laughing . 
It can be seen that Malfoy was expecting to be treated like Harry or Zabini , perhaps even hoping for some sort of incentive like the one he used to get from Snape . 
It seems that Malfoy can not rely on anything other than his own ability to receive a bottle of Felix Felicis . 
Sopophorous beans are very difficult to cut . 
Harry turned to Hermione : Can I borrow a silver knife ? She nodded impatiently , never taking her eyes off her medication , now it is dark purple , though according to the book it should have turned purple mauve . 
Harry crushes his bean with the dagger's plane . 
To its astonishment , the bean sprouts so much water that Harry was amazed at how dry beans could hold so much water . 
Harry hurried into the cauldron , peering over the remnants of the drug immediately turning to the violet purple that the textbook described . 
Harry's exasperation with the previous owner of the book vanished instantly , now squinting at the next line of instructions . 
According to the book , it will have to stir counter - clockwise until the liquid becomes in water . 
But according to what the old owner added , after seven rounds stirred counterclockwise it must stir down once . 
Can the former boss be the second right ? 
Harry pounded anti - clockwise , holding his breath , and stirring once in the afternoon . 
Effective immediately . 
The drug turns pink . How you do that ? Hermione asked , her face flushed red and her hair became more and more messy in the smoke rising from the cauldron , her medicine still in purple . One more clockwise . No , no , the book says counterclockwise , " she replied irritably . 
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing . 
7 reverse rings , 1 reverse , 7 reverse rings , 1 reverse ring . In front of him , Ron is breathing just cursed ; Ron's drug licorice . 
Harry looked around . 
According to what it sees , no drug can turn to its light color . 
Harry was very excited - something that had never happened in the basement before . 
And time is over . 
Slughorn exclaimed . Offer to stop harassment ! Slowly Slughorn moved between tables , peering at the cauldrons . 
He did not make any comment , but occasionally stirred up or smelled them . 
Finally he reached the table where Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ernie were sitting . 
He smiled mischievously at the tar - like drug in Ron's cauldron , passing through the blue water of Ernie . 
Hermione's medicine was appreciated by the teacher . 
Then he saw Harry's medication , and on his face there was a disbelieving skepticism . This is the winner , he screams in the middle of the tunnel . Excellent , excellent , Harry ! 
God , obviously I inherited my mother's talent . 
Yes , Lily is very good at poisoning . Here , a bottle of Felix Felicis as promised , and use it in a useful way . Harry shoved the yellow liquid into his pocket , feeling a strange combination of pleasure in seeing the Slytherins ' angry faces and guilt in front of Hermione's frustrated face . 
Ron was stunned . How you do that ? Ron whispered to Harry as he left the basement . Probably lucky , Harry said , because Malfoy was still around . 
Only when they were at Gryffindor's dinner table did Harry feel safe enough to tell the other two . 
Hermione's face grew colder after every word Harry uttered . I think you think you cheated ? It ends , irritated by Hermione's attitude . Well , that's not exactly your product . she answered stiffly . Harry followed other instructions , Ron said , could lead to disaster , right ? 
But Harry had tried and paid for it well . 
He sighed . The price that Slughorn gave me the book , but no , I received the book that no one wrote anything . Watched until page 52 , but Wait , a voice echoed Harry's left ear , and suddenly he felt the fragrance that had once smelled in Slughorn's cellar . 
He looked around and saw Ginny join in . Did you hear that wrong ? 
Did you follow the instructions that someone wrote in a book ? Harry ? She looked panicked and angry . 
Harry knew what she was thinking . It's okay , he calm down , lowering his voice . It's not like that , you know , Riddle's Diary . 
Just an old textbook that someone has scrawled . But are you doing what he says ? I just tried a few tips written on the edge of the book , really Ginny , no difference , Ginny was right , Hermione replied swiftly . We have to try to see if there is something strange in it . 
These strange instructions , who knows ? Hey , Harry said furiously , as Hermione pulled up the Making of High - End Potion from her pockets and raised her wand . Specialis Revelio ( Let's reveal something special ) , she said , tapping her chopsticks on the cover . 
However , nothing happened . 
The book just lay there , looking old , dirty and curly . Finished yet ? Harry said irritably , or would you like to see him do some acrobatics ? Perhaps it was okay , Hermione replied , still staring at the book suspiciously . I mean , maybe it's really just a textbook . Good . Let me get it back . Harry grabbed the book on the table , but it slipped out of Harry's hand , spreading open on the ground . 
No one cares . 
Harry leaned down to retrieve the book , and as he did so he saw some words scribbled down the back of the book , with hardly read lines as lines instructing Harry to obtain Felix Felicis . hidden in a pair of socks inside Harry's chest upstairs . 
Written : This book is the property of Prince Tu Lai . 
Chapter 10 The Count's House 
The remainder of this week , Harry continues to follow the instructions of the Half - Blood Prince until he escapes the Bibi Libatius , resulting in a fourth lesson . Slughorn is fascinated with the ability of Harry , saying that he rarely taught a talented person like him . Both Ron and Hermione were not happy at all . 
Although Harry had given them both to read , Ron had interpreted the handwriting more difficult than Harry , and he could not help but ask Harry to read it otherwise it would be suspicious . 
Meanwhile , Hermione resolutely continued with what she called the " official " guide , but became fiercer when the result was less than the prince's instructions . 
Harry wondered who the half - blood Prince was . 
Although a large amount of homework has prevented him from reading the Prince's advanced magnifying glass , he has glimpsed enough to look at a page that the prince did not write down , nor did it all . It is related to the preparation . Those are the mantras that appear to have been created by the prince himself . " Or is it her , " Hermione said irritably , when Harry overheard them pointing out to Ron in the living room for Saturday dinner . " I see the writing more like a girl than a boy . " " He's called Half - Blood Prince , " said Harry . " How many girls are princes ? " Hermione had no answer . 
It just scowled and flicked the essay . The materialization principle came from Ron , trying to read from top to bottom . 
Harry looked at his watch and hurried into the pot . " 8 h less 5 , I'm going , I ' ll be late for Dumbledore's death " Ồ " Hermione gasped , looking up " Good luck ! 
We will wait for you , we want to hear what you teach us . "" Hope everything will be fine , " said Ron , and the two looked at Harry through the portrait hole . 
Harry walked away from the corridor , huddled behind the statue as Professor Trelawney appeared at the corners of the corridor , whispering a dirty jumble , as he read . " Two balls : face to face , " she murmured , as she walked past Harry's hiding place , she fell back . 
" Seven Flutes : sickness . 
Children 10 flanges : violence . 
The gentleman , the little one , can be annoying , not interested in the interrogation ... " She stood frozen , just across the statue Harry hid . " This is not right , " she said irritably . said , and Harry heard her shuffling the cards again and again , leaving some smells of xeret cooking . 
Harry waited until she was sure she was gone , and rushed forward until she reached the 7 th floor corridor with a gutter against the wall . 
" Acid explosion , " Harry shouted , the gutter jumped to one side , the back wall split , revealing the rocking staircase , Harry stepped up , it was gently rotated to carry . to the door with a knocking on the door leading to Dumbledore's office . 
Harry knocked on the door , " Come in , " Dumbledore said . 
" Hello , " Harry walked into the principal's room . " Ah , hello , Harry . Sit down , " said the dumbledore , smiling . " I hope you have a good one - week return to school ? " " Yes , thank you , " said Harry . 
" I'm very busy , there's a punishment waiting for me . " " Oh " Harry started clumsy , but Dumbledore did not seem to be serious . 
" I arranged with Snape you will be fine next Saturday . " " That's great , " said Harry , with more urgency than Snape's punishment . Signs to see what Dumbledore would do with this meal . 
This circular office still looks like a silver instrument lying on a table with thin legs like a reed pipe , a cigarette smoke , the portraits of former headmasters drowning Dumbledore's picture frame , and the splendid phoenix , Fawkes , stand on the tree branch at the door , looking at Harry with concern . 
It does not look like Dumbledore is prepared for a duel . 
" Hey Harry , " serious voice , " I'm sure you're wondering what you're going to teach your kids ? " " Yes , " " Well , I decided that this time I should give you some background information . Voldemort tried to kill me 15 years ago . " He paused . 
" At the end of the semester you were about to tell me everything . " It was hard to notice the accusation in his voice . 
It added . 
" Of course I said that , " said Dumbledore calmly . " I told you everything I know . 
From there , we can put aside the main event to travel together to the dark marsh of memories to the wildest bushes of conjecture . Now , Harry , perhaps we also see As sad as Humphrey Belcher , who believes everything has come to maturity . " But do you think you are right ? " Naturally , as I have shown you , I make the mistake of the latter . Indeed - my fault for you - the wiser , the bigger my mistake . " Master , " Harry hesitated . " So you're going to tell me what to do with the prophecy ? 
Does it help me ... to survive ? "" There's a lot to do with prophecy , " said Dumbledore , as coincidentally as Harry asked him about the weather the next day . " I hope so , it will help me survive . " Dumbledore stood up . walking around the desk , across from Harry , who was spinning and turning to watch Dumbledore turn the closet next to the door . 
When he put it back , the toolholder was holding a shallow basin that was familiar with the acidic paintings around the mouth of the pot . 
Put the pots on the table in front of Harry . 
" I'm worried " Harry was really looking at the pot of fear . The previous experience with this strange method of retaining and reviewing thoughts and recollections , though worthwhile , It still feels uncomfortable . 
Last time I used pots 1 , it has seen more than the desire . 
But Dumbledore smiled . 
Of course , unlike before , today I'm allowed . "" Where are we going ? "" Come to Bob Odgen's little lane of recollection . " Dumbledore say , take a bag of crystal from a bag of whitish silver whips . 
" Who is Bob Odgen ? " " He is a member of the Magistrates ' Law Enforcement Division . 
He had been dead for a while , but before that we found him and persuaded him to give us some memories . 
We will accompany him on a mission assignment . If you agree , Harry ... .. .... " But Dumbledore struggled to pull the cork out : his hands were stiff in pain . 
" to you ... to me ? 
"" No problem , Harry , " he said , pointing his wand at the bottle and the knob . 
" Master , are you all right ? " Asked Harry , looking at the black fingers for the mixture . 
" It's time for the story , Harry . 
Finished , we have an appointment with Bob Odgen . " The silver slope in the bottle into the pot , they twist and shimmering , not the liquid but not the gas . " pots . 
Harry stepped forward , inhaling deeply , dipping his face into that silver compound . 
He felt his leg drop off the floor , it fell into the black hole and then completely abruptly , it blinked at the glare of the sun . Before his eyes were controlled , Dumbledore landed on the side . . 
They are standing in a village road adjacent to the fence of tall trees huddled under the blue summer sky like flowing flowers . They are about 10 feet tall , a fat man with thick glasses is thick enough to make him look like a mole . 
He knew it must have been Bob Odgen , the only one in this scene , who was dressed in a very weird outfit , Most of the witches are not experienced in trying to look like Muggles : as in this case , a long gown covers a bathing suit . 
However , before Harry had time to memorize more than that bizarre look , Odgen stepped down the path . 
Dumbledore and Harry followed . 
When crossing the sea , Harry traced two directions . One point in the direction they were from , the Great Hangleton , 5 miles . 
The other side is toward Odgen , Little Hangleton , 1 mile away . 
Two step on the short path to see nothing but the hedge , the sky in front of the face and the robe ruffled in front . 
Then the road turns to the left and leads to the hillside slope , suddenly the valley scene appears before them . 
Harry could see the village , no doubt , this was the Little Hangletry , nestled between the two slopes , seeing both the church and the cemetery . 
Cross the valley , on the opposite hillside is a very beautiful manor surrounded by a wide strip of blue velvet grass . 
Ogden hurried down the ramp . 
Dumbledore stepped out , Harry had to rush to catch up . 
He did not know if this Hangleton was the final destination , and he wondered in the evening to find Slughorn , why they had to be close to such a distance . 
However , he quickly realized that it was mistaken to think that they were heading towards the village . 
The path turns to the right , when they are at the corner of the street , only to see the edge of Odgen's cloak disappearing behind the fence gap . 
The two teachers followed on a narrow alley adjacent to the fence higher than the broader back . 
The trail is crooked , pebbled and crooked , as is the steep slope , which seems to be leading to a piece of the gloomy tree below them . Enough sure the road soon opened in front of the small yard , two teachers stopped immediately after Odgen , now withdraw wands out . 
Though it was not rippling , the old trees covered the dark shadows , and it took a few seconds before Harry's eyes could see the house hid in half the tangled trunks . 
It seems like this is a ridiculous place for the house , or at least to leave the trees on the side , blocking out the light and the valley below . 
She wondered if there was someone there ? 
Walls of moss , roof tile fell off the roof 
the roof . 
The ghost grows around , and the tops of the windows are covered with a thick layer of dust . However , when it is concluded that no one can be there , the window is open , and a thin cloud of smoke exits . Well , maybe someone is cooking . 
Ogden came forward lightly , seemingly to Harry in the overspray . 
As the tree shines on him , he stops , staring at the main door that someone pinned a dead snake . 
Then there was a rustle and a rumbling sound , a guy in a tu form fell from the nearest tree , his feet on the ground in front of Odgen , leaping back so fast that he stepped on his shirt and stumbled . 
" He was not welcome . " The guy in front of them had dull hair so hated that he did not know what color anymore . He missing some teeth . Eight is small and dark eyes only stare opposite . 
He looks funny but really , he makes people afraid . 
Harry could not help but tell Odgen a few more steps and talk . 
" Good morning . 
I am the man of the Ministry of Magic ! " He was not welcome . " " Oh , sorry , I do not understand , " Odgen said confused . 
Harry thought Odgen was completely dim ; The stranger spoke of him very clearly to Harry , especially when he waved his wand with one hand , the other with a bloody knife . 
" I'm sure I understand what he said , Harry ? " Dumbledore whispered , " Of course . " Harry was a bit embarrassed . " Why did not Odgen ... ? " But when he saw the snake die on the door again , it suddenly came to mind . out . 
" He speaks Patois ? " " That's good , " Dumbledore nodded and smiled . 
That guy is now coming forward in front of Odgen , a hand is a knife , a hand is wand . 
" Now , look .. " but it was too late ! The explosion resounded , Odgen was lying on the ground , hugging his nose , while the dreadful yellow gleamed between his fingers . 
" Morfin " ! 
A voice said . 
Another old man rushed out of the house , slamming the door behind him , causing the snake to swing wildly . The guy was shorter , the person did not match . 
Broad shoulders , long sleeves , brown eyes , dense hair , wrinkled face looked like a big and healthy monkey . 
Immediately next to the knife holder , giggling before Odgen measured the land . " The Ministry of Magic is not it ? " The older man said , looking down at Odgen . " That's right , " Odgen said angrily , patting his face . " And you , you're Gaunt ? " " Yes , " Gaunt said . " It gave him a shot at the right face ? " " Yes , it was him . " Odgen paused . " You want people to know your presence ? " " This is a personal matter . Only standing there expecting my son to do nothing to protect himself ? " " What is self defense ? " Odgen said , standing up . 
" The guys do not invite . Muggle . " Rubbish . " Odgen pointed his wand into his nose , still flowing stuff that looked like gold , it stopped flowing . Gaunt said . Do not quarrel . " At this point , Harry was ready to listen to the verb , even while understanding what they were saying , it still distinguished from the rattling sound that Odgen heard . Morin seemed to disagree , but his father threw a threatening look , and he changed . , slammed into the house with the leaning back and slamming the door to make the snake fall to poor . " Because your son is here , Mr. Gaunt , " said Odgen , rubbing his pus 
finally stick in front of the shirt . 
" It's Morfin , is not it ? " " It's Morfin , " said the old man indifferently . " Are you pure blood ? " 
" That's not the point here , " said Odgen coldly , and Harry's respect for Odgen increased . 
Gaunt looks different . 
He rolled his eyes at Odgen and mumbled , obviously with a croaking voice . " Now I think of it . I've seen the nose being like him in the village . " " I do not doubt it if his son dies . calm , " said Odgen . " Perhaps we should continue to discuss in the house ? "" In the house ? "" Yes , Mr. Gaunt . 
I'm here because of Morfin . We have to send the owl . "" I did not use the shotgun . " Gaunt said . " I did not open the mail . "" Then you could complain that you were not notified of my arrival , " said Odgen frustrated . " I'm here because of a serious offense that happened early on . " " Okay , okay ! " Gaunt growled . " On this dead house , how comfortable would he be ? " The house seemed to have three small rooms . 
Two doors led into the main room , both the kitchen and the living room . Morin was sitting on the dingy stool beside the fire , wrapping the snake vipe in his hand and hum . " Wheeze , wheeze , baby snake . Let's get on with Morfin . Then there's the door knocking . " There was a curl of something in the corner of the open window , Harry realized that there was another man in the room , a ragged girl . in a gray dress like a dirty stone wall behind her back . 
The girl stands by the pot boiling on the grimy black furnace , around the shelf on the pots , the dirty pans . Her hair is gray , drooping . She has a very real face , pale and slightly . Her eyes , like his brother , were staring opposite him . She was more clean than the two men , but Harry thought that it would not see anybody looking weaker . 
" My daughter , Merope , " Gaunt said reluctantly as Ogden looked at her inquisitively . 
" Hello , " Odgen said . 
She did not answer , but her father's threatened look made her return to the room , continuing to place the pots on the shelf . " Well , Mr. Gaunt , " Odgen said , " to get right on the subject , we have reason to believe that your son , Morfin , performed miracles in front of Muggles late at night . " 
Merope drops a pot . 
" Pick it up ! " Gaunt shouted . " What the hell did you do like the Muggles ? What the wand is for , you're useless like a garbage bag . " " Gaunt , please . " Odgen was shocked . , picked up the pot , flushed , dropped again , shivered the wand , pointed at the pot , hurriedly read the mantra nobody heard so the pot shot straight on the floor from where She reached the opposite wall , breaking in half . 
Morfin burst into laughter . 
The gaunt shouted , " It's okay , you're not good at anything . 
Cut it off . " Merope slipped across the room , but before she had time to raise her wand , Odgen lifted his chopsticks , firmly in his voice , " Reparo . " The healer was immediately healed . 
Gaunt's eyes widened , though he was about to yell at Odgen , then he seemed to think again , turning to ridicule his daughter : " Are you the nice man of the Ministry of Magic ? 
Maybe he will bring you out of my hand , maybe he does not feel sorry for those 
Squib dirty ... " Not looking at anyone as well as thanking Odgen , Merope picked up the pot and placed it in her old , shaking hands . Then she leaned back against the wall between the window and the dirty stove , As if she had no wish but to disappear into the stone wall . " Mr. Gaunt " Odgen started again . " As I said , the cause of my visit was ... .... "" I heard you say it once , " Gaunt replied . Morfin gives the Muggle a little bit of what's happening to him - what's up ? " Morfin broke the law , " Odgen said sternly . Gaunt mimicked Odgen's voice , making him swagger and moaning . Morin laughed again . " It teaches the Muggle Muggle a lesson , now it's all right . is it legal "" That's right , " said Odgen . " I'm afraid . " He pulled out of his pocket in a small roll of parchment , pulling it out . 
" What is it , his sentence ? " Gaunt said , his voice angry . " It's a summons from the Ministry of Magic to hear .... 
" Appointment ! 
Appointment ? 
Who do you think you are , summon our children anywhere ? "" I'm the chief of the magic enforcement department , " said Odgen . " So you think we're a scoundrel ? " Gaunt screamed , going to Odgen with the grimy yellow nails pointing to his chest . " These scum will run until the Ministry calls out ? 
Do you know who you are talking to ? who is also a little bloody mud ? "" I'm glad to talk to Mr. Gaunt , " said Odgen , looking cautious but still standing . 
" That's right , " Gaunt growled . At first , Harry thought Gaunt made a bad gesture by hand , but realized that he was trying to show off the hideous black ring in his middle finger , slamming in front of his eyes . is this 
See this ? 
Know what this is ? 
Know where to go ? For centuries in our house , know how long , always pure blood . How much do we pay for this , with the Peverell badge hit the rock face ? "" I have no idea , " said Odgen , his eyes glimmering with a glinting ring in front of his nose for an inch . " It was on the sidelines , Mr. Gaunt , his son was sticking . " Screaming in rage , Gaunt ran to the girl . For a second , Harry thought he was about to strangle her , as his hand touched her neck , but a moment later he dragged her forward . Odgen's face with the gold necklace around her neck . 
" See this ? " He roared , shaking his large golden locket , despite Merope chewing and panting . 
" I see it , I see it , " Odgen said hastily . " Slytherin House ! " Gaunt shouted . " Salazar Slytherin House ! 
We are the remaining descendants , What do you think ? "" Mr. Gault , your daughter , " Odgen warned , but Gault had let go of Merope . 
She walked away from him , back at her corner , rubbing her neck , breathing . 
" That's it , " Gaunt triumphantly argued , proving to be one of the most intractable of the most controversial . 
" Do not say come talk to us like sand in the shoe . The pure - blooded generation , more than you can say , I do not doubt . " at the foot of Odgen . 
Morfin laughed again . 
Merope nodded to the window , lowered her head , hiding her face in her hair , and said nothing . " Mr. Gaunt " Odgen patiently , " I'm afraid your ancestors or me will not be involved in this case . I'm here because of Morfin , Morfin and Muggle people talking to him last night . Our source ... " He glanced down at the roll of paper , " Morfin used a spell or something for the Muggles , causing him to fester with pain . " Morfin chuckled . 
" Silent look " Gaunt growled with a baton , Morfin im immediately . 
" What if it did ? " Gaunt said harshly . " I wish you'd wiped that trashy Muggle face , its memory ... .. " This is a deliberate attack , not a defense . "" Ah , I feel like you are a Muggle - loving person , " said Gaunt . 
" This discussion does not take us anywhere , " said Odgen seriously . 
" His son's attitude is clearly not regretting his actions . " He glanced down at the parchment again . " Morfin will have to be present on Sept . 14 to explain the use of magic . in front of the Muggles and hurt and painful to the person himself ... " Odgen had to stop . There was the creaking sound of the horses and the big laugh in the window . 
It looks like the direction of the wind blowing from the village is very close to the bushes outside the house . Gaunt shivering , ear listening , eyes wide . 
Morfin whistled , turning his face to the side with the sound , eager . Merope raised her head . Harry saw her face white . 
" God , it was an eye - opener , " the girl's voice sounded , clear from the window as if she were standing in the next room . 
" Your father can clean that shabby house ? " " It's not right for him , " the young man said . " Everything on the other side of the valley is from his house , but the cottage alone is that of an old wanderer called Gaunt , and his children . The boy is completely crazy , and he should hear the village folk . " The girl laughed . 
Then the leng keng knot knot at each large . 
Morphing to leave the armchair . 
" You sit there , " his father used a warning word . 
" Tom " is the voice of the girl , now they almost stand inside . " Maybe I'm wrong , but is there someone hanging the snake on the door ? " " God , I'm not mistaken , " the voice of " You must be a little kid , " he said , " I do not think so , Cecilia , " he said now . 
" Honey , " Morfin whispered in his tongue , looking up at his sister . " Baby , listen to it . 
Then that guy does not know you . " Merope looked white , making Harry feel she was about to faint . 
" What is it ? " Gaunt's tone was sharp , and also in tongue , looking at his son to his daughter . " What do you say , Morfin ? " " He looks at that Muggle guy " expressing disgust at his face as he watched his frightened sister . 
" Whenever he crosses the garden , he looks at the man through the fence . 
And last night .. ... " Merope shook her head as if begging , but Morfin continued unabashedly , " Still looking out the window looking at that guy in the house again ? "" Lift your head out the window to see a Muggle ? 
" Gaunt's voice shrieked . The three Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Odgen , bewildered and upset by the incomprehensible new outburst of the hissing and harsh rattles . 
" Is that right ? " Ganut said in a deadly voice , one or two steps ahead of the frightened girl . " My daughter - the purest descendant of Salazar Slytherein - likes a dirty muddy guy ? " 
Merope shook her head crazily , hugging the wall , speechless . 
" But you took that and then your father . " Morin smiled briefly . " I grabbed it as it passed and it looked so ugly with holes all over , did not Merope ? " " The Squib " Gaunt growled , losing control of himself , striking her daughter . Both Harry and Odgen shouted at the same time , " NO , " Odgen held up his wand . " Relaskio ! " Gaunt was knocked out . throwing the back , sliding on a chair , he found his back moist . 
Outraged , Morfin jumped out of the couch to run to Odgen , dropping the bloody knife and releasing the spell . 
Ogden ran for sale , Dumbledore motioned for Harry to hear him , his ears echoing Merope's screams . 
Odgen jumps out of the trail and protrudes onto the road , slamming onto a shiny chestnut horse , riding on a young , dark - haired young man . The beautiful young man and horse ride the gray horse next to him . They burst into laughter when Odgen burst out of the butt of the horse and plunged in again , his cloak flying from head to toe dirt , scattered on the road . " Let's go Harry , " Dumbledore tugged at his elbow . 
Just a moment later , the two had soared through the darkness gently until their feet touched the ground , returning to Dumbledore's dimly lit office . " What's going to happen to the girl living in that house ? " Harry asked as he waved his lighted wand and lit the lights . " Merope , what is her name ? " " She's okay " Go down the table and signal him to sit down . " Odgen landed on the magic set , and 15 minutes later came back to the reinforcements . 
Morfin and his father tried to fight , but then both were overpowered , escorted out of the house , and then was convicted by the witch council . 
Morfin , a former Muggle convict , received three years in prison in Azkaban . 
Marvolo , injuring several staff members , including Odgen , received six months in prison . "" Marvolo , " Harry wondered , " that's right , " Dumbledore grinned . " I'm glad you did not miss the name . " So that old man is ... ... .... . To "" Oh , Voldemort's grandfather , " he said . " Marvolo , his son , Morfin , daughter of Merope are the rest of the longtime witch family , noticed by blood and abnormal blood . To marry in the same line . To lose true love affair in marriage just to maintain the regal lifestyle that they wasted family wealth through the generations before Marvolo born . 
He , as I see it , is left with filth and poverty , with an uncomfortable temperament but full of arrogance and self - indulgence , some heirlooms he values ​​ as a son and more than a child . "" So Merope ? " Harry leaned in to look at Dumbledore intently . " So Merope is ... .. I mean I'm .... is Voldemort's mother ? " That's right , we have the same idea about the father as well . of Voldemort . 
I do not know if you pay attention ? "" The Muggle people that Morfin attacked , that rider , Master ? " I'm pretty good , " said the smiling man . " Oh , that's Tom Riddle's father , the handsome Muggle , riding past the Gaunts , whom Merope hugged in secret , with intense passion . " " Finally they married ? " Harry could not believe what he said , it did not imagine the two have nothing in common . 
" I thought you forgot that Merope was a witch . 
I do not believe that her powers reached the highest level when her father made horrible . 
Once Marvolo and Morfin are in Azkaban , surely the first time in her life she is alone , I am sure she can measure her ability and plan to escape the life of her husband . she has gone 18 years . "" Can you think of a way for Merope to make Tom Riddle forget the Muggle girl and love her ? "" Submission , " Harry guessed . " Or is it love ? "" That was Harry . 
Personally , I prefer to use her . 
I would certainly be more romantic towards her and believe that it would not be hard to convince Riddle to drink a glass of water when he rode alone on a hot day . 
In any case , just a few months after the scene and I was witnessed , Little Hangleton village will be a big scandal . 
You can imagine the rumors of secretly pursuing a fugitive son runaway with a wandering daughter , Merope . " But the villagers ' shock was nothing compared to Marvolo . 
He returned from Azkaban , expecting his obedient daughter to wait for him to return to the hot meal already on the table . 
Instead , he saw an inch of thick dust and a piece of paper , explaining what she was doing . " From then on , I was reminded that during the rest of his life he never mentioned the name or the existence of the girl . 
The shock of her departure probably contributed to his early death - or simply he never learned to take care of himself . As Azkaban weakened Marvolo , he could not . Live to see Morfin come home . "" Merope ? 
She has .. ... . are not you 
Did not Voldemort grow up in an orphanage ? "" Yes , " said Dumbledore . " We have to guess a lot , but I do not think it's too hard to figure out what happened . 
You see , just a few months after the marriage was over , Tom Riddle appeared on Hangleton's cottage page without his wife . 
The rumor spread over his neighbors that he said he was cheated and deceived . 
What he wants to say , I'm sure he was spellbound and escaped but I'm not sure he dares to use the exact word for fear of being insane . 
However , when he heard what he said , the villagers thought Merope had lied to Tom Riddle , pretending to have a baby with him so he had to marry . " But it was true that she had a baby with him . " " But less than a year after the wedding , Tom Riddle dropped her when she was pregnant . " " What's wrong ? 
Why does not love medicine anymore ? " Just had to guess , " said Dumbledore . " I believe Merope loved her deeply , unable to continue to make him slave with magic . 
I believe she had the choice of stopping him from drinking her love . 
Maybe she was mistaking him for having fallen in love with her now . 
Maybe she thought he would stay for the sake of the child . 
If so , she was wrong on both points . 
He left , never seen her , nor wondered what would happen to his son . " Outside was dark as ink , and the lamp in Dumbledore's room was brighter than ever . 
" I think it's enough today , Harry , " said Dumble one moment later . 
" Yes , Master . " She lifted her legs but did not go . " Teacher ... Knowing all this about Vodemort's past is important ? " " I think very important . " " And it has something to handle the prophecy ? " 
" It has everything to handle with the prophecy . " " Yes , " Harry was still a little hesitant , but he was sure he would . 
He turned away , but came up with another question , and returned . " Teacher , are you allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything ? " Dumbledore looked at him for a moment and said , " Yes . 
We think Weasley and Granger have proven themselves very credible . 
But Harry , I ask you to tell them not to tell anyone else . 
It's not a good idea to reiterate how much we know or doubt Voldemort's secrets . "" No , I'm sure there are only Ron and Herminone who know . 
Have a good night . " He turned away and came closer to the door when he saw the object . 
Lying on one of the tables with thin legs like a reed , there are countless thin silver utensils , an ugly gold ring with a large black rock face . " Master , " Harry looked at the ring . " That ring ... " " What ? " " You wore it when you visited Professor Slughorn that night ? " " I was wearing it . Dmbledore confirmed . 
" But is it the Marvolo Gaunt ring that gave Odgen a look ? " The nodded . " That's it . " " But what ? 
Do you have it for a long time ? " No , I have it recently , a few days before I came to pick you up at your aunt . " " About the time you hurt my arm ? "" That's right , Harry , around that time . " Harry felt awkward . 
Dumbledore was smiling . 
" Look , that's right ... " " Late , Harry , I ' ll hear the story at another time . 
Good night ! "" Good night " 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 11 Hermione's Help 
Just as Hermione had predicted , the sixth - year student's free time was not the time to relax as Ron expected , but to catch up with the huge amount of exercise assigned . 
In addition to having to study as if they had taken the exam each day , each session also became much more demanding than before . In the process , Harry almost did not understand half of McGonagall's lectures , and even Hermione Also , ask the teacher to repeat the instructions one or two times . 
It is unbelievable and despite Hermione's increasing reaction , the poison suddenly becomes Harry's best subject ; thanks to the Blood Prince . 
Pendulums are now required not only in Dark Arts , but also in Charms and Transfiguration . 
Harry often sees his classmates in the common room or during the blush and nervous ejaculation , which looks like they have overdosed on U - No - Poo . What : play in English , sounds similar to Voldemort _ ND . 
However , Harry knew that they were trying to make a note without having to read it aloud . Going out and learning in the conservatory becomes a pleasant experience , although learning to plant more deadly than ever before in Herbalism is by no means permitted . Unique hug from the back suddenly . 
As a result of dozens of exercises and maniacal hours , Harry , Ron and Hermione have no time to visit Hagrid . 
Hagrid no longer had lunch at the teacher's desk , a bad sign , and on some occasions when they passed by him in the hallway or on the yard , he did not hear or hear them say hello hidden . We have to come to an explanation , Hermione said , staring at Hagrid's huge empty seat at the teacher's porch the next Saturday morning . 
But we have a Quidditch team selection this morning Ron replied . 
And we have to practice Flitcwick's Aguamenti ! 
Besides , what would it be like to say that we hate that dirty subject ? 
We did not hate the subject Hermione said . Say it yourself , I still have not forgotten the tail shot Ron muttered . 
And to tell you , we got away with that blessed way . 
You have not heard all day about his unconscious uncle . 
We would have to teach Grawp how to tie up if I stay . I hate to talk to Hagrid . Hermione says with a mournful tone . We will go after the Quidditch Harry reassured her . 
He also remembers Hagrid , though , as well as Ron , he thinks it is better not to have Grawp in their lives . 
But the team test can take the whole morning , with the number of people registered . 
He felt a little nervous about facing the first burden of the Tactical . I do not know why the team suddenly became so crowded . All right , Harry , Hermione said in a sudden voice no longer patient . 
That's not Quiddich , but you ! 
You've never been more attractive than this , and to tell you the truth , you're worth it , and Ron's mouth is filled with a big salted fish . 
Hermione gave Ron a scathing look before turning to Harry . Everyone knew he was telling the truth , was not he ? 
The wizarding world recognizes that he was right about Voldemort returning and that he had fought with him twice in the past two years and had escaped both times . 
And now they call you the chosen person - Why , you still do not see how everyone was attracted to you ? It was true that Harry had seen the Courtroom become unusually hot , even though the ceiling was still cold . wet . 
And he had gone through all the mistreatment of the Ministry when they tried to make him look like a liar and inconsiderate . 
You still see the marks on the back of the hand that barbarian woman made him write in his blood , but anyway he did not give up what he said He can still see the place where the money that brains in the Ministry of Magic , look here ! , Said Ron , shaking his sleeve back . 
And it was not painful when he was over one foot this summer . 
Hermione finished , not even looking at Ron . 
High Ron said no way to eat anything . 
But the owl messed with the fly , swooped down through the windows and threw rain and poured water on everyone . 
Most people receive more correspondence than usual ; Parents are anxious to hear from their children and reassure them that everyone at home is okay . 
Harry had not had a letter from the beginning , so the only person to write to him was now dead and though he had been waiting for Lupine's letter , to date , had been silent . 
So this morning he was surprised to see Hedwig flying around among the brown and gray owls . 
It's parked in front of Harry , 
Take a large square package . 
Soon after , a full - bodied parcel was parked in front of Ron , underneath it was a pile of burned spots , Pigwidgeon . Ha ! Harry rang up , opened the package , and revealed a novel , high - tech novel , from Flourish and Blotts . 
Oh well , Hermione said , cheerful voice Now you can pay the book written back then You're crazy , Harry said . 
I ' ll keep it ! 
I thought about it _ He pulled the book out of his briefcase and tapped on his cover with his wand , mumbling Dijjindo ! The book's cover leaves . 
Harry did the same with the new book . ( Hermione looked scolded ) . 
Then he changed the two covers and , typing them up again and shouting Snap ! Now on the table was the Prince's book , which looked like a new book and , next to it , a new book from Flourish and Blotts , looked just like an old book . 
I ' ll pay Slughorn a new book , he will not complain , it costs 9 cents . Galleon scolds Hermione lips , looked frustrated and disagreed but then distracted by a third owl Down carrying a Sorcerer's Daily . 
She opened it and dropped it on the front page . Is there anyone we know die ? Asked Ron in a polite voice ; the question he asked each time Hermione opened the newspaper . 
No , but there are a few more attacks of suckers . 
Hermione replied , And a great arrest , who is that ? Harry asked , thinking it was Bellatrix Lestrange . ' Stanley Shunpike answered Hermione . What ? 
Harry was startled . 
' Stanley Shunpike , the ticket taker on the familiar bus in the wizarding world , was arrested with suspicion regarding the activities of the TRUTH . 
Shunpike , 21 , was taken away last night after a surprise encounter at his home in Clapham Stan Shunpike , a Death Eater ? Harry asked in his stomach to think of the young man he had met three years ago . Impossible ! He could have been ripped off by Ron . 
You can never know . 
No way Hermione , still reading the newspaper , said . They said that he was arrested because he had been intercepted while discussing the secret of the Death Eater in a bar . 
She looked up with a frown . If he had been spotted by the Observer , would not you have gotten around to talking about the Death Eaters ? It sounded like he was bragging over what we could do to Ron . 
Did he ever claim to be the Minister of Magic when he was chatting with the girls ? Oh he is . 
Harry replied . I did not know what they were doing , thinking Stan was real . They wanted to see what they were doing . Hermione frowned . 
People are afraid , you know that the parents of twin Patil parents want them back home ? 
and Elsie Midgen pulled out of school . 
Her father picked it up last night . Huh ! 
Said Ron , eyes wide with Hermione . But Hogwarts are much safer than theirs , sure enough ! 
We have divine light , and other protective words , and we have Dumbledore ! 
I do not think we always have Hermione whispered , and glanced at the teacher's desk . Do not you see ? 
His seat was empty as often as Hagrid's place last week . Harry and Ron looked at the teacher's desk . 
The chair of the principal's principal is empty . Until now , when he thought about it , he realized that he had not seen Dre from a private lesson a week ago . 
I think he left school to do something with the Hermione Society in a low voice . I think everything seems serious , right ? 
Harry and Ron did not answer , but Harry knew that all three were thinking about the same thing . There were terrible things that happened the day before , when Hannah Abbott was called out of herbal medicine and was told that her mother had died . 
And they did not see Hannah in prison . 
When they left Gryffindor five minutes later to go down to Qh , they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil . 
Still remembered that Hermione was told about the Patil parents want their children to leave Hogwarts , Harry was not surprised to see two close friends whispering looks very tense . What surprised him was that when Ron walked past them , Parvati suddenly raised his elbows on Lavender , as she looked around and then grinned at Ron . 
Ron blinked at the girl and then smiled shyly . 
His gaze immediately after that suddenly became stigmata . 
Harry tried very hard to stop laughing , remembering that Ron had done so after Malfoy broke his nose . 
However , Hermione became cold and kept her way all the way down to the stadium under cold and frosty rain and then found a place and did not bother Ron well . As expected , the rehearsal lasted for most of the morning . 
It seems that half of the Gryffindors have come , from the first year students , who are still thrilled to grab the old school brooms , until the seventh year students , taller than the crowd and look just fine . 
There was a tall man with hair like a wire that Harry immediately recognized from his trip on the Hogwarts . 
Have we met on the ship , in the sluggies of the Sluggy ? She spoke very confidently and stepped out of the crowd to shake Harry's hand . 
Cormac McLaggen , Player You did not try last year , did you ? Asked Harry , looking at McLaggen's width and thinking that maybe he could block all three golfers without moving . 
I was in the hospital when the rehearsal took place McLaggen said , in a very swagger voice . 
Eat a pound of love eggs for a whip A Harry said . Oh , you could wait over there Harry pointed to the edge of the yard , near where Hermione was sitting . 
Harry thought he saw McLaggen's exasperation and wondered if McLaggen was waiting for a favor as both were Sluggy's hard - earned disciples . 
Harry decides to start with some very basic tests , asking for team quizzes and flying around the yard . This is the right decision : the first ten candidates are 10 students in one year and quite obviously they have never flown before . 
There was only a little boy who tried to stay up in the air for a few seconds and then he was surprised to see himself stabbed into a golf post . 
The second group consists of the ten stupidest girls Harry ever saw . 
When he blows the whistle , he just falls down , his mouth giggling and holding hands . 
Romilda Vane is one of them . 
And when he told them to leave the yard , they followed suit and sat down in the chair to point others . 
The third team dug into a pile in the middle of the pitch . 
Most fourth groups come without a broom . 
The fifth group is the Hufflepuffs . If anyone is not Gryffindor Harry was really irritated , screaming leave this place soon ! No one said anything , then two children from Ravenclaws ran out of the yard , giggling . 
After two hours , with a lot of complaints , a few fits , a Comet 260 collision and several broken teeth , Harry found out three Tragedies : Katie Bell , who returned to the team after one session . Demelza Robins was a newcomer , who was very good at dodging the Gunners and Ginny Weasley , who surpassed all competitions and scored 17 goals . 
Although quite satisfied with his options , Harry also had to scream loudly with the complainers and now are subjected to the same battle with the injured Clouds . That's my final decision and if you do not get out of the way of the golf player , I ' ll give you some curse . Harry roars . 
None of the selected players were dicked by Fred and George , but Harry was also quite pleased with them : Jimmy Peakes , a third year student , was not tall but loud , and left Harry a clump . u eggs with a star with a sharp blow on the fruit Bludger . 
And Ritchie Coote , looking thin but able to ball very well . 
Two people along with Katie , Demelza , and Ginny were in the stands to see the final selection of the team . 
Harry has deliberately tried to recruit the golfer to the end with the hope that the stadium would be absent and put less pressure . 
Unfortunately , some people after breakfast have come down with all the bad guys that make up the crowd more than ever . 
Whenever a golf player goes out to the pillar , the stadium is filled with cheers and mockery . 
Harry looked over at Ron , who always had a nervousness in these cases , in the hope of winning the final of last year's cure . 
But obviously not , Ron looks green ! 
None of the five candidates were more than two . 
Harry was disappointed that Cormac McLaggen only saved four of the five . 
However , in the end , Cormac McLaggen flew completely out of the way , causing the crowd to be a laugh to ridicule the guy . 
McLaggen flew to the ground , clenching his teeth . 
Ron looked ready to pass when he climbed onto the broom . Good luck ! A voice from the audience . 
Harry looked around , hoping it was Hermione , but it was Lavender Brown . 
He wanted to cover his face when she screamed again , but as the captain , he thought he had to look a little better , so he turned to look at Ron . 
However , Harry did not have to worry : Ron saved one , two , three , four consecutive fruit . 
Excited and struggling to resist shouting at the crowd , Harry turned to McLaggen telling him that , unlucky , Ron won . 
Harry could see the face of a red - faced man standing inches from his shoulders . His sister did not play really McLaggen said spite . 
There was even a jet of blood in its anger as Harry had seen in Vernon . 
She had to catch the ball . 
That was the result that he nearly missed the slide . McLaggen approaches Harry , now landed . Give me another chance No , Harry said . 
He had his turn . 
He saved four goals . 
Ron saved the year . 
Ron is now a golfer , he has won fairly . 
Now he avoided the moment He thought for a moment that McLaggen would punch him , but he had restrained himself with an ugly grimace and ran away , snarling something that sounded threatening . 
Harry turned and saw the team staring at him . 
Very good , Harry groaned . You flew so well _ _ _ You played really well , Ron ! This time , it was Hermione who was running towards Ron from the stands . Harry saw Lavender leave the field , holding Parvati's hand , his face acrimonious . 
Ron looked satisfied with himself and looked taller than usual when he grinned at the team and to Hermione . 
After fixing the time for the first training session next year , Harry , Ron and Hermione bid farewell to the team and headed for Hagrid's tent . 
The sun shone through the clouds and the sky has stopped drizzling . 
Harry felt hungry and hoped he would have something to eat at Hagrid's place . I think I got the fourth penalty Ron said happy voice . 
A hard fruit from Demelza , you guys see , it's a little messy _ Yes , yes , you are super Hermione says , look happy face . 
Anyway , I'm better than McLaggen , Ron said in a high - pitched voice . Did you see it go wrong in the fifth ? 
It looks like I lost it . . 
Harry was surprised to see Hermione turn red when he heard these words . 
Ron did not notice anything because he was still delirious about describing each penalty with an interest . 
A hippogriff , Bang , a large brown being forced in front of Hagrid's cabin . 
He nibbled on the sharp razor when he saw the three of them come and turned their heads toward them . Ui , Hermione said suspiciously . It still seems scary , right ? 
Come on , you used to ride it , did not you ? Ron said , stepping forward and leaning down in front of Hippogriff and still looking into his eyes . 
After a few seconds , the Equinox also bent down and saluted . How are you ? Harry whispered , approaching his feathered head . Do you remember ? 
But are you okay with Hagrid ? 
Oh ! Hagrid strode out of the corner of the cabin wearing a flower apron and carrying a bag of potatoes . 
Fang , his big hound dog is hanging around his legs . 
Fang barked and leaped forward . 
Keep away from it ! 
He ' ll eat his fingers off now _ _ _ À are you flying ? 
Fang also leaped up to Hermione and Ron , trying to lick their ears . 
Hogwarts stood and looked at them for a moment and then back inside the cabin and slammed it off . Said Hermione frightenedly . Do not worry , Harry said . 
He walked to the door and knocked on the door . Hagrid ! 
Open the door , we want to talk to you ! There is no static from the inside . If you do not open , we ' ll break the door ! Said Harry , and drew the wand . Harry ! Said Hermione , in astonishment . He could not _ _ _ Yes he could ! Harry whispered back . _ But before he could even say a word , the door burst open as Harry thought , and Hagrid stood there , staring at him , and looking very wary though he was still wearing . flower apron . I am a teacher ! Uncle barked to Harry A teacher understand , Potter ! 
How dare to scare my own ! Sorry , sir ! Said Harry , pressing on the last word and he dropped the wand into his shirt . 
Hagrid looks stunned . Since when did you call me ? 
Since when did you call me Potter ? 
Well , Hagrid grumbled . Very sad , so I was fooled ? and then here , the ungrateful children . Her grief muttered , he stood back to let them pass . 
Hermione ran after Harry , still looking a little afraid . Star ? Hagrid grumbled , as Harry Ron and Hermione sat down around his huge wooden table , Fang kneeling his head on Harry's knee , his waist spilling over his coat . What's wrong ? 
The future is pity me ? 
Think we are lonely or what ? 
No , Harry responds immediately We want to meet you We miss you ! 
Asked Hermione , her voice trembling . Hagrid snorted . Then he threw himself around , making tea in his huge copper kettle , muttering something for a moment . 
Finally he placed three large cups of brown tea with a bucket in front of them and a plate of hard ice . 
Harry was so hungry that even Hagrid's cakes made one . Hagrid , Hermione said gulping , when he sat down with them and began to peel potatoes in a very rough way as if each bully had done something wrong with him so we wanted to continue learning Cham Mysterious squid , you know , Hagrid snorted again . 
Harry thought there were some blows of his nose on the potato and thought in his stomach that fortunately they did not stay for dinner . It's true that we want Hermione to speak . But none of us can arrange the schedule . " Hagrid repeated . 
Something crashed and everyone was watching : Hermione cried for an hour and Ron slipped out of the seat and hurriedly ran around the table , away from the big box in the corner that they had just discovered . 
It is full of things that look like long , white , long , long foot worms , and are writhing What's wrong , Hagrid ? 
Harry asked , trying to speak in a more pleasant voice than in disgust , but also at the same time . These are giant maggots , Hagrid said . And will they become ? 
Ron said with awe that they did not fit in . Hagrid told me to get them to eat Aragog . And as if without warning , he burst into tears . Hagrid ! Cried Hermione , jumping out of the chair and running around the long side of the table to avoid the maggot box and put her hand on her shaking shoulder . What was that ? 
It .. it . . 
Hagrid hissed , his eyes still in tear , despite the fact that he wiped away with the apron . 
Aragog .. I think it's going to die , It's sick from the summer and it's not going to get better .. I'm not sure what to do if it does . . 
We have known each other too long Hermione patted on the shoulder of Uncle Hagrid , do not know what to say . 
Harry knew how she felt . 
You already know that Hagrid had donated a dreaded baby dragon to a stuffed animal , had seen the lion scorpion ruin with his mouth sucked , saw him trying to explain to his giant brother man , but perhaps this is the most puzzling of all your monster hobbies : a giant spider , Aragog , who lives in the Forbidden Forest that Harry and Ron had been lucky to escape four years ago . here . Are there any things they can do ? Asked Hermione , not paying attention to Ron's grimace and shakes . 
I do not think so , Hermione , Hagrid hiccups , trying to stop the tears from flowing . Spiders , Aragog's family is becoming a bit weird when it gets sick , they become more aggressive . 
Yes , I think I've seen that before , Ron said in a deranged voice . I do not think anybody but me would be safe to come near them now Hagrid finished with a sharp blow on the apron and looked up . But thanks for the offer Hermione , it was very meaningful . After that , the air seemed a bit lighter , although neither Harry nor Ron seemed willing to feed the giant worms to the giant spider , Hagrid seemed to himself . They would have liked to do that and come back as Hagrid as ever . Well , I've always known that they would be hard to put on and that our schedules would fly and say goodbye , even if there was a time back _ _ _ We could not do it That's what Hermione says we've ruined all of that . Turn the time of the previous Summer Magician . 
It has been published on the Daily News . Well , then Hagrid said . There is no way to fly I'm sorry , I did , I know I'm worried about Aragog .. and I was wondering if Professor Grubby Plank taught _ Just wait until then , all three of them have been lying to the full extent that Professor GrubblyPlank , who replaced Hagrid a few times , is a bad teacher , so when they say goodbye to Hagrid , was quite fun . I was hungry , Harry said as the wings were closed behind them and the three rushed past the dark and unlucky pitch . 
He stopped the stone cake after a terrible crack from his molar . 
And I have a punishment with Snape tonight , there will be enough time for dinner . When all three of them enter the castle , they see Cormac McLaggen coming into the Hall . 
It was only two times before it passed through the door , it crashed into the door frame for the first time . 
Ron just laughed and ran lonily and in the hall behind McLaggen , but Harry grabbed Hermione's hand and held her . What ? 
Hermione said in a defensive tone , You ask me , Harry whispered , McLaggen looked like he had lost his mind . 
And it stood in front of Hermione's face . All right , I did it , she whispered . 
But you must have heard it about Ron and Ginny ! 
Besides , it was a temperamental temper , and he had seen how it behaved when he was knocked out _ _ he probably did not want a kid like that to look at him . 
No , I think it's true . 
But is not honest ? 
Are you a fraternity ? 
Hermione pulled away and Harry laughed sarcastically . " What are you doing ? " Demanded Ron , reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious . What are you doing ? 
Asked Ron , reappearing in the Great Hall and looking distrustfully . Nothing , Harry and Hermione answered , and hurried to Ron . 
The smell of grilled beef made Harry's stomach boil for hunger , but when they were three feet away from Gryffindor's table , Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them , blocking the way . Harry , Harry , whom I am looking forward to see here ! He laughed , twisted the hooks , and folded his large belly . I'm hoping to meet you before dinner ! 
What do you think of a dinner in my place ? 
We have a small party , some rising stars . 
We have McLaggen and Zabini , the charming girl Melida Bobbin _ I do not know if you know her ? 
The family owns a chain of pharmacies _ and of course I also hope Miss Granger will come to support me 
Slughorn bowed slightly to Hermione as he stopped . 
It seems that Ron was not there . 
Slughorn never looked at Ron . 
I can not , Professor Harry answered immediately I have a punishment with Professor Snape Oh my god ! Slughorn said , his face slipping . 
I was looking forward to Harry's child ! 
Now let's say a sentence to Severus and explain this . 
I'm sure I could convince him to postpone this punishment for me . 
We ' ll meet both of you later . Then he rushed out of the Hall . He will not have the chance to persuade Snape , Harry said , as soon as Slughorn had his ears knocked out . 
The penalty has been postponed once , Snape does it for Dumbldore , but will not be put off by anyone else . I wish he could go , I do not want to go there alone ! 
Said Hermione nervously . 
Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen . I thought you were going to go alone , Ginny would probably be invited again , or Ron , seemingly unhappy about being ignored by Slughorn . 
After my meal , they returned to Gryffindor Tower . 
The living room was packed , for most of them had finished their dinner , but did not try to find an empty table and sat down , Ron , in a rather unhappy mood since meeting Slughorn , crossed his arms and staring at the ceiling . 
Hermione reached for the Evening Magician , whom somebody had left in the chair . What's New ? 
Asked Harry . No Hermione opened the newspaper and was swiftly scouring the papers inside . 
Oh , look at Ron , his father , Ron _ _ rest assured his father is okay ! You have to say more because Ron started to look worried . 
They only said that his father had come to Malfoy's house . This second search in the mortal realm of the Death Valley does not seem to have anything in common . 
Arthur Weasley of the Forensic and Forensic Surveillance and Detention Section said that his team was working on a trusted source . Said Harry . 
I told him at the crossroads of the King about Malfoy and the thing he was trying to tell Borgin to repair ! 
If it was not at their home , it would have brought it to Hogwarts with it _ _ But how could it do that , Harry ? Said Hermione , putting the newspaper down with a look of surprise . Have we been screened when we arrived ? 
Are you ? 
Said Harry , leaning back . Ah , no , of course you did not , I forgot you were late . And Filch was checking everyone with the Secret Detector when we came in . 
Any dark object was found , and I knew that Crabbe had a tiny head that had been recaptured . 
So you see , Malfoy could not bring anything dangerous . 
For a moment , his throat was blocked , Harry watched Ginny Weasley play with Arnold just before looking at how to respond . Someone sent it to Harry by saying his mother or somebody . They are checked . 
Hermione Filch tells us that he will poke the Secret Detective wherever he can reach him . 
It seemed that there was no way Malfoy was able to bring a dangerous Dark Shield to the school . 
He looked at Ron , who was sitting cross - legged and staring at Lavender , hoping . Do you think of how Malfoy _ _ ? 
Come on , Harry . 
Said Ron . Listen , it's not my fault that Slughorn invited Hermione and me to the party , no one of us wanted to go , you know ! Harry's voice began to grow angry . 
Oh , because I was not invited to any of Ron's party and got up , so I better go to sleep . 
He ran through the door to the male dorm room , staring at Harry and Hermione . Harry ? Demelza Robins , the new Tiny Sister suddenly appears behind his shoulder I have a message for you From GS Slughorn ? Asked Harry , rising up hopefully . 
Not from Professor Snape Demelza . 
Tim said that he would have to go to his room and 830 tonight for the punishment , no matter how many parties he was invited to . 
And I want you to sort out the worm with the bad to use for the poison , and not necessarily wear protective gloves . Ừ Harry says face scowl Thank you so much , Demelza 
Chapter 12 Silver & Pearl Eye Cats 
Where is Dumbledore , and what are you doing ? 
Harry just saw the principal twice in the next few weeks . 
He rarely appeared at meals as before , and Harry was sure that Hermione was right to think that he left school for days at a time . 
Did Dumbledore forget about teaching Harry lessons ? 
You have said that these lessons will lead to something that is related to prophecy ; Harry felt like he was being defended , comforted , and now it felt a bit like being abandoned . 
Mid - August there is the first trip of the semester to Hogsmeade . 
Harry wondered whether these trips would still be allowed , as security measures were tightening around the school , but it was glad to know they were still going ; Get out of the castle for a few hours always great . 
Harry gets up early in the morning of the trip - the sky shows signs of thunderstorms , and he kills the time until breakfast by reading a copy of his high - level magical book . 
She was not in bed reading textbooks ; That thing , as Ron was right , is not good for everyone , except for Hermione , who is simply so strange in that way . 
Harry felt , however , a copy of the Prince's Hypertrophy , which made it difficult to reach the standard of a textbook . 
The more Harry learns about the book , the more he realizes there are more things in it , not just handwritten words or shameless remedies for making drugs , which give Harry a great reputation . With Professor Slughorn , there are also small , imaginative spells scribbled on the sidelines , the ones that Harry was sure of , through the dashes and stains , that the Prince himself composed . out . 
Harry tried several mantras made by himself . 
There is a kind of spell that causes the toes to grow up fast ( worrying about this to Crabbe in the corridor and getting a very interesting result ) ; a mantra that attaches the tongue to the palate ( it was twice as rewarding to Argus Filch that he did not doubt anything at all ) ; And , perhaps , the most useful of them is Muffliato , a mantra filling the ears of any nearby person with unidentified rumbles , so long talks can is conducted in class without worrying about eavesdropping . 
The only person who does not find these spells happy is Hermione , who always holds a tough attitude from end to end and refuses to say anything if Harry spends Muffliato on anyone around him . . 
Sitting on the bed , Harry tilted the book aside to look more closely at the scribbled instructions of a kind of spell that seemed to have caused some trouble for the Prince . 
There was a lot of brick removal and fixing , but in the end , tucked in a corner of the paper was a hasty word : Levicorpus ( nvbl ) While winds and snowstorms slammed into the windows , Neville snored loudly , Harry stared at the words in brackets . 
Nvbl * must mean no voice ( * nonverbal ) . 
Harry wondered if he had made this particular mantra ; It is still difficult for non - verbal charms , which Snape quickly criticized in each and every class in Black Martial Arts . 
On the other hand , the Prince has proved to be a much more effective teacher than Snape so far . 
Without pointing his wand at something specific , Harry flicked it slightly upward and called levicorpus in his head . Aaaaaaaargh ! A flash of light flashed and the room was filled with voices : everyone was awake and Ron was screaming . 
Harry tossed the book into high - grade poisoning into the sky ; Ron is upside down hanging from the air as if an invisible hook lifts it up at the ankle . Sorry - Harry , while Dean and Seamus yelp , and Neville sat up on the floor . after falling from bed . 
Wait a minute - I ' ll let you down - Harry groping for drugs and flipping the pages in panic , trying to find the right page ; In the end , it also finds and tries to read the spell below the spell . 
This heaven is the deconstruction , Harry read Liberacorpus ! In the beginning with all its strength . 
Another flash of light flashed , and Ron fell into a pile on his mattress . Sorry - Harry echoed weakly , as Dean and Seamus continued to laugh . Mai , - said Ron , choked , I set the alarm clock . After they had changed their clothes , crammed all over with Mrs. Weasley's warm knit sweatshirts , carrying the cloak . gloves and gloves , Ron's shock has subsided and it is claimed that Harry's new mantra is hilarious ; Too hilarious , so it does not cost a penny to treat Hermione = the story before when they were eating breakfast . and then another flash of light flashes , and I fall down again - Ron grinned , rewarding himself with sausage . 
Hermione did not bother to take a smile throughout the story , and now she turned coldly in disagreement with Harry . That mantra , there is a possibility , is one more verse in her book of poison . Oh , Harry ? - she asked Harry frowned at her : you always jump to the worst conclusion , huh ? right ? That's right , but then ? So you are going to test a mysterious unknown , written by hand , and see what happens ? Why is it a problem if it is written by hand ? Harry said , not having to answer the rest of the question . 
Because it certainly was not allowed by the Ministry of Magic , Hermione said . Plus , she added , as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes , because I began to think that the Prince was a little scammer . Harry and Ron screamed to stop the girl saying instantly . That's just a joke ! , Ron said as he poured tomato mushrooms on his sausage . Just to laugh , Hermione , that's it ! 
By hanging back up people dangling the ankle ? Said Hermione . Who gives the time and effort to create such spells ? Fred and George - Ron said , shrugged - and ... Dad , three - Harry said - He just remembered . what ? Ron and Hermione asked . my dad used to use this spell , Harry said himself , well , Lupine said to me that last part was not right ; In fact , Harry had seen him use the spell to cast Snape , but he had never told Ron and Hermione of his special trip to the Pond . 
Now , though , a possibility suddenly appears in Harry's head . 
When is the blood Prince is ? Maybe your dad used it , Harry , Hermione said , but he was not the only one . 
We've seen a whole bunch of people use it , maybe you've forgotten it . 
Hanging dangling in the air . 
Make them float , numb and not resist Harry stared at her . 
With a feeling of vomiting , it also remembered the actions of the Death Eaters in the Quidditch World Cup . 
Ron helped to salvage it . That's different , Ron said vigorously . Those who abuse it . 
Harry and his father just wanted a joke . 
You do not like the Prince , Hermione , she added , putting the hamburger in front of the stern girl , because that person was better at poisoning than you - nothing to do with it ! Said Hermione , her cheeks red . I just thought it was irresponsible to do the spell you did not know what it was going to do , and stop talking about the Prince as if it were his title , I bet it was just a stupid nickname . , and he does not seem to be a good person to me ! I do not know where to find out , Harry angry . 
If he was a potential Death Eater , would he not brag about being a hybrid sorcerer ? When he said this , Harry remembered that his father was a pureblood , but he hurried off that thought ; He would think about it after the Death Eaters could not be purebred , not enough purebloods left , " said Hermione stubbornly . I believe most of them pretend to be pureblood . 
Only people born from the Muggle family are hated , they will be happy if you and Ron join . They can not let me become a Death Eater ! - Ron said indignantly , a piece of sausage flying out of the fork it was shoved in front of Hermione and hit the forehead of Ernie Macmillan - Our house has betrayed the breed ! For the Death Eaters , it's just as bad as being born in a Muggle family , and they ' ll love it , " said Harry sarcastically . 
We would be fussy friends if they did not try to kill me like this . This made Ron laugh . 
Even Hermione showed a reluctant smile . 
A distraction appears in Ginny's form . Hey , Harry . 
I have to give you this . It was a scroll of parchment named Harry written above with a slender , familiar text . Thanks , Ginny , that's the next Dumbledore lesson ! Harry said to Ron and Hermione , rolling open the parchment and reading out the contents . on the 2 nd afternoon ! . 
He suddenly felt relieved and happy . Would like to go to Hogsmead with us . 
Ginny ? - he asked . I will go with Dean - meet people there , she replied , waving them and go . 
Elder Filch stood at the front door as usual , marking the names 
allowed to go to Hogsmeade . 
The process lasts longer than ever because Filch checks every 3 times with his secret Sensor . What if we smuggle dark objects out ? Asked Ron , glaring at the crooked Sensitive Thing . Obviously you should check out the things we brought back ! This addiction gives it some sudden sensation of the Sensor . When he went out with the wind and snow , he still grimaced . 
The walk to Hogsmead village is not interesting at all . 
Harry pulled the scarf over his face ; The face reveals itself immediately after becoming numb and frostbitten . 
The road to the village filled with students bunched together before the wind blows . 
More than once , Harry wondered if it would be better to be in the Common Room now , and when they finally reached Hogsmead and saw that the Zonko Shop was sealed On the plank , Harry considered it a confirmation that this trip would not be fun . 
Ron , with a thick gloved hand , entered the Duke's shop , which opened the door wide open , and Harry and Hermione staggered in the footsteps of it into the crowded shop . Thank you , Ron shivered as they were enveloped by the warmth of the toffee . Here afternoon always go to the cup . Harry , son ! - a loud voice from behind them . Alright , Harry muttered . 
The three of them turned around and saw Professor Slughorn , who wore a huge fur hat and a fur coat with fur collar , holding a bag full of pineapple wrapped and occupy at least a quarter of the store . Harry , I missed at least 3 small dinners with me ! Slughorn said , nodding it to his chest . Well , son , I'm determined to have children . 
Miss Granger loves dinners too , right ? Yes , Hermione said desperately , oh , that's really not what , Harry ? Slughorn asked , I have to practice Quidditch , sir , said Harry , it really set the rehearsal every time Slughorn sent it a baby card , adorned with purple ribbons . 
This strategy means Ron will not be abandoned , and they will often have a laugh with Ginny , imagine Hermione being sandwiched between McLaggen and Zabini . 
Oh , I'm sure you ' ll win the first game after all that hard work ! Said Slughorn . " But a little entertainment does not hurt anyone . 
See , Monday night , I can not want to practice in the weather like this I can not , professor . 
I have - ah - an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that afternoon already . Again unfortunate ! Shouted Slughorn . Ah , I can not escape forever , Harry ! With a wave of pride , he whispered out of the store , not paying attention to Ron as if it were a cocker spaniel . 
I can not believe you left again , Hermione said , shaking her head . You know , it's not so bad even if it's fun sometimes . 
But then she saw Ron's expression . Oh , look , they have that kind of luxury hairbrush - those are probably the most new ! Apparently Hermione changed the subject , and Harry seemed to enjoy the more outdated brushes than he would normally do , but Ron continued to look bothered and shrugged just as Hermione asked where she wanted to go next . . Go to the Three Broom Shop , " said Harry , " there will be warmth . They wrap up the scarves on their faces and walk out of the candy store . 
After the sweet warmth of the Secret Duke , some gusts of wind on the small face like 
the blades . Road is not crowded . 
No one lingering chat , only attentively fast legs to stop . 
The only exception is the two men in front of them a little bit , standing in front of the Three Brooms . 
A very tall and thin man ; Squinting through his washed - out glasses , Harry realized that he was the owner of another Hogsmead pub , the Heo's . 
As Harry , Ron , and Hermione got closer , the bar owner tugged on his tight coat collar and walked away , leaving the little man in the arm . 
They were just a few feet away and Harry suddenly realized who he was . Mundungus ! The stubby man with long red hair jumped up and dropped the old suitcase , which came out , revealing what looked like the whole contents of a door window . scrap goods . ' Arry - Mundungus Fletcher says , with an effort to make yourself comfortable not convinced at all . Oh , do not let me miss your business . And he continued on the ground looking for something from the suitcase with a desire to be wrapped away from it immediately . are you selling these things ? " Asked Harry , looking at Mudungus grabbing some kind of dusty stuff , oh , had to earn a meal , Mundungus suddenly shouted . Pay that ! Ron bent down and picked up something of silver . Wait , Ron said slowly , This look familiar . Said Mundungus , grabbing a glass from Ron's hand and stuffing it with his suitcase . Ah , see you guys later - ahhhhh ! Harry grabbed Mundung's neck at the corner of the shop . 
One hand gripping him , he drew his wand . Harry ! Cried Hermione . you steal it from the Sirius uncle ! , Said Harry , his nose almost touching Mundungus ' nose and he inhaled the old cigarette and the spirits were very upset . It has an insignia of the Black family above . What's wrong ? he stuttered , his face gradually turned purple . What did you do , back on the night he died and took everything away ? - Harry roared . 
tuhib .. Answer here ! Harry , you can not ! - hermione screams , Mudungus is always green . 
An explosion echoed , and Harry saw his hand slip from Mundungus's throat . 
Puffed up , Mundungus grabbed his lost suitcase , and - CRACK - he landed . 
Harry whispered a loud voice , turned away and saw Mundungus disappear . come back ! thieves ! I can not do anything , Harry . 
Tonks appeared , dull hair drenched in snow . Mundungus is now in London . 
There was nothing he could steal from Sirius . 
Thief ! Even so , _ Tonk said , it was not completely dissatisfied with this information , so they went into the shop to cool off . She watched them walk through the door of the Three Brooms . 
Just inside , Harry immediately burst out : He steals Sirius's belongings ! ! ! I know , Harry , but do not yell , people look - Hermione whispering . Sit down here , take my drink ! Harry was still angry when Hermione returned to the table a few minutes later with three bottles of avocado . Can not you manage that father ? _ whispered Harry with two angry friends . 
Can not they at least stop rampaging everything that is not locked to the wall in the headquarters ? see ! Said Hermione , looking around to make sure no one was listening ; There were two wizards sitting next to a guy looking at Harry with pleasure , and Zabini was wandering around a pillar far away from them . Harry , if I'm really upset , I know he's stealing Harry's bartender's mouth ; It has for a moment forgotten that it now owns house number 12 , Grimmauld Square . Yes , that's my thing . 
What a pity he does not like to see me . 
Anyway , I ' ll tell Dumbledore this , too , you're the only one who knows what it's all about . " Hermione whispered , obviously pleased to see Harry calm down . Ron , what do you look like ? Nothing - " said Ron , hurriedly away from the bar , but Harry knew it was trying to catch the eye of the attractive , attractive woman , Rosmerta , whom Ron enjoyed long ago . I know nothing about the back of the guy who is taking more bottles of whiskey fire . - Hermione grumbled . 
Ron ignored this sarcasm ; sip its beer beers ; Clearly it was a great silence . 
Harry thought about Sirius , and , what , he also hated some silver mugs . 
Hermione banged her hand on the table , her gaze flickering at Ron and the shopkeeper . 
Harry had just drunk the last drop of it , she said . 
Then I stop here and go back to school ? The other two nodded ; The trip is not fun and the weather is getting worse if they keep lingering . 
Again , the girls tighten tight , adjusting the scarf , followed by Katie Bell and a friend out of the shop , went up the Great Road . 
Harry's thoughts wander about Ginny as they trudge through the frozen snow on the way to Hogwarts . 
They did not meet her , for sure , Harry thought , because she and Dean were sitting quietly in the warmth of Puddifoot Tea Shop , where frequent attendance of happy couples . 
Furiously , he ducked his head away from the pouring snow and continued to trudge . 
A moment later , Harry began to notice the voice of Katie Bell and her friend , who was looking up at them in the wind , had become deaf and loud . 
Harry glances at their unknown shape . 
The girls are arguing about something Katie is holding in her arms . Nothing related to that , Leanne ! - Harry heard Katie say . 
They turn into a small alley ; The snow was thick and fast , making Harry's glasses dim . 
He reached up and wiped his glasses and Leanne suddenly grabbed the package Katie was holding ; Katie snapped and the packet fell to the ground . 
Immediately , Katie flew into the sky , unlike Ron did , hovering over her ankle , which was very charming . 
Her hands were wide , as if she was about to fly really . 
But something is not right here , something is bizarre . Her hair hurls around her with a strong wind , but her eyes are closed and her face does not show any emotion . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione and Leanne both stopped , watching . 
Then , six feet from the ground , Katie gave a scream . Her eyes widened , but whatever she saw , no matter how she felt , clearly hurt her . 
She just screamed and screamed ; Leanne started screaming and grabbing Katie's ankle , trying to bring her back to the ground . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione rushed to help , but when they caught Katie's foot , the little girl fell on top of them ; Harry and Ron caught her but she rolled over so badly they could not keep it . 
Instead , they lowered her to the ground , she thrashed and screamed , apparently not recognizing them . 
Harry looked around ; The scene is empty . here go ! _ harry shouted to the crowd in the wind . I go to find help people . 
It started sprinting toward the school . 
He had never seen anyone act like Katie before so he could not think what he was doing . 
He turned the runner into the turn of the road and crashed into a whisper with something like a giant bear standing . Hagrid ! said Harry , pulling himself out of the fence he had fallen into . 
Har .. ry ! Hagrid said , snow covered his eyebrows and beard , and he was wearing a beige gown of great beard . 
Please visit Grawp , that's too bad , I do not know .. Uncle Hagrid , someone injured there , or cursed , or something ? , Hagrid came down to hear Harry in the violent wind . Some people are charmed ! - Harry roared . do you mind ? 
Who ? ... not Ron or Hermione ? not Kata Bell - this road ! They ran back to that road and did not have any time to find the small group around Katie , who was still rolling and screaming on the ground ; Ron , Hermione and Leanne are trying to keep her quiet . Come back ! - Hagrid shouted - let us take a look ! Something happened to him _ Leanne sobbed - I did not know Hagrid glared at Katie for a second , then did not say anything , bent down to hold her in his arms , ran straight to the castle . 
In just a few seconds , Katie's shudder faded and the only sound left was the screams of the wind . 
Hermione rushed over to the girl who was crying from Katie's face and crossed her arms . You are Leanne , right ? She nodded . Does that happen completely unexpectedly , or ? At that time the package torn Leanne sobs , said hand pointing to the wet brown paper package lying on the ground , now torn 2 to reveal the sparkling blue light . 
Ron bent down , reached out , but Harry clutched his arm and pulled it back . Do not touch ! . 
He bent down , saw a magnificent cat - eye pendant from the pile of paper . I've seen this before ! Said Harry , staring at the object . It was exhibited in Borgins and Burkes years ago . 
The label says it is cursed . 
Certainly Katie has touched it . Harry looked up at Leanne , now starting to tremble . How did Katie get this ? Oh , that's what we're arguing about . 
He came out of the bathroom Three brooms and the handle of this , saying it was a surprise to someone at Hogwarts that he would have to give . 
At the time , he looked so strange . 
Oh , no , no ! 
I bet he was controlled by a spell that I did not recognize ! Leanne suffered another tremor and sobs . 
Hermione clapped her shoulders gently . Does she say who gave that to you , Leanne ? No , he did not say and I said he was stupid and did not bring that thing into school , but he did not , so I grabbed it - and - and Leanne let out a disappointed moan . Let's go back to school , Hermione said , one hand still hanging over Leanne's shoulder . We ' ll know how she is . Harry hesitated for a moment , then took his neck out of his shirt and , panting Ron's face , carefully wrapping the necklace in it and carrying it . We need to give this to Mrs. Promfey - It says Follow the steps Hermione and Leanne go , Harry irritated thinking . 
They just came inside the school yard and it said , can not keep up with the thought for themselves it anymore . 
Malfoy knows this necklace . 
Once in Borgin and Burkes 4 years ago , myself 
Seeing that he enjoyed it when he was hiding his father and him . That's what it was going to buy us to follow ! 
He remembered and turned around to find that . I do not know , Harry - Ron hesitated Many people came in and Borghes Borghes too , with not the other girl said Katie get that in the bathroom ? She said she came back from the bathroom with that , where was she supposed to get that in the bathroom ? " McGonagall ! " Ron warned . 
Harry looked up . 
In fact , Professor McGonagall was swiftly going down the steps , running through the snow to reach them . Hagrid says the four girls saw what happened to Katie Bell - Please up the stairs to her room right ! 
What's up , Potter ? That's what she was touching , Harry said the sky and the earth , Professor McGonagall said , sounded puzzled as she took the necklace from Harry's hand . No , no , filch , they go with me ! she hurriedly added , seeing Filch eagerly crossing the entrance to the hall , holding up his secret Sensor . Take this necklace to Professor Snape , careful not to touch it , keeping it covered with a scarf . Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs to her office . 
The window frames were full of snow , the room was cold , though the fire was ringing in the furnace . 
Professor McGongall closed the door of the room and walked around the table to face Harry , Ron , Hermione and Leanne who had not yet sobbed . So she said sharply , What happened ? As he spoke , confused , and repeatedly stopped trying to restrain his cry , Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had entered the bathroom at Three Brooms and came back with the package , Katie . It seems a little weird , and they have argued about the wisdom of accepting the delivery of strangers , the debate culminated in the seizure of the package , causing it to tear . At this point , Leanne was so dismayed that she could not even speak another word . All right , the professor said , not too coerced , Please go to the clinic , Leanne , and tell Mrs. Pomfrey to give her some medicine to help reduce the emotional . When she was gone , the professor turned to Harry , Ron and Hermione . 
What happens when Katie touches the necklace ? She flew up to the sky , Harry answered , before Ron and Hermione could speak , and then began to scream and dive . 
Professor , can I meet Professor Dumbledore ? The principal comes second , Harry , " Professor Mcgonagall said , looking surprised . are you gone Harry repeated angrily . Yeah , Potter , come on . - Professor McGonagall says harshly . But whatever I want to say about this terrible accident you can tell me , I'm sure ! Within half a second , Harry hesitated . 
Professor McGonagall is not happy about that . 
Dumbledore , though in many respects more terrifying than her , still seems less likely to disregard an opinion , no matter how crazy it is . 
But this is a matter of survival , no time to worry about being ridiculed . Professor , I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie Bell that rope ! On one side of Harry , Ron rubbed his nose confusedly , on the other , Hermione turned her legs as if to make a distance between her and Harry . That's a serious accusation , Potter , she said , after a moment of silence . do you have any proof " No , " said Harry , but she told McGonagall that they had followed Malfoy to Borgins and Brookes and that the conversation between him and Borgin had been eavesdropping on them . 
When it was finished , Professor McGonagall was a little confused . Malfoy brings something to Borgin and Burkes to fix ? No , Professor , it just wanted Borgin to fix something , he did not bring that one with him . 
But that was not the problem , the problem was that at the same time he had bought something , and I thought it was the necklace that saw Malfoy leave the shop with a package like that ? No , ma ' am , he asked Borgin to let him stay in the shop for him _ But Harry , hermione interrupted , Borgin asked Malfoy to bring it along , and Malfoy said no - Said Harry angrily . 
What he really said at that time was : What would I look like if I brought that down ? Said Hermione . Yes , it would look a little like a fool to carry that chain down the road - Ron interrupts Oi Ron - Hermione says in frustration , It's wrapped up well , Malfoy does not need to touch it , and hides it . It's hard on the jacket , no one can see ! 
Anyhow , I thought whatever he bought at Borgin and Bukers would be loud or loud , something he knew would make people notice him when he was down - and in any case - she insisted before Harry interrupted me asked Borgin about that necklace , do you remember ? 
When I came in to try to find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep , I saw the rope there . 
He just said his price , not saying he sold it or anything , it was so obvious , he realized his intentions for 5 seconds , of course he did not tell you Anyway , Malfoy could have asked people to send it home - " Enough ! " Professor McGonagall said , as Hermione furiously opened her mouth to retaliate . This , but we can not blame Malfoy just because it came to the shop where the necklace can be bought there . 
Hundreds of people could be like that - that's what I said - - said Ron . And no matter how , we have tightened our security measures this year . 
She does not believe that the necklace is in the school that we do not know . In addition , McGonagall said , with a decidedly frightening atmosphere , Malfoy was not in Hogsmead's village today . Harry looked at the teacher , rapturously : Professor , how do you know ? Because he was fine with me . 
He did not do the Transformation exercise two times continuously . 
So , thank you for letting me know about your doubts , Potter , she said as she passed them . But now we have to go to the infirmary to check on Katie Bell's situation . 
Have a good day . She kept the door open . 
They have no choice but to queue out of the room without saying a word . 
Harry is madly in love with two of his friends on Professor McGonagall's side ; However , it prompted her to join as soon as the other two started discussing what had happened . 
Who do you think Katie was called to give the necklace ? Asked Ron , as they climbed the stairs to the common room . it's heaven to know _ says Hermione . 
But whoever it is almost died . 
No one can open the package without touching the chain . That could be for a lot of people , _ Harry said . Like Dumbledore , Death Eaters must prefer to die if they are killed by the Master , he is certainly one of their main targets . 
Or Slughorn , Dumbledore said 
Voldemort wanted to have a total and they did not feel good enough to see him on the side of Dumbledore . 
Either you or Hermione said , look worried . No way - Harry said she just turned the turning point and gave it to me , right ? 
I walked backwards just down the street from the Three Broom Shop . 
It would be more reasonable to deliver that package outside of Hogwarts , as Fitch played the one - on - one search . 
I wonder what Malfoy was saying just bringing that to Hogwarts ? Harry , Malfoy is not at Hogwarts ! Said Hermione , really bored . So he might use a mutant , said Harry . 
Crabbe or Goyle , think , or another Death Eater . 
He would have more crooks and coughs than when he'd joined them now - Ron and Hermione exchanged a clear picture of what it means to argue - with - it - too - less - good . " Dilligrout , " Hermione shouted with certainty as they headed for Mrs. Beo . 
The portrait throws themselves out so they can enter the common room . 
The room was full of people and had a damp cloth . 
It seems that many people have left Hogsmead early because of bad weather . 
Even so , there is no noise of anxiety or conjecture ; Clearly information about Katie's fate has not been spread . 
That's not a whimsical attack , really , when you think about it , " said Ron , ejaculating one of the first out of one of the warm benches next to the fireplace to sit down . The curse does not happen inside the castle anymore , so it must be foolish to understand . You're right , " said Hermione , taking Ron's foot off the chair and giving it to her first . 
That plan is not well calculated . But when did Malfoy become one of the most well - informed ? Neither Ron nor Hermione answered it . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 13 The secret riddle 
Katie was transferred to St . Mungo's Hospital for Wounds and Traumatic Infections the following day , at which time news of her being hit by a spell had spread throughout the school , though details remained . Harry and Ron , Hermione , and Leanne seem to know that Katie herself is not the original target . Oh , and certainly Malfoy knows , Harry told Ron and Hermione , while they continued their deafening policy whenever Harry mentioned the Malfoy - Deathly Hallows theory . Death . 
Harry wondered if Dumbledore had come back from the place where he had come for Monday night classes , but without seeing what he said , he still came to Dumbledore's office at eight o ' clock , knocked on the door , and called in . There Dumbledore sat with unusually fatigue ; His hand was still as black as before , but he still laughed when he raised Harry's hand to sit down . 
The Sign appears on the table , shining silver dots on the ceiling . I had a very busy time when I was away , Dumbledore said . I believe you have witnessed Katie accidentally . 
Yes , sir . 
How is she ? It was still very bad , though she was very lucky . 
She seemed to have touched the necklace with the smallest possible ; There is a very small hole in the glove . 
If she wears a ring , if she holds the ring with her bare hands , she may be dead , even instantly . 
Fortunately , Professor Snape has done enough to prevent the spread of the charm . Why is he ? Harry asked immediately . Why not Mrs. Pomfrey ? Insolently , a slight voice came from one of the portraits on the wall , and Sirius ' Phineas Nigellus Black , raised his head from his hand , where he seemed to be sleeping . I would never accept a student asking how Hogwarts was managed in my day . Yes , thank you , Phineas , Dumbledore said repressively . Professor Snape knew more about Dark Arts than Harry Pomfrey . 
Anyway , staff at St . Mungo's Hospital are sending us hourly reports and I hope that she will be able to recover completely . Where are you last week ? Harry asked , despite the strong feeling that it was pushing his luck too far , a feeling that Phineas Nigellus was obviously experiencing , and that he was breathing lightly . I will not say right now , Dumbledore said . But I will tell you the most reasonable . Will you tell me ? Said Harry , his voice trembling . Yes , I suppose so , Dumbledore said , taking out a stream of light gleaming silver from within the cloak and releasing it with a slight waving wand . Harry , I met Mundungus in the village of Hogsmeade . Well , yes , we realize that Mundungus has responded to his inheritance with some vicious snob actions , Dumbledore said , a little angry . He had been to the house since he had talked with him outside the Three Tree Shoppers ; I thought he was afraid to face me . 
Anyway , rest assured that he will not be able to escape with any of Sirius property anymore . That filthy male has stolen the Black lineage ? Phineas Nigellus said , furiously ; and he got out of his painting , certainly to his portrait at 12 , Grimmauld Square . Sir , Harry said , after a brief pause , Professor McGonagall told the teacher what I told him after Katie's injury ? 
About Draco Malfoy ? You told me about your doubts , Dumbledore said . What's up ? We will consider all the best measures to investigate anyone involved in Katie's accident , Dumbledore said . But what we care about now is our lesson , Harry . Harry felt a bit uncomfortable about this : If their lessons are really important , why is there a very long time between the first and second lesson ? 
Anyway , it did not say a word about Draco Malfoy , but just watched as Dumbledore poured new memories into the Sign and began to turn the stone pot once again with his long hands . myself . You will still remember , I am sure , that we have stopped the story of the beginning of Lord Voldemort at a time when a handsome Muggle , Tom Riddle , abandoned his wives wife , Merope . , and returned to the family home in Little Hangleton . 
Merope was left alone in London , waiting for the birth of a child that someday would become Lord Voldemort . Why did he know her in London , mister ? 
Because there is evidence of Caractacus Burke , Dumbledore said , who , with a strange coincidence , helped find the semi - circular shop that we had just discussed earlier . He mixed the solution in the sign like Harry had seen several times before , like a gold platter looking for gold particles . At the top of the vortex , a silver mass accostises a small man spinning slowly in the sign , white as a ghost , but more dense , with a full shimmer fill his eyes . 
Yes , we have it in very curious cases . 
It was just before Christmas , a young sorceress , oh , of course many years ago . 
She said that she needed gold money , umm , that was too obvious . 
Covered by rags and quite far over There will be one child , see . 
She said that the locket was once owned by Slytherin . 
Let's see , we do not always hear such stories , ' Oh , this one of Merlin , it was his favorite teapot , ' but when we look at it , it's true . His stamps , and some simple spells are enough to tell us what the truth is . 
Of course that makes it almost invaluable . 
She did not know how worth it . 
Satisfying 10 Galleons for it , is the most vocal bargain we have ever made ! Dumbledore shook the pot even more and Caractacus Burke sank into the circular mass of memory where he appeared . Did he just give you 10 Galleons ? Harry resented . Caractacus Burke is not known for his generosity , Dumbledore said . 
So we know that , during his late pregnancy , Merope was alone in London and needed gold , and needed to sell his only valuable asset , the locket that had been Marvolo's legacy . But you can use magic ! Harry lacked composure . Can you have food and everything you want with magic ? Well , Dumbledore said , maybe she has that ability . 
But as I think - I just guess , but I'm sure I'm right - that when her husband left , Merope stopped using magic . 
I do not think she wants to continue to be a witch . 
Of course , it is also possible that unrequited love and great frustration have drained the magic away from her ; That could be too . 
But in any case , like you would see , Merope refused to raise his wand even to save her own life . Can not you live for your son ? Dumbledore raised his eyebrows . Can you feel the pain of Lord Voldemort ? No , Harry answered quickly , but she had a choice , which , unlike her mother's mother , had a choice , Dumbledore said mildly . Yes , Merope Riddle chose death for her child in need , but do not judge too harshly , Harry . 
She was very weak by long - term suffering and she did not have the courage of her mother . 
And now if you could stand up Where would we go ? Harry asked as Dumbledore stood with him at the table . This time , Dumbledore said , we will go into our memory . 
I think you will find it very detailed and accurate . 
Harry walks down to Harry ; Its face touches the surface of the memory block and then it falls into the darkness . A few seconds later , its feet land on the hard ground ; He opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a London street , sneering and old . 
I'm there , Dumbledore said cheerfully , pointing at them in a tall figure crossing the street in front of a dairy truck depicting a horse . 
Albus Dumbledore's long hair and beard are yellowish brown . Having reached this side of the street , he took a quick step on the sidewalk , drawing many curious glances at the plum - colored velvet gown he was wearing . That beautiful shirt , Harry said before he could stop himself , but Dumbledore just smiled as they followed his young copy at a distance , finally going through a flood of doors . iron to a fibrous courtyard , standing in front of a block - shaped building , surrounded by high barriers . 
He stepped a few steps to the front door and knocked once . 
After a few short moments , the door was opened by a slut girl wearing aprons . Hello 
Do you have an appointment with Mrs. Cole , who I believe is your manager ? Oh , the little girl was confused , telling Dumbledore's strange look . I'm waiting for a COLE ! she shouted behind her back . 
Harry heard a reply from somewhere far away . 
The girl returned to Dumbledore . Come in , the mistress is coming . Dumbledore enters a corridor paved by black and white ; This place is all shabby but clean without dust . 
Harry and the older Dumbledore stepped forward . 
Before the door closed behind them , a thin woman , seeming to be upset , stepped quickly toward them . 
She had a very sharp expression that seemed to express anxiety rather than lack of hospitality , and she was speaking behind with another servant , also wearing an apron , as she walked toward Dumbledore . 
And take up the bottle of iodine up Martha always , Billy Stubbs the flakes on the ball , and Eric Whalley burst into the bed - treatment of chickenpox is above all , she did not tell a specific person , then the eye She stopped at Dumbledore , and she stopped , surprised as if a giraffe had just entered her house . Hello , Dumbledore said , hands clasped together . 
Mrs. Cole still gasped . My name is Albus Dumbledore . 
I sent her a letter asking for permission to meet and she was kind enough to invite me to come here today . And Cole blinked . 
Apparently she was sure that Dumbledore was not an illusion , she whispered , oh yes . 
Then you should go to my room more . right . She led Dumbledore to a small room that was probably half the room , half her office . 
It was as bad as the corridor , and the furniture was old and lacking in food . 
She invited Dumbledore to sit down on a rickety chair , and left herself behind a cluttered desk , watching him restlessly . I'm here , as mentioned in the letter , to talk about Tom Riddle and arrange for his future , Dumbledore said . Are you a family member ? asked Cole . No , I'm a teacher , Dumbledore said . I came to give Tom a place in my school . What is the field ? It's called Hogwarts , says Dumbledore . Why are you so interested in Tom ? We believe it has the qualities we are looking for . Are you saying it has a scholarship ? 
How did it get ? 
Has it ever been registered for a scholarship ? Um , its name was sent to our school as soon as it was born Who signed up for it ? 
His parents ? There is no denying that Mrs. Cole is such a shrewd person . 
Apparently Dumbledore thought too , for Harry saw him pulling the wand out of his velvet dress and , at the same time , took a blank piece of paper on her desk 
Cole . Here , Dumbledore said , waving his wand once when he handed her the paper , I believe this would explain everything . Mrs. Cole lost focus and then stared at the white paper for a long time . Everything was so well organized , she whispered , handing it back to him . 
Then her eyes stopped at a bottle of gin and two glasses that were definitely not there a few seconds ago . Oh , I invite you a glass of gin ? she said in a rather polite tone . Thank you very much , Dumbledore happy . 
Sooner or later we can see that Cole is not naive about drinking . 
Pouring two glasses full of alcohol , she drank her portion in one breath . 
Licking her lips comfortably , she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time that day , and he did not hesitate to use her superiority . I wonder if you can tell me the story of Tom Riddle's life ? 
I think it was born in this orphanage right ? That's right , Mrs. Cole said , pouring herself a glass of wine . I remember it as well as other things , because at that moment I just opened this orphanage . New Year's Eve , cold bones , and snow again , you know . 
A bad night . 
And that girl , who was not much older than me , staggered at the front door . 
Actually , she was not the first . 
I put her in , and helped her an hour later . 
She died an hour later . Mrs. Cole nodded and took another sip of wine . What did she say before she died ? Asked Dumbledore . Is there something related to the boy's father , for example ? Now , if that were the case , she would have said , Mrs. Cole seemed content with herself , with a glass of wine in her hand and a passionate listener with her story . I remember that she said to me , ' I hope it's like three of them , ' and I'm not lying , she was right in that expectation , because she was not pretty at all - and she said He would be named Tom , like his father , and Marvolo , like her father - right , I know , that funny name is not it ? 
We wondered if she came from a circus - and she said the baby's last name was Riddle . 
Then she died without saying a word . So we named it as she said , it seemed very important to the poor girl , but no Tom or Marvolo or any Riddle to find it , no family . Anyway , it stayed in the orphanage from now on . Mrs. Cole poured herself a glass of wine , almost unconditionally . 
Two pink notes appeared on her cheeks . 
Then she said , it was a funny boy . Yes , Dumbledore said . I thought it would be . He was also a happy kid . 
She never cried . 
But then , as it grows up , it's very weird . How strange ? Asked Dumbledore gently . Hmmm , but Mrs. Cole stopped immediately , and there was no dull or careless glance at the judgment she threw at Dumbledore through her wine glass . It would have been a place in your school , he said ? Definitely , Dumbledore said . And what can I say can not be changed ? Nothing , Dumbledore said . 
Can you take it , no matter what ? Regardless of what , Dumbledore recalled his seriousness . 
She glanced at him as if deciding whether to trust him or not . 
Obviously , she decided that yes , because she said immediately , It made other children afraid . Did you say it was a thug ? Asked Dumbledore . I think it may be , Mrs. Cole said , a bit serious , but it is hard to see it in such cases . There is evidence of strange things Dumbledore did not urge her , though Harry could tell he was attracted . 
She took another sip of wine and her cheeks blushed redder . Billy Stubbs's rabbit , well , Tom said he did not do it , and I did not know how he did it , but anyway , rabbit can not hang himself on the beams anyway ? I do not think so , can not , Dumbledore said quietly . But I'm crazy if I know how to get on it . All I knew was that it was with Billy or the other day . 
And then Mrs. Cole took a sip of wine , scraping a little of her chin , during the summer break , we let the kids out , you know , once a year , to the countryside or to the beach . The sea - see , Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were not normal after that , and all we heard from them was that the boys were with Tom in the cave . 
He swore they were just going to go exploring , but something happened in the cave , I'm sure . 
And again , there are a lot of other things , very funny . She looked around at Dumbledore again , and although her cheeks were already red , her gaze was sure . I do not think that many people will regret seeing their back . You will understand that , I'm sure , we do not keep it constant , Dumbledore said . He will come back , at least , every summer vacation . Well , that's better than being hit in the face by a dirty rod , Cole says in a slight hiccup . 
She stood up , and Harry was surprised to see she could still stand , even though two - thirds of the bottle was gone . I suppose he wants to see the boy ? Very pleased , Dumbledore said , also stood up . 
She took him out of the office and went to a stone staircase , giving instructions and rebuking the servants and the children as she passed . 
The orphans , as Harry saw them , were wearing the same gray uniform . 
They seem to be very well looked after , but it is undeniable that this is a harsh place to grow up . Here , Mrs. Cole said , as they turned to the second zone and stopped in front of a door in a long corridor . 
She knocked two and walked in . Tom ? I have visitors to this . this is Mr. Dumberton - sorry , Dunberbore . 
He came to tell me that I would let him speak for himself . Harry and both Dumbledore entered the room , and Mrs. Cole closed the door behind them . It was a small empty room except for an old wardrobe and an iron bed frame . The baby is sitting on a gray blanket , his legs spread out in front to hold a book . 
There is no sign of the Gaunt family on Tom Riddle's face . 
Merope had the last wish before dying : It looked handsome , fairly tall at age 11 , with black hair , and a pale ear . 
His eyes narrowed as he saw the strange look of Dumbledore . 
There was a moment of silence . Hello , Tom ? Said Dumbledore , stepping forward and raising his hand . 
The boy hesitated , then took it , they shook hands . 
Dumbledore opened the hard wooden chair next to the Riddle , the two of them looking like the sick and the sick . I am Professor Dumbledore . Professor ? Said Riddle . 
It seems to be a precaution . Is there a ' doctor ' ? 
What are you doing here ? 
Did she let him in to see me ? She pointed to the door where Mrs. Cole had just left . No , no , Dumbledore smiled . I do not believe you , Riddle said . Does she want to see me ? 
Be honest ! It says the last three words with the force that makes one choke . It was an order , and it was uttered as if he had said so many times . 
His eyes glared at Dumbledore , meanwhile , did not react at all but continued to laugh intimately . 
After a few seconds , the Riddle was no longer glazed , though it sounded cautious . 
Who are you ? I told you already . 
My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts . 
I come to give you a place to study in my new school , if you want to go there . Riddle's reaction to this event was unexpected . 
He slipped off the bed and stepped back from Dumbledore , looking very angry . You can not trick me ! 
The madhouse is where you work ? ' Professor , well , do not we go , see ? 
That old cat must go to the madhouse . 
I do not do anything small Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop , and you can ask them , they ' ll tell you ! I did not come from the camp , Dumbledore said calmly . I'm a teacher , and if you sit down , I ' ll tell you about Hogwarts . 
Of course if you do not want to go to school , then no one will force you to see me . I want to see how they try to force me to look , Riddle growled . Hogwarts , Dumbledore continues to say , as if he did not hear the last words of Riddle , a school for special talented children . I'm not crazy ! I know you are not crazy . 
Hogwarts is not a school for crazy people . that is the school of magic . There is a silence . 
Riddle froze there , his face without any emotion , but his eyes moved between Dumbledore's eyes , trying to prove that one of them was lying . Magic ? she asked in a whisper . That's right , Dumbledore said . that's magic , what can you do ? What do you do ? Everything , Riddle gasped . 
An excited blood rose from his neck to his cheeks , it seemed very moving . You can make the sheets fly without having to touch them . 
You can send animals without teaching anything . 
You can make those who upset you bad things . 
You can hurt them if you want to . its legs tremble . 
He tripped forward and sat down on his bed , looking at his hands , his head bowing down as if he was praying . 
I know you are different from everyone , he whispered into his fingers . I know you are special . 
Always , I know there is something right , you're right , Dumbledore said , though not laughing anymore , but staring at Riddle . 
You are a witch . 
Riddle raised his head . 
Its face is bright : There is a strong happiness on it , but for some reason it still does not make it more attractive ; On the contrary , its austere expression seems more ferocious , almost as venomous . Are you also a witch ? yes , i am a witch . Prove it , Riddle said right away , with the same command tone as it had ever used . Tell the truth . Dumbledore raised his eyebrows . If , as I think , you accept Hogwarts School of course I accept ! Then you must call me ' Professor ' or ' Teacher ' . Riddle's expression stiffened for a moment before he spoke , with an unmistakable accent , I apologize to you . I mean , Professor , can you show me ? Harry was certain that Dumbledore would refuse , that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of opportunities to perform magic at Hogwarts , that they were in a Muggle - dominated building and therefore could be spotted . present . 
But most unexpectedly , Dumbledore pulled his magic stick out of his pocket , pointing to the shabby closet in the corner , and tapping one . 
The cabinets burned up . 
Riddle jumped up ; Harry could not blame him for screaming in fear and shock ; All its properties are in it . 
But as soon as Riddle hugged Dumbledore , the flames disappeared , leaving a closet full of scratches . 
Riddle stares at the closet and reaches Dumbledore ; Then , full of desire , it points to the wand . Where can I have one ? That's right , Dumbledore said . I think there is something that wants to get out of my closet . And very clearly , there is a small chunk of embers that can be heard coming out of the closet . 
For the first time , Riddle seemed frightened . Open the door , Dumbledore said . 
Riddle hesitated , then ran over and opened the door of the closet . At the top of the stool , on a strip of old clothes , a box of cicadas was wobbling and crying as if there were crazy mice locked in . Get it out , Dumbledore said . 
Riddle took the box that was shaking . 
It seems hesitant . Is there something in the box that you are not allowed to have ? Asked Dumbledore . 
Riddle throws a clear , judgmental look at Dumbledore . Yes , I guess so , mister , in the end it says with a lethargic tone . Open it up , Dumbledore said . 
The riddle opens and the contents of the box go to bed without looking at them . 
Harry , waiting for something more interesting , saw a flood of small things used daily : a yo yo , a silver ring , and a dirty mint in the middle . 
As soon as they got out of the box , they shook and rested on the thin blanket . I will return to their master with an apology , Dumbledore said calmly , stuffing the wand into his jacket . I will know whether it is done or not . 
And notice that : Stealing is not accepted at Hogwarts . Riddle was not troubled ; He was staring at Dumbledore coldly and pondering . 
Finally , he spoke in an indifferent tone , Yes , mister . At Hogwarts , Dumbledore continues , " We are not only teaching you how to use magic , but how to control it . 
I have , unfortunately , I know , use the ability 
In a way that will not be taught or allowed to use at Hogwarts . 
I am not the first , nor will I be the last , to accept the escapist with me . 
But you must know that Hogwarts can expel students , and the Ministry of Magic - well , there is a Ministry - will punish those who break the rules even more terrible . 
All new witches must accept that , when they enter our world , they must obey the law . Yes , master , Riddle said . 
It is difficult to predict what it is thinking ; Its face was almost insensitive as it placed the stolen stuff in the cardboard box . 
When it's done , it turns to Dumbledore saying urgently , I do not have a penny . That's easy , Dumbledore said , pulling out a small bag of leather from his pocket . There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who need help with the purchase of books and robes . 
You may have to buy some magazines and used items , but where can you buy the magazines ? Riddle interrupted , grabbed a heavy bag of money without even thanks to Dumbledore , and was now considering a large gold Galleon . At Red Cross , Dumbledore said . I have a list of the books and the tools you need here . 
Can you help me find everything you come with me ? Riddle looked up . Of course , if you do not need , Riddle said . I've been used to doing everything myself , always walking around London without anyone's guidance . 
How can you go to this Alley ? he asked , looking into Dumbledore's eyes . 
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist on going with Riddle , but again he was surprised . Dumbledore gave Riddle the envelope containing the catalog of supplies needed , and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Cauldron from the orphanage , he said , you will see it , though the Muggles Around the children - those who have no magic - can not . 
Ask Tom the waitress - easy to remember , because he's the same name as you . Riddle snorted uncomfortably , like trying to chase a disturbed fly . Do not you like the name Tom ? There are so many Tom , Riddle grumbled . 
Then it seemed as if it could not stop the question , just as it automatically sprung out of the boy himself , he asked , Is your father a witch ? 
My father's name is Tom Riddle , I'm told that . I'm afraid I do not know that , Dumbledore said , soft voice . Your mother can not have magic , otherwise she will not lose , says Riddle , more to himself than to Dumbledore . 
That's probably him . 
So , when you have your stuff , when do you go to Hogwarts ? All the details are in the second sheet of goat skin in your envelope , Dumbledore said . I will leave here at the King's Cross station on September 1 . 
There is a train ticket in there . Riddle nodded . 
Dumbledore stood up and raised his hand again . 
Take it , Riddle says , You can talk to the snake . 
I found out when I went camping out to the suburbs - they found me , whispered to me . Is that normal for a witch ? Harry could tell that he had kept quiet about the most exotic possibility up to this point , to impress . That is not normal , Dumbledore said , after a moment of hesitation . But that is not yet there . His voice was calm . The eyes moved curiously to Riddle's face . 
They stood there for a moment , a man and a boy , staring at each other . 
Then they let go of each other , Dumbledore to the door . Goodbye Tom . 
I will see you again at Hogwarts . I think that's enough , Dumbledore's silver haired boy next to Harry said , and a few seconds later , the two of them soared into the darkness without weighing again , before settling firmly into the current office . . Sit down , Dumbledore said , sitting down next to Harry . 
Harry followed , his mind still at what he just saw . He believed it faster than me , I mean , when he told her he was a witch , Harry said . At first I did not trust Hagrid , when I told you . Yes , Riddle was completely ready to believe it - to use the word - ' special , ' says Dumbledore . Do you know ? Asked Harry . Do you know that we've just met the most dangerous Black Magician of all time ? Said Dumbledore . No , I did not know that it would become as it is today . 
Anyway , I was curious . 
I returned to Hogwarts , intending to keep an eye on it , something I would have to do in any case , since it was completely lonely and not friends , but immediately , I felt I had to do it . because of others . 
Its ability , as I heard it , was suddenly developed in the boy's body and - most interesting and ominous - it discovered that it could control itself in some way . , and has started using it as desired . 
And as you see , they are not sudden phenomena like those of other witchcraft : It has used magic against others , to frighten , to punish , to control . 
Little stories about a rabbit hung up , and about two kids he tricked into the cave explained most clearly : ' You can make them hurt if you want to . ' And he speaks the tongue , Harry interrupts . horizontal . Right ; a rare possibility , and it must have been related to the Dark Arts , although as we know there are people who are linguists in bad people and good people . 
In fact , the ability to talk to its snakes does not make us feel as uncomfortable as its apparent instincts of cruelty , secrecy and dominance . Time has teased us again , Dumbledore said , pointing to the dark sky outside the window . But before we break up , we want you to pay attention to some of the features of the scenes we just witnessed , as they will explain many of the things we will discuss in our encounters . 
First , I want you to notice Riddle's reaction when we mention another person of the same name , ' Tom ' . Harry nodded . It is its reaction to despise anything between it and the others , anything that makes it more normal . 
Even then , it wished to become independent , unusual , and infamous . 
He dropped his name , as you know , within a few years of the conversation and created the Lord Voldemort that had been there for a long time . I also believe you have noticed that Tom Riddle is qualified , secretive , and clearly has no friends . 
He did not want me to help him or at least go with him to Alley Cross . 
He likes to act alone . 
Big Voldemort too . 
I will hear many Death Eaters saying that they are in his trust , that they are very close to him , even understand his heart . 
They were fooled . 
Lord Voldemort never had a friend , or I believe he never wanted to . And finally - I hope you're not too sleepy to be able to focus on this , Harry - Tom Riddle kids like to collect the spoils . 
I saw the box that kept the stolen items in the room . These are the things that come from the victims of their thugs , the gifts , if you like them , from the unpleasant parts of magic . 
Remember that the wicked tendency , especially these expressions , will be very important later . 
Now , it's time to go to bed . Harry stood up . 
As it passed to the other side of the room , his eyes stopped on the table where Marvolo Gaunt's ring was there the previous time he saw it , but the ring was no longer there . What is Harry ? Dumbledore said , for Harry stood there for a moment . Where the ring was , Harry looked around . But I think you have to have evil or something . Dumbledore beamed at Harry , looking over the top of his moon glass . That's fine , Harry , but the trumpet is just a trumpet . And after that mysterious word he waved to Harry , knowing that it was the order to leave . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 14 Felix Felicis 
Harry had herbal medicine the next morning . 
He did not have the chance to tell Ron and Hermione about the night before with Dumbledore at breakfast for fear of eavesdropping , but it was summed up as the kids walked through the small vegetable garden to the glass house . . 
The cruel winds last weekend have passed ; The mysterious fog has returned and this has given the kids more time to find the right house . Wow , scary , the - who - knows - who - is - Ron , quietly speaking as they sat around a bony Snargaluff root - the subject of this semester , and began to pull . protective gloves . But I still do not understand why Dumbledore gave you all that . I mean , it's very interesting , but what is it ? Did not know , said Harry , tucked into a sticky guard . But all that said is very important and it will help me survive . I think it is very attractive , Hermione said earnestly . It is right to know Voldemort as much as possible . 
If not , then how do you know his weakness ? What about Slughorn's closest party ? Harry hardly asked through the rubber guard . 
Oh , it was quite fun , really , Hermione said , now wearing protective glasses . I mean , he's got a lot of good things to say about it , and he just wanted to take McLaggen's heart because he was a close relative , but he gave us a good meal and he introduced us . with Gwenog Jones . Gwenog Jones ? Asked Ron , his eyes wide behind the protective glasses . Gwenog Jones ? captain of Holyhead Harpies ? That's right , Hermione said . I think she's too proud of me , but there's enough chat in there ! Professor Sprout said in a loud voice , running to look very strict . You guys are following , everyone has started , Neville also had the first cocoon then ! They looked around ; Sure enough , there Neville was sitting with his bleeding lips and a few scratches on one of his cheeks , but his hands were clutching a hard , pale blue , grape size . Yes , Professor , we start right here ! Ron whispered as she turned to them , we would use Muffliato , Harry . No we do not ! Hermione said at once , looking , always , incredibly angry at the thought of the Prince and his spells . 
Should we get started ? She looked at the other two ; Then the little ones took a deep breath and put their hands in the bony roots in between them . 
He suddenly moved ; Long thorns piled high on top and swooped in the air . 
One was caught in Hermione's hair , and Ron brushed it off with a pruning shear ; Harry succeeded in getting some fringes and bunching them up ; a hole appeared in the middle of this tentacle tree branch ; Hermione thrust her hands into the hole with courage , now like a trap around her elbow ; Harry and Ron pulled together the very strong tassels , trying to get the hole open again , and Hermione pulled her hand out , holding a cocoon like Neville's . 
Immediately , the fringes came back in , and the bony root sat there like a timeless log . " You know , I do not think I'm going to plant a tree in my garden when I have a house , " said Ron , pulling a protective glass over his forehead and wiping his sweat from his face . " Give me the bowl , " said Hermione , holding the cone up from the top ; Harry took out one and she dropped the cocoon into it with a disgust on her face . " Do not be discouraged , squeeze it out , they are best when fresh ! " Professor Sprout called to him . " Anyway , " said Hermione , continuing the unfinished story of the little wood that had not attacked yet , " Slughorn's going to have a Christmas party , Harry , and he can not . Hiding from this time because he asked me what time he was empty , so he can open the party in the evening that he can attend . " Harry grunted . 
In the meantime , Ron , trying to squeeze the cocoon in the bowl with both his hands , stood up and squeezed as hard as he could , saying angrily , " And it's a party just for Slughorn's favorite ? "" Just for the Slug Club , yes , " said Hermione . 
The cocoon popped out of Ron's arms and shot into the glass of the house , bouncing back into Professor Sprout's neck and dropping her old hat , patch and patch . 
Harry goes back to the cocoon ; When it came back , Hermione was saying , " See , I did not propose the name of the ' Slug Club ' ... " " Slug Club , " Ron repeated in Malfoy's growling voice . . " Lin forestry is real . 
Okay , I hope both of you like the party . 
Why do not you guys get together with McLaggen , so that Slughorn can call you the King and the Queen Slug ... "" We're allowed to bring you , " said Hermione , becomes red , " and I had intended to invite you , but if you think it is stupid , I do not bother anymore ! " Harry suddenly wished the cocoon was a little far away , so that he would not have to sit here with the two of them . 
Not being noticed by the two , he hugged the bowl containing the cocoon and began trying to separate it in the loudest and most powerful way he could even think ; Unfortunately , it is still possible to hear every word of the conversation . " Are you going to invite me ? " Asked Ron , in a different voice . 
" Yes , " said Hermione furiously . " But obviously you want me to make friends with McLaggen ... " There was a moment of silence as Harry continued to clench the coyote with a shovel . " No , I do not want that , " Ron said softly . 
Harry slipped out of the cocoon , slamming into the broken bowl . " ' Reparo , ' " he said quickly , pointing at the broken pieces with his wand , and the bowl came back . 
The breakdown , however , showed Ron and Hermione the presence of Harry . 
Hermione was very confused and immediately flushed over to see her book " The Worlds Meat Factories " to find out how to snarl the snargaluff tree ; On the other hand , Ron seems embarrassed , but also very satisfied with himself . " Take Harry , " said Hermione hurriedly . " It says we have to poke them with something sharp ... " Harry handed the cocoon in the bowl to her ; he and Ron put on safety glasses and padded their hands , again , into the roots . 
It was not unexpected , Harry thought , as he wrestled with the thread to catch his throat ; It had a notion that this would sooner or later happen . 
But it does not know how it feels ... 
Cho and Cho were too embarrassed to look at each other , silent had nothing to say to each other ; If Ron and Hermione were dating , then why break up ? 
Will their friendship be restored ? 
Harry remembered the few weeks in the third year that they had not talked to each other ; It does not want to be the bridge between the two . 
And then , if they do not break up ? 
If they become like Bill and Fleur , and it will be extremely embarrassing to go with them , so it's better to withdraw . " Catch you ! " Shouted Ron , pulling a second cocoon out of the tree roots while Hermione smashed the first one , now the bowl filled with wrinkled tubes like blue worms . re . 
The remaining minutes of the session went on without a word about Slughorn's party . 
Although Harry had been scrutinizing his two best friends for the past few days , Ron and Hermione did not seem to be anything but their little more polite than usual . 
Harry assumed that it would have to wait to see what would happen under the effect of butter beers in Slughorn's dimly lit room on the night of the party . 
In the meantime , however , it has more urgent concerns . 
Katie Bell is still in St . Mungo's hospital without any sign of leaving the hospital , which means that the promising Gryffindor team that Harry had been practicing very carefully since September lacks a Charm . 
She still retires to replace Katie in the hope she will recover , but the opening match with Slytherin is approaching , and finally she has to accept the fact that she will not be able to return to the match . 
Harry does not think that he can endure a full house test . 
With a sense of lack of relevance to Quidditch , she encounters Dean Thomas after the Transfiguration one day . 
Most classrooms have already left , although some golden sparrows are still flying in the room , all of Hermione's products ; No one succeeds in transforming into a hair from the air . " Do you like playing at the Fellowship ? " " Fish ... ? 
Yes , of course ! " Dean said enthusiastically . Behind Dean , Harry saw Seamus Finnegan throwing his book in his pocket , looking very upset . 
One of the reasons Harry did not want to ask Dean about the team was because he knew Seamus would not like it . 
On the other hand , he had to do his best for the team , and Dean overtook Seamus in his practice sessions . " Then you came in , " said Harry . " Have a practice tonight , 7 hours . " 
" Okay , " Dean said . " Have fun , Harry ! 
God , I can not wait to tell Ginny ! " Then it leapt out of the room , leaving Harry and Seamus together , the uneasy moment also not quenching when a droppable fell on Seamus's head as a Hermione's canary flew over their heads . 
Seamus is not the only one to be irritated with the choice of a replacement for Katie . 
There were a lot of whispers in the common room about the fact that Harry had picked two of his classmates into the team . 
But Harry had been a bit more whispered during this time in school , so it was not troubling , but anyhow , the pressure increased with the victory over Slytherin in the match . to come 
If Gryfindor wins , Harry knows that the whole House will forget the promises and swear they always think the home team is a great team . 
If they lose ... 
Harry thought bitterly , he would have to take another whisper ... 
Harry had no reason to regret when he saw Dean fly that night ; He played very well with Ginny and Demelza . 
The Gunners , Peakes and Coote , are always on the move . 
The only problem is Ron . 
Harry knew that Ron was very unstable , always suffering from psychological attacks and lack of confidence , and unfortunately , the sight of the next match pulled back all the uncertainties . 
After putting in half a dozen points , much of it from Ginny , his method of playing is getting increasingly rough , until it punches Demelza Robins into the mouth . " It was an accident , I'm sorry , Demelza , really sorry ! " shouted Ron as she flew to the ground , blood splattered all over . " I just ... " " That's too bad , " Ginny said angrily , descending to Demelza and checking her swollen lips . " You stupid Ron , look at her in this state ! " " He cured that , " said Harry , lowering the two girls , pointing the wand to Demelza's mouth and saying " Episkey . " " And Ginny , do not call Ron an idiot , I'm not the captain ... "" Hmm , I'm too busy to call him a fool and I think someone should ... " Try not to burst into laughter . " Come on , everyone , let's go ... " Overall , it was the worst rehearsal for a full semester , although Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy as they approached . to the match . " Very good people , I think we can beat Slytherin , " it encourages , and the Cursed Immortals leave the dressing room looking very happy to themselves . " I play like a box of dragon dung , " said Ron in a hollow voice as the door closed behind Ginny . " No , " said Harry firmly . " You're the best guy I've ever chosen Ron . 
Your only problem is psychology . " He continued to cheer on the way to the castle , and when they reached the second floor , Ron was happy . 
When Harry opened the embroidered tapestry to take the shortcut , they went to Gryffindor Tower , they saw Dean and Ginny , they were hugging each other and kissing so hard like they were glueing them together . It was like there was something big and big that was burning in Harry's stomach , scratching inside it : hot blood like it was rising in the brain , making every thought ebbed away and being Superseded by the barbarian desire to cast Dean into a jar . struggling with sudden anger , he heard Ron's voice as if from a distance . " Oh my god ! " Dean and Ginny let go and looked around . " What ? " Ginny said . 
" I do not want to see you kissing people in public ! " " But this is an empty corridor until you come in ! " Ginny said . 
Dean looks very awkward . 
He threw Harry a reckless smile that Harry did not respond to , as if the demon had just born in his heart was screaming the idea of ​​ chasing Dean out of the team immediately . 
" Well ... let's go Ginny , " Dean said , " we're back to the common room ... " " Go away ! " Ginny said . " I want some words with my dear brother ! " Dean left , as if he had no regrets escaping from the play . " That's it , " Ginny said , wiping her long red hair away from her face and staring at Ron , " make it clear once and for all . go with someone or do something , Ron ... "" Oh yeah ! " said Ron , also angry . " What do you think I want you to call me ? " " What ? " Ginny shouted , raising her wand . " What exactly is it ? " " It does not matter , Ginny ... " Harry said automatically , even though the demon in it still screamed in agreement with Ron . " Oh he does ! " She said , scowling at Harry . " Just because he has never been hugged , just because the best kiss he has is Aunt Muriel's ... " " Shut up ! " Ron growled , his face crossing the red threshold and turning . turn purple . " No way ! " Ginny shouted at her side . " I saw you with Phlegm , wishing she kissed me on the cheek every time I saw him , so poor ! 
If you are dating and hugging someone , you will never be bothered to see someone else do that ! " Ron pulled out his wand too , Harry hurried in between them . " You do not know what you're talking about ! " Ron screamed , trying to pick a location to easily attack Ginny around Harry , as he was standing in front of the girl with his arms wide open . " Just because you do not want to do that in public ... ! " Ginny yelled with a mocking laugh , trying to push Harry out of sight . " Kiss Pigwidgeon , lord ? 
Or do you have a picture of Muriel's aunt hiding under the pillow ? "" You ... " A bright orange streak fluttered beneath Harry's left hand and flipped over Ginny a few inches : Harry pushed Ron into the wall , " do not be crazy ... "" Harry was dating Cho Chang ! " And Hermione was in the arms of Viktor Krum , only he considered it a disgusting thing , Ron , and that was because he had only one experience . 12 year old child ! " And then , she ran away . 
Harry quickly released Ron ; His face looked horrified . 
They stood there , panting , until Mrs. Norris , Rich's cat , appeared at the corner , breaking the tension . " Let's go , " said Harry , as the footsteps of Filch were slamming into his ears . 
They rushed up the stairs and through the seventh corridor . " Oh , let's get out of here ! " Ron barked at a little girl , causing him to scare and drop the egg toad . 
Harry could not pay attention to the sound of broken glass ; it feels disoriented , dizzy ; The lightning just came to this . 
Just because it's Ron's sister , he told himself . 
I just do not like seeing him kiss Dean because it's Ron's brother ... 
But it was impossible to resist in his mind a seemingly empty corridor like that , with it kissing Ginny ... 
The demon in his chest moaned ... but then he saw Ron waving the embroidered curtain and pointed his wand at Harry , screaming something like " traitor " ... " should be friends " " Do you think Hermione was kissing Krum ? " Ron asked , as they reached Mrs. Beo . 
Harry had started to think badly and had to pull his thoughts from a corridor without Ron's intrusion , only with him and Ginny together ... " What ? " say embarrassed 
" Yeah ... uh ... " The honest answer must be " yes , " but he does not want to say it . 
Anyway , Ron seems to be expecting the worst of Harry's face . " Dilligrout , " he gasped , and they went through the hole in the picture to enter the common room . 
No one remembers Ginny or Hermione any more ; Instead , they did not talk to each other that night and climbed into bed in silence , both of them in separate thoughts , Harry long for a long time , looking at the top of the bed in the bed and Trying to tell myself that his feelings for Ginny are just his sister's brother . 
They've lived , are not they , like brothers and sisters during the summer , playing Quidditch , teasing Ron , laughing at each other about Bill and Phlegm . 
He's used to Ginny a long time ago ... 
It was very natural when he felt he needed to protect her ... very naturally when he wanted to take care of her ... wanted to break Dean's hand for kissing her ... 
No ... it will have to control the emotion of that sister brother ... 
Ron snored loudly . 
Ron's younger sister , Harry told himself . 
Ron's baby . 
It is out of control . 
She could not trade her friendship with Ron for anything else . 
He banged his pillow more comfortably and waited for sleep to come , trying his best not to let her thoughts float around Ginny . 
Harry wakes up the next morning , a little dazed and confused for a series of dreams in which Ron chases him with the club , but at noon he wants to change Ron to actually get Ron in the dream . , since it was not only cold with Ginny and Dean , but also a severely wounded and confused Hermione , exactly the same , cruelly and arbitrarily . 
What's up , Ron had seemed to be , all night long , easily annoyed and beaten like a monster chasing a tentative size . 
Harry had spent the day trying to keep Ron and Hermione safe , but did not succeed ; Finally , Hermione was in her bed in the most anger , and Ron went underground into the bedroom after cursing the worst of the crooks who cringed because they were watching . 
With the loss of Harry's morale , Ron's new condition did not change in the next few days . 
Even worse , it adds a more pathetic slump in its ability to keep golf , making it even more aggressive , and then at the last Quidditch rehearsal before Saturday's game , it slipping all the strikes that Truy Cửn made toward her , but scolded everyone so much that it made Demelza Robins cry . " You go and leave it alone ! " Peakes yelled , it was only two - thirds taller than Ron , but he was holding a heavy pestle . " HANG ! " Harry screamed , as he saw Ginny glaring at Ron and , still remembering her reputation for having accomplished the Sting - Ba - Be , roared to intervene . before everything else is within management . " Peakes , you go take the bludgers off , do not you agree , today you're good Ron ... " he waited until the other members went far enough to say , " you are My best friend , but you keep treating other people like me to get you out of the team . " He really thought at the time that Ron was able to hit him , but that was a bad thing . Worse happened : Ron dangled by his broom . 
All the wills have disappeared and it says , " Please withdraw . 
I'm too bad . " You are not bad and you can not withdraw ! " Harry said fiercely , pulling Ron back in his cloak . " You can keep your golfer very good if you're mentally prepared , it's just a psychological problem you're in ! " You said I had a mental problem ? " Oh , maybe I said that ! " They looked at each other for a moment , then Ron shook his head tiredly . " I know you do not have time to find a new captain , so I ' ll play tomorrow , but if we lose , that sure is So what , I will leave the team . " There's nothing Harry can do to change the situation . 
He tried to make Ron more confident during dinner , but Ron was too busy with irritation and grumbling with Hermione to take care of what he said . 
Harry resumed in the common room later , but the assertion that Ron's leaving the team could cause the team to disintegrate somewhat disturbed by the fact that the rest of the squad was grappling in . A far corner , apparently talking about Ron and throwing it at cruelty . 
Finally Harry had to make himself angry once more , the hope of provoking Ron's self - esteem , and possibly his ability to keep the golf course , but this way seems unsuccessful . encouraging words ; Ron went to sleep in a depressing and hopeless mood than ever before . 
Harry was long gone in the dark . 
He does not want to lose in the upcoming match ; It's not because this is the first time he's been a captain , but because he's determined to beat Draco Malfoy in Quidditch even if he can not prove his doubts about Draco . 
But if Ron keeps playing like he did in recent times , hopefully winning is very slim . 
If there is something it can do to make Ron more harmonious ... make it play with the best possible ... what can be sure Ron has a great day ... 
And the answer came to Harry in a great inspiration , all of a sudden . 
Breakfast is a very easy thing to cause disturbance like the previous times ; The Slytherins took a breath and mocked a great Gryffindor in the Great Hall . 
Harry looked at the ceiling and saw a blue sky , cloudy : a good omen . 
Gryffindor's table , a red and yellow mass , welcomed when Harry and Ron arrived . 
Harry laughed and waved ; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head . " Come on , Ron ! " Lavender called . " I know you play great ! " : Ron ignored her . " Tea ? " Harry asked him . " The coffee ? 
Pumpkin juice ? "" Whatever , " said Ron , mournful , biting into a slice of bread . 
A few minutes later , Hermione , still very tired of Ron's recent discomforts , did not go down to breakfast with her two children , stopping on the way to the table . " How are you guys ? " Asked the girl , eyes closed behind Ron's neck . " Very good , " said Harry , concentrating giving Ron a glass of pumpkin juice . " This is Ron . 
Drink it all . " Ron just brought the glass to Hermione's lips and said , " Do not drink that Ron ! " " Harry and Ron both looked up at her . " Why not ? " Said Ron . 
Hermione was staring at Harry like she could not believe her eyes . " You just put something in the water . " " What ? " Said Harry . " You hear what ? 
I've seen it . 
He just poured something into Ron's glass . 
You have a bottle in your hand ! "" I do not know what you're talking about , " said Harry , tucking the small bottle in his pocket . " Ron , I warn you , do not drink ! " Said Hermione again , scared , but Ron picked up the glass , drank it in a mouthful , and said , " Do not order me 
Hermione . " She feels offended . 
Bending down so low that only Harry could hear , she hissed , " You must be fired for that action . 
I can not believe you did that , Harry ! "" See who's talking , " he whispered . " Not recently cursing anyone ? " She ran straight out of the two . 
Harry watched her run away without regret . 
Hermione never understood how important Quidditch was . 
Then he looked at Ron , who was licking his lips . " It's almost time ... " Harry ignored him . 
The cold grass was scratching at the foot as the youngsters came to the stadium . " Good weather , is not it ? " Asked Ron . " Yeah , " said Ron , who was now gray and looking sick . 
Ginny and Demelza wore Quidditch and waited in the waiting room . " Great condition ! " Ginny said , ignoring Ron . " And guess what ? 
Slytherin's Vaisey was beaten by a Bludger in the training session yesterday so he could not play because he was so hurt ! 
And even more amazing ... 
Malfoy is sick ! " " What ? " Said Harry , running around to look at her . " It's sick ? 
What's wrong ? "" I do not know , but it's great for my team , " Ginny said brightly . " They took Harper instead ; It's your age and it's extremely stupid . " Harry laughed absentmindedly , but when he was wearing a bright red robe , he never thought of Quidditch . 
Malfoy once said he could not play because of injuries , but that time it was certain the match would be left to the best time for the Slytherin . 
Why is it now being replaced ? 
Is it extremely sick , or is it just pretending ? " That's suspicious , is not it ? " he whispered to Ron . " Malfoy did not play ? " " I think that was lucky , " said Ron , seeming to be more alive . 
" And Vaisey is always out , he's the best scorer , I do not like him ... hey ! " He said at once , pausing halfway to pulling his trousers into place and staring at Harry . " What ? " " I ... you ... " Ron lowered his voice , afraid and excited . " My water ... my pumpkin juice ... are not you ... ? " Harry raised his eyebrows , saying nothing , " We ' ll start in about five minutes , you should wear shoes . Let's go . " The boys stepped out in screams . 
One stadium is yellow and red , the other green and silver . 
Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws also split : in the midst of screams and applause Harry could clearly distinguish the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion hat . 
Harry walked over to Mrs. Hooch , the referee , standing ready to drop the balls out of the box . " The captain shook hands , " she said , and Harry was squeezed by the new Slytherin captain , Urquhart . " Up the broom . 
Listen to the horn ... 
father ... 
two ... 
" The whistle blared , Harry and the others tread on the frozen ground , and they flew up . 
Harry screamed around the property , searching for the Snitch , and paying attention to Harper , who was now staring at the distance behind him . 
Then a voice was rumbling differently from the voice of the normal narrator . " Look , they are , and I think we are all very surprised with the team that Potter set up this year . 
A lot of comments , with Ronald Weasley flickering in the name of goalkeeper last year , suggest that he could be kicked out of the team , but of course , a little personal friendship with the team helped . ... " 
The last words were greeted with sarcasm and applause from the Slytherins at the other end . 
Harry threw his neck around his broom to find the podium . 
A tall , thin blond with a raised upright nose , talking to the magical speaker that had been used by Lee Jordan ; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith , a Hufflepuff player whom he hated . " Oh , and this is Slytherin's first chance , it's Urquhart's going down and ... " Harry's stomach twisted . 
" ... Weasley got caught , he's lucky sometimes , I suppose ... " " Yeah , that's true , " Harry whispered , laughing at himself . Grabbing down to keep the eye to find the traces of the Snitch is hiding . 
Half an hour passed , Gryffindor was leading 60 - 0 , Ron had some spectacular save , a few with gloves , and Ginny scored four of Gryffindor's six goals . This made Zacharias hesitant to admit that the Weasley boys were in the team just because Harry liked it , and now turned to Peakes and Coote . " Of course , Coote was not born as a Torpedo , " Zacharias said hoarsely , " they seem to have more muscles ... " " bang a bludger on it ! " Harry called Coote as he dashed . Come on , but Coote , instead , is laughing so hard , chose to smash the next bludger into Harper , who had recently jumped to Harry in the opposite direction . 
Harry was pleased to hear the murmur , which meant that the Bludger had found his true destination . 
Seems like Gryffindor did not make a small mistake . 
They keep on scoring , again and again , and at the other end of the pitch , Ron is protecting the ring with obvious ease . 
It was really laughing , and as the crowd greeted a breathtaking chorus with the excitement of a favorite old song , " Weasley is our King , " he had orchestrated the orchestra from above . high . " Does he think it's something special today , " a chirping voice said , and Harry nearly fell from his broom as Harper bumped into it very forcefully and deliberately . " Your betrayed friend ... " Hooch was about to turn away , and although Gryffindor's house was screaming indignantly , when she returned to Harper's disappearance . 
With pain , Harry pursued it , with the intention of pounding on it one after another ... " And I think Slytherin's Harper saw the Snitch ! " Zacharias Smith said through the loudspeaker . " Yes , he was sure to see something that Potter did not ! " Smith was an idiot , Harry thought , did not he see that they bumped into each other ? 
But moments later , the stomach almost fell off the air . 
Smith was right and Harry was wrong : Harper did not go off randomly ; He saw what Harry did not see : the Snitch hovered above them , glittering in the blue sky . 
Harry's speeding ; The wind was screaming in his ear so loud that he could not hear Smith's comments or the crowd , but Harper was still in the front , and Gryffindor had only 100 points ; If Harper had the ball before then Gryffindor would lose ... and now Harper is only a few feet away , his arms widening . " Oh my Harper ! " Harry screamed in despair . " How much Malfoy paid you to replace it ? " He did not know who had made him say that , but Harper pretended to be surprised ; He shook his hand off the Snitch , letting it get out of his fingers , and leapt out of it . 
Harry made a powerful blow to the small ball , and then grabbed it . " HERE ! " screamed Harry . 
Fly around , it dives to the ground and the Snitch is held high in the hand . 
As the crowd realized what was going on , a loud cheering sound almost drowned out the whistle . " Ginny , where are you going ? " Screamed Harry , who was being squeezed in 
hiding in the air from the rest of the team , but Ginny continues to accelerate through them , until , with an extremely powerful blow , she hits the station . 
With the crowd screaming and laughing , Gryffindor landed next to the wood chips that Zacharias was trembling with ; Harry heard Ginny say inadvertently to Professor McGonagall in anger , " Forgive me , Professor , I'm sorry . " Laughing , Harry left the rest of the team and hugged Ginny , but he dropped it . out very fast . 
Despite her look , she clapped for Ron in the back as all the hostility disappeared . Gryffindor left the field in hand , punched the air and waved his supporters . 
The atmosphere in the dressing room was so bustling . " Dinner in the common room , Seamus said ! " Dean shouted cheerfully . " Come on , Ginny , Demelza ! " Ron and Harry were the last two in the locker room . 
They're getting ready , Hermione comes in . 
She was squeezing Gryffindor's scarf in her hands and looked angry and determined . " I want to talk to you Harry . " She took a deep breath . " You should not do that . 
You heard Slughorn , it's forbidden . " What are you trying to do , accuse us ? " Asked Ron . " What are you two talking about ? " Harry asked , turning to hang up his cloak , so that they could not see it laughing , " You know what we're talking about ! " Hermione said irritably . " He mixed Ron's juice with the lucky drug at breakfast ! 
Felix Felicis ! "" Where , I do not , " said Harry , turning to look at them . " There you were , Harry , and so everything went well , there was a missing Slytherin player and Ron caught all . the blow ! " I do not give in ! " Said Harry , laughing more . 
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small vial Hermione had seen this morning . 
It was filled with yellow gold and the lid was still closed by the glue . " I want Ron to think that I did , so I pretended I knew you were watching . " He looked at Ron . " You saved because you felt lucky . 
You do it all yourself . " He put the bottle back in his pocket . " Really , there's nothing in my pumpkin juice ? " Ron was shocked . " But the weather was good ... and Vaisey could not play ... 
I do not drink lucky drugs ? " Harry shook his head . 
Ron looked at it for a moment , then turned to Hermione , faking her voice . " He put Felix Felicis in Ron's water this morning , so he saved all the goals ! 
See you ! 
I do not need anything to help Hermione ! "" I never said you could not ... Ron , you also thought you were taking medicine ! " But Ron threw her out the door with the broom on her shoulder . " Oh , " said Harry in silence , he could not doubt that the plan was going this way , " then ... let's go to the party ? " You go ! " Hermione said , winking to stop crying . " I'm getting fed up with Ron , I do not know what to do anymore ... " And she jumped out of the dressing room . 
Harry walked slowly down the courtyard to the castle , across a crowd , many of whom were congratulating him , but he was disappointed ; It was certain that if Ron won the match , he and Hermione would be able to get on with each other immediately . 
He does not know how it could explain to Hermione that the reason she made Ron annoyed was the kissing of Viktor Krum , also because it happened so long ago . 
Harry could not find Hermione at Gryffindor's party , when it came to being the hottest . 
The greetings and applause welcomed the presence of it , and it was soon surrounded by a bunch of people wanting to congratulate . 
Want to get rid of 
The Creevey brothers , who were trying to play the battle from one shot to the next , and a whole bunch of girls around it , laughed at the smallest comment and blinked , right . It took him a while to find Ron . 
It was finally liberated from Romilda Vane , trying to suggest that she could go to Slughorn's party with him . 
As he was huddling toward the table , he went straight to Ginny , with Arnold the Dwarf on his shoulders , and the crookshanks glistening with hopeful meow . " Find Ron , my lord ? " The little girl laughed . " He's there , a dirty hypocrite . " Harry looked toward the corner of her house . There , with the view of the room , Ron was standing , hugging Lavender Brown so hard to say who his hand was . " It's like he's gnawing at her face , is not she ? " Ginny said calmly . " But I think he has to change the method . 
Good match , Harry . " She patted his hand , and Harry felt his stomach drop , but then she went out for more butter . 
Crookshanks lined her up , her golden eyes staring at Arnold . 
Harry turned away from Ron , at this point he did not want to see it , as soon as the portrait hole closed . 
With a lack of emotion , he felt a curly brown curl flick through . 
It rushes forward , hits Romilda Vane again , and pulls the picture of Mrs. Beo . 
The outer corridor looked very deserted . " Hermione ? " She found her in the first locker room she was in . 
She was sitting on the teacher's chair , alone , except for a ring of golden sparrows hovering over her head , apparently she had just turned from the air . 
Harry could not admire her spell abilities at this time . " Hello , Harry , " she said in a trembling voice . " I'm practicing . " " Yeah ... that ... 
Oh ... that's good ... " said Harry . 
He did not know what to say to her . 
She just wished there was a fragile chance she did not see Ron , that she merely left the room because of the noisy party , as she said , with an unnatural voice , " Ron seems to like it . The party . "" Oh ... so ? " said Harry . " Do not pretend you do not see it , " said Hermione . " Did he hide that ? " The door behind them opened . 
In Harry's fears , Ron walks in , grinning , pulling Lavender with his hand . " Oh , " he said , turning up immediately as he saw Harry and Hermione . " Oh ! " Lavender said , and the little girl ran out of the room , giggling . 
The door closed behind her . 
There was a tremendous silence , rising and exploding . 
Hermione was staring at Ron , who was avoiding her face at the moment , but said with a strange mixture of self - confidence and confusion , " Hi Harry ! 
I know where you go ! " Hermione slipped from the table . 
The golden sparrows continue to creep over her head making her look like a strange solar system made of furs . " You should not let Lavender wait outside , " she said softly . " She will not know where you are going to go . " She walked slowly and steadily toward the door . 
Harry glanced at Ron , still reassured at the fact that nothing was worse than that . " Oppugno ! " Came a cry from the door . 
Harry whirled around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron , whose expression was wild : The little birds were flashing like a yellow rain to Ron , who was crying and covering the ground . Her hands , but the birds still attack , dissection , rake any skin what they encounter . " Gerremoffme ! " He yelled , but with the last look full of hatred , Hermione thumped the door and disappeared . 
Harry could hear a sob before the door slammed shut . 
Chapter 15 The eternal curse 
Snow swirled outside the frozen windows . 
Christmas is coming very fast . 
Hagrid had one hand brought into the hallway 12 Christmas trees as usual . 
The wreaths of flowers and ropes revolve around the stair railings . 
Candles - no - shine - shines from the iron helmets of the armor and the large beam of mistletoe hanging between the corridors . 
A group of girls clutching their holly flowers collapses the hallway as Harry walks by . 
However , fortunately , Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings have given him an extraordinary knowledge of the crossroads of the castle , so it can be difficult to find the way through . flower flies to go to class . 
Ron , seeing such a compulsion as a walk is more jealous than hilarious , simply laughs at all that . 
Although Harry liked Ron more than the kind of sadness and sadness Ron had experienced in recent weeks , Ron's improvement was quite expensive . First , Harry suffered from the frequent presence of Lavender Brown , who looked like every moment of no kissing Ron was a dull moment . 
After all , Harry felt , once more , two of his closest friends seemed to never want to talk to each other . 
Ron , his arms and forearms still scratched by the attack from Hermione's birds , defended himself with a voice of resentment . " She can not complain , " she said to Harry . Guessing with Krum must also see someone want to pair with her . 
Oh , free . 
I do not do anything wrong . 
Harry did not answer , focusing on the book they had to read before the next Enlightenment lesson this morning ( Essence : A Quest ) . 
Steady with both Ron and Hermione , it spent most of the time quietly . 
" I never promised Hermione , " Ron muttered . " I mean , well , I was going to Slughorn's Christmas party with her , but she never said ... just like a person . friend ... 
I'm totally free ... 
Harry flipped through a page of Essence , knowing Ron was looking at it . 
Ron's voice grew into whispers that barely heard the flicker of the fire , though Harry thought it caught Krum's voice and could not complain again . 
Hermione's schedule was so dense that Harry could not talk to her in the evenings , when Ron , in any matter , wrapped himself around Lavender until he did not notice what Harry was doing . 
Hermione did not sit in the common room when Ron was there , so Harry often met her in the library , which meant they always had to talk whispers . 
" He's absolutely free to kiss anyone he likes , " said Hermione , while Mrs. Pince , the librarian , lurked at the shelves behind them . " I really do not care . 
She picked up a feather and brushed it up so badly that she stabbed a hole in the parchment . 
Harry did not say anything . 
He felt his voice disappear as soon as he spoke . 
It bends a little lower on the advanced poison preparation and continues to hit the notes in the Everlasting Elixirs , occasionally pausing to decipher the useful additions of the Prince to the post . Libatius Borage's . 
" And by the way , " said Hermione , after a moment - he had to be careful . 
" I said the last time , " said Harry , his voice whispering a little husky after 45 minutes of silence . " I did not return to this book , I learned more from Prince Tu Lai than Snape and Slughorn . Teach yourself in - "" I'm not talking about your so - called dummy prince , " said Hermione , looking at the book with her irritation as if she was rude to her . " I talked to you earlier . 
He entered the female bathroom before coming here and there were dozens of girls , including Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to cheat him a little love . 
All hope that they will be with you to the party of Slughorn and it seems they have bought the love of Fred and George , which I can sure is effective ... 
- Why do not you confiscate ? 
Harry asked . 
Hermione's abandonment of the penchant for discipline in this case seems strange . 
Said Hermione contemptuously : - They did not bring the bath to the bathroom . 
They only plot . 
I wondered , even the Prince of Hyla - she looked at the book resentfully - did not dream of an antidote for a dozen different drugs together at once . 
I would invite someone to a party with you , so stop the others thinking they still have a chance . 
Tomorrow night , they are becoming desperate . 
" There's no one I want to invite , " Harry murmured , still trying his best not to think of Ginny , despite the fact that she was still present in her dream in ways that made her grateful to Ron . Can not do Legilimency ? - Well , be careful what you drink , because Romilda Vane seems to have serious intentions . 
She pulled out her long parchment paper and wrote her arithmetic essay and continued to scrape it with a pen . 
Harry looked at the girl where the idea was . 
" Wait , " he said slowly . " I think Filch is forbidden to buy anything from the Weasley Wings Shop . 
- And who cares what Filch prohibits ? 
Said Hermione , concentrating on her essay . 
- But I think all the owls were searched ? 
Then how can girls bring love into school ? 
" Fred and George sent them in the form of perfumes or coughs , " said Hermione . That is part of the Photo Order Service of the photos . 
- You know so much about it ! 
Hermione looked at her with irritation as she looked at her Advanced Poisoning : " All there was in the back of the bottle for me and Ginny for the summer , " she said coldly . Run around to give poison to people's drinks ... or pretend to do , either way is bad . 
" Okay , do not think about it , " Harry said quickly . " The point is , Filch is stupid , is not he ? 
The girls get the school stuff by camouflage into something else ! Then why Malfoy can not bring the necklace to school ... ? 
" Oh , Harry , do not talk about it ! 
- Come on , why ? 
Harry demanded . 
- See , the Secret Sensor recognizes creeps , curses and secret spells , does not it ? 
They are used to find magic and dark objects . 
They can detect strong curses like the ring in seconds . 
But things just put in the broken bottle do not pay attention - and anyway , love is not dark or dangerous ... 
" You said it easy , " Harry murmured , thinking of Romilda Vane . 
" ... so do not expect Filch to realize that they are not cough drugs , and he's not a good witch , so I guess you can say poison from ... 
Hermione stopped abruptly . 
Harry also hears , somebody moves in the dark shelves behind them . 
They spit and a little later , like Mrs. Pince's vines , around the corner , her deep cheeks , her paper - like skin and her cranky nose illuminated by the lamp she had brought . - The game returns in the correct place all the things borrowed . 
What to do with that book , that spoiled name ? 
- This one of you , not the library ! 
Harry hurriedly said , pulling his Enhanced Medication from the table as Mrs. Pince came in with a clawed hand . 
- steal ! 
She hissed . 
Disheartened 
- this is just a written book ! 
Said Harry , snatching the book away from her . 
She seemed to confiscate the book . 
Hermione quickly arranges the supplies , grabs Harry and pulls it away . 
- She will ban you from the library if you are not careful . 
Why do you have to carry that stupid book ? 
- It was not my fault she was screaming like that , Hermione . 
Why do not you think she can overhear his filthy rhetoric about Filch ? 
I always think something between the two of you ... 
- Ồ ! 
Ha .. ha ... 
Enthralled by the fact that they can talk as usual , they follow a desolate hallway , lights back to the common room , discusses whether or not a secret affair between Filch and her grandmother Pince . 
- flashy Harry told Mrs. Beo , that is the new code on holidays . 
- You too ! 
Mrs. Beo said with a mischievous smile , and threw herself over to them . 
- Hi , Harry ! 
Vamilda Vane says as soon as it climbs through the portrait hole - Drinking a lilac juice ? 
Hermione throws it a look See - me - say - yet ? over her shoulder . 
" No , thanks , " Harry said quickly . " I do not like it . 
" Oh , then get this one , " said Romilda , throwing a box in his hand . " Chocolate , Fireberry Whiskey . 
My grandma sent me , but I did not like it . 
- Oh , yes , thanks - Harry did not know how to say - Eh , I just passed by this ... 
It rushed behind Hermione , her voice softening . 
" Tell me , " said Hermione briefly , " the sooner you invite someone , the sooner you ' ll be able to rest and you can ... " 
But her face was suddenly empty . 
She saw Ron and Lavender hugging each other in the armchair . 
" Oh , good night , Harry , " said Hermione , even though it was only seven o ' clock in the evening , and she went to her bedroom and did not say a word . 
Harry went to bed , comforting himself that there was only one more school day to pass , including Slughorn's party , and then Ron and Ron could together leave for the Burrow . 
Apparently Ron and Hermione could not make it before the holidays 
First , but perhaps , well , the holiday will help both calm down , think more about how to handle his . 
But hope is not much , and they are still bad throughout the transformation lesson the next day . 
They embark on a difficult - to - practice lesson , practicing in front of the mirror , trying to change the color of their own eyebrows . 
Hermione laughed at how unkindly Ron's mischievous effort was , while he did not know how to handle his strange whisker . 
Ron retaliates by imprisoning Hermione on the chair , when Professor McGonagall poses a question , making Lavender and Parvati extremely funny , and makes Hermione almost cry again . 
She rushed out of the classroom as the bell rang , leaving her piles behind . 
Harry , decides that at this moment Hermione needs it more than Ron , oblivious of what she left behind and run after . 
It finally catches her when she appears from the female bathroom . 
She accompanied Luna Lovegood , who was panting behind Hermione's back . 
" Oh , hello , " Luna said , " do you know that one of his brows is dazzling yellow ? 
- Hello Luna . 
Hermione , you left the map ... 
She gave her books . 
" Oh , yes , " said Hermione , choking , holding up her books , and quickly turned away to hide the fact that she wiped away tears . " Thanks , Harry . 
Well , I went over ... 
And she hurried away , not giving Harry some time to say something comforting , though admittedly it could not think of anything . 
Luna said : - She is a bit miserable . At first I thought Myrtle - crying - in here , but it turned out to be Hermione . 
She said something about Ron Weasley . 
" Oh , they were arguing , " said Harry , as they walked down the corridor together . " He's funny sometimes , is not he ? " 
But he was a bit cruel . 
I noticed that last year . 
" I think so , " said Harry . 
Luna expresses her usual habit of talking about unpleasant things . 
He has never met anyone like this girl - Was your semester good then ? 
" Alright , " Luna said . " I'm a little lonely without the DA team . 
Anyway , Ginny is very good . 
Previously , she prevented two boys in the Transfiguration class calling me Khung ... 
- Would you like to come with me to Slughorn's party tonight ? 
Words rush out of Harry's mouth before it can stop . 
He listens to himself as if someone else was talking . 
Luna looked at him with amazement . " Slughorn's party ? " 
With him ? 
" Oh , " said Harry , " we have the right to invite you , and I think you may like it ... I mean ... 
- He tried to make his intentions clear - I mean ... just like a friend , you know . 
But if you do not like it ... 
He almost hoped she would not want to go . 
- Oh no , I would love to go with you as a friend ! 
Luna smiled , she had never seen her so radiant before . No one ever invited me to a party like a friend . 
So you stained your eyebrows , for the party ? 
Do you have to do that ? 
" No , " Harry said firmly , " this is just a negligence , I ' ll ask Hermione to fix it for you . " 
Well , I ' ll meet you in the Great Hall at 8 o ' clock . 
- A ha ... a scream and they both jumped up . 
No one noticed that they were just passing underneath the Peeves , this ghost was hanging upside down on the lampshade and looking at them , laughing at each other . 
- Potty invited Loony to party ! 
Potty and Loony ! 
Potty iuuuu Looooon ! 
And it shot off , loudly yelled Potty love Loony Harry said : - Please keep it private ! 
- And it sure , the whole school will soon know Harry Potter invited Luna Lovegood to the party Slughorn . 
- You can invite anyone ! 
Said Ron at dinner with no accent - Anyone - 
And you choose Lovegood Khung ? 
- Do not call her like that , Ron - Ginny nodded , stopping behind Harry as he was entering with his friends . - I'm glad you invited him , Harry . 
She is very active . 
And she went down to sit with Dean . 
Harry tried to be pleased that Ginny was happy when he invited Luna to the party , but it was impossible . At a distant corner table , Hermione sat alone eating casseroles . 
Harry saw Ron peek at her . 
" You can apologize , " Harry offered straight . 
- What ? to receive another attack by the canaries ? 
Ron grumbled . 
- What did you do to parody her ? 
- She laughed her mustache ! 
- Me too . 
I've never seen anything so stupid . 
But Ron did not seem to hear anything . 
Lavender arrives with Parvati . 
Squeezing between Harry and Ron , Lavender wrapped her arms around Ron's neck . 
" Good morning , Harry , " said Parvati , seeming to be as embarrassed and troubled as Harry by the other two's behavior . 
- Hello ! 
How are you ? 
Do you still stay at Hogwarts ? 
I heard your parents want you home . 
" I managed to say , Mom , do not worry now , " said Parvati . " That Katie was really a joke , and since then nothing happened . 
Oh , hello Hermione ! 
Parvati smiled happily . 
Harry could have said she felt guilty for laughing at Hermione during her transformation . 
He looked around and saw Hermione smile back , looking even brighter . Sometimes girls are weird . 
" Hi Parvati , " said Hermione , completely ignoring Ron and Lavender . " Are you going to the Slughorn party tonight ? " 
" I was not invited , " Parvati said sadly , " although I like to go . 
It sounds great . 
Will you go , right ? 
- Oh , I made an appointment for Cormac at 8 o ' clock and we will ... 
A sound like a pipe pulled out of the water and Ron appeared . 
Hermione did not seem to hear anything . 
- ... we will go to the party . 
- Cormac ? 
" You mean Cormac McLaggen ? " Said Parvati . 
" That's right , " said Hermione sweetly . " The one who's almost - she especially emphasizes the word - will become the Gryffindor goalkeeper . 
" And then you go out with him , " said Parvati , eyes wide open . " Oh , you know ? 
Hermione replied , with a giggle - Hermione . 
- Are not ! 
Parvati says , looking extremely excited by this gossiping story - well , you seem to like the Quidditch players . The first is Krum , now McLaggen ... 
" I like the Quiddtch players really well , " Hermione corrected , still smiling . " Well , hello , I have to go and prepare for this party ... " 
She's gone . 
Immediately , Lavender and Parvati discussed the new subject , with all they had heard about McLaggen and had predicted Hermione . 
Ron looked dumb and did not say anything . 
Harry left , thinking about the retaliation of the girls . 
When it came to the Hall at 8 pm , he saw an unusual crowd of girls hiding there , all staring as it reached Luna . 
The girl in a silver - plated floral dress was the target of a giggle from the audience , but she looked pretty . 
Anyway , Harry was glad she had put the turnips , butterfly necklaces and her glasses on . 
- hello - it says - we go ? 
" Yes , " she said , full of happiness . " Where is the party ? " 
" Slughorn's office , " Harry replied , leading her away on the marble stairs , away from the gaze and whisper . " Did you hear about the vampires coming ? 
- Rufus Scrimgeour ? 
- You ... what ? 
Harry - I mean Minister of Magic ? 
" Yes , he's a vampire , " Luna said seriously . " Daddy wrote a long story about it when Scrimgeour won Cornelious Fudge , but was banned from publishing by someone in the Department . Of course they do not want the truth to burst . 
Harry did not answer , he thought it was hard for Rufus Scrimgeour to be a vampire , but Luna often repeats his father's strange views as if they were real . 
They came to Slughorn's room and the laughter , the music , the conversation grew in their steps . 
Either the room was built like that , or Slughorn used some magic , his office larger than the normal room of the teacher . 
Ceilings and walls are hung with emerald curtains , rich reds and golds that make them feel like they are in an immense tent . 
The room was crowded , stuffy and filled with red light from a splendid golden lamp in the middle of the ceiling , with the real fairies fluttering and shining brightly . 
The chorus sounds like mandolin from a distant corner . 
The smoke from the pipe of the elders of the sorcerers emanates like a fog , and the elves find their way through the forest of limbs with shrieked voices , obscured by heavy silver bowls . The food they carry , makes them look like mobile tables . 
- Harry , my baby boy ! 
Slughorn said loudly , almost as Harry and Luna were just poking through the door - here , in here , there were many people wanting to meet you ! 
Mr. Slughorn was wearing a tassel hat that matched his smoke suit . 
Grabbing Harry's hand as if to defoliate with it , Slughorn decided to take it to the table . 
Harry holds Luna's hand and pulls her along . 
" Harry , I want you to meet Eldred Worple , my former student , the Blood Brothers : my life between Vampires - and , of course , his Sanguini . 
Worple , a small man with glasses , groaned for Harry's hand and shook with enthusiasm . 
Vampire Sanguini , tall and haggard with dark circles , only nods . 
He looked depressed . 
A group of girls standing near him , curious curiosity . 
Worple said , looking at Harry's face with his shortsighted eyes . " Harry , just the other day you told Slughorn , what's the Harry Potter biography that we all expected ? " 
- Er ... so ... ? 
- It is as humble as Slughorn describes it ! 
The appearance of Worple changed , suddenly - work : - But seriously , he is very happy to write himself , the public yearning to know more about me , brother , thirst ! 
If you prepare me some interviews , talk in four or five hours , how can we finish the book within a few months ? 
I just have to give up a little , I guarantee you . 
Ask Sanguini if ​​ this is correct ... 
Sanguini , stay here ! 
Worple added , suddenly becoming so strict with the vampire who was about to follow a group of girls , the hungry expression appeared in his eyes . 
- Hey , eat grilled chicken ! 
Worple took a piece of parchment from an elf passing by and pressed Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Harry : " My dear brother , you can make a lot of gold , I can not imagine it . .. 
" I do not like it , and I'm sorry , I saw a friend . " 
He pulled Luna back into the crowd . 
It really just saw a long brown hair disappearing between something that looks like two members of the gangster music - Hermione ! 
Hermione ! 
- Harry ! 
You're here , thank you ! 
Hello Luna ! 
- What happened to you ? 
Harry asked Hermione , who looked like she had just emerged from the bushes of the demon trap . 
" Well , I just got out of my mind ... I just left Cormac , " Hermione replied . " Under the dust , " she explained , as Harry continued to stare . 
He said sharply : - It is worth living , who show you go with him ! 
Hermione calmly : - I think he is the best Ron . 
I thought about Zacharias Smith , but I think , in terms of everything ... 
Harry disgusted : - You charge Smith ? 
- Oh , and I started to wish I had picked that guy . 
McLaggen makes Grawp look like a son . ( Compared to McLaggen , the giant Grawp is also polite . ) Let's go this way , we can see him go , he's tall ... 
The three of them walked to the other corner of the room , picking up a bunch of honey on the way , and realized it was too late Professor Trelawney was alone there . 
Luna politely : - Hello ! 
Professor Trelawney focused on Luna with difficulty . 
Harry could smell the scent of wine . 
She said : - Hi dear . 
I have not seen you in class lately ... 
- Yes , this year I studied with Firenze . 
Professor Trelawney responded with anger , giggles to say : - Oh , of course , Firenze - or Horse , as I like to think more about him . 
You see , now , when I was back in class , Professor Dumbledore would have to get rid of that horse ? 
But no ... we divide the class ... it's an insult , frankly , an insult . 
Do you know ... 
Professor Trelawney seems too drunk to recognize Harry . 
At the moment she is furiously criticizing Firenze , Harry pulls Hermione closer and says : - Be frank , do you intend to go with Ron that he had talked about the test goalkeeper ? 
Hermione raised her eyebrows : " Do you think I'm so humble ? 
Harry looked at her shrewdly : - Hermione , if you could invite McLaggen ... 
Hermione mature : - That is different . 
I was not going to tell Ron anything right or wrong that happened at that test . 
Harry boiled : - Good ! 
Because Ron will be isolated again , and we will lose the next battle ... 
Hermione angrily : - Quidditch ! 
Do all the boys just care about that ? 
Cormac did not ask me a question about myself , no , I was just treated by McLaggen's Great Hitchhiker's No - Stop , until ... Oh no , he came ! 
She was as fast as litter . 
A second ago she was here , the next time she was squatting between two wizards laughing and disappearing . 
A moment later , McLaggen crossed the crowd and asked , " Did you see Hermione ? " 
" No , sorry , " said Harry , and he turned to talk to Luna quickly , forgetting who she was talking to . 
- Harry Potter ! 
Professor Trelawney said , his voice trembling trembling , first attention to it . 
Harry said in a low voice , " Oh , hello ! 
" My son , " said the voice , with a profound voice . 
The rumors ! 
Stories ! 
Chosen one ! 
Of course , we have known for a long time ... 
The signs are never good , Harry ... but why do not you go back to the Prophet class ? 
With me , as with everyone , this subject is extremely important ! 
A loud voice said , " Well , Sybill , we all think our subject is the most important ! 
And Mr. Slughorn appeared next to Professor Trelawney , with a red face , a slightly devious hat , a glass of wine in one hand , and a great chunk of meat in one hand : - But I do not think I ever knew a natural talent . so in the poison ! 
Slughorn said , looking at Harry with reddening eyes - Ability - you know , like Mother ! 
I've only taught a few capable people like that , I can tell you that , Sybill , whatever , even Severus ... 
With Harry's horror , Slughorn waved his hands and it was as if drawing Snape from the air to them . 
Slughorn sobbed happily : - I was just talking about the possibility of Harry Potter's rare poisoning ! 
Surely you have to acknowledge it , of course , you taught it for five years ! 
Snape wrapped his arms around Snape's shoulders , Snape bent his nose down to look at Harry , eyes narrowed : - Really funny , I have never been impressed about all that when I taught Potter . 
Slughorn exclaimed : - Oh , really , an innate ability ! 
You must see what he did in his first lesson , the Draft of Living Death . 
Never had a student do so well the first time , I do not even think of you , Severus ... 
- Really ? 
Snape said quietly , his eyes still looking at Harry in disgust . 
It was a little nervous . 
It is most feared that Snape could investigate the cause of his newfound ability in the poison . 
Asked Slughorn , " Tell me what subjects do you enroll , Harry ? " 
- Prevention of Dark Arts , Turtles , Disappearances , Herbs ... 
Snape said with a sluggish , disdainful smile : " In short , all the subjects needed for a Spirit of Light . 
Harry stubbornly : 
Yes , that's all I want . 
" And you're going to be a great goddess , too , " said Slughorn . 
" I do not think you can become the Spirit of Harry , " Luna suddenly said . 
People look at her . 
- The Spirit is part of the Conspiracy of Boldness , I think everyone knows . 
They work there to make the Magician use a dark magic combination with periodontal disease . 
Harry choked half a glass of honey on his nose for laughing . 
Really , it's worth to invite Luna to this party ! 
Appearing from his glass , coughing , wet but still laughing , he finds something even more spirited : Draco Malfoy was brought to Argus Filch by his mentor . 
Mr. Filch wheezed , his chin trembling and his eyes glowed wildly . " Professor Slughorn , I caught this little boy in a hallway upstairs . 
He said he was invited to his party and was late . 
Have you invited him ? Malfoy from Filch , looking furious . 
She angrily : - Well , I was not invited . 
I just tried to sneak into the door , pleased ? 
- No ! 
Mr. Filch replied , a completely contradictory statement on the cheek of his face - " Trouble is over , man ! 
The principal said not to be outside at night unless allowed , right ? 
Slughorn waved his hand . " Okay , Argus , all right . 
It's Christmas day , and it's not a crime to be in a party . 
On this occasion , we forget about the punishment . 
You can stay , Draco . 
Filch's disappointment was quite predictable . 
But , Harry wondered , watching Malfoy , why did not he look so happy ? 
And why did Snape look at Malfoy as if he was just angry ... maybe ? ... 
just a little afraid ? 
But almost before Harry realized what he had seen , Filch shuffled away , muttering grimly . 
Malfoy put a smile on his face and thanked Slughorn for his tolerance . 
Snape's face became mysterious . 
Slughorn waved his hand as Malfoy thanked him : - It's okay ! 
I know the game grandfather , after all ... 
Malfoy said quickly : - You often judge very well that you are the best healer you ever knew ... 
Harry stared at Malfoy . 
Not flattery makes it amazing . 
He had seen Malfoy flatter Snape for a long time . 
But the fact is that Malfoy did it , after all , with the looks of wanting illness . This was the first time he had looked closer to Malfoy after a while , seeing dark circles under Malfoy's eyes and his skin tinged with a distinctly gray color . 
Snape said , " I want to talk to you , Draco . 
Slughorn hiccup again : - Come on Severus , Christmas , do not be so serious ... 
Snape replied curtly : " I am the President of the House , and I will decide whether to be strict or not . 
In my opinion , Draco . 
They left , Snape leading , Malfoy expression resentment resentment . 
Harry stopped for a moment , wondering , and then said , " Shut up , Luna ... " 
Oh ... the toilet ... 
Happy Girl : 
- Yes . 
And he thought she still heard her voice continue with the story of the Conspiracy of Boredom with Professor Trelawney - she seemed to care sincerely - as she rushed out of the crowd . 
It was easy to leave the party , pulled his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and covered him , for the corridor was completely deserted . 
But how hard it is to find Snape and Malfoy . 
Harry ran down the corridor , his footsteps were music and loud noises from Slughorn's room . 
Perhaps Snape took Malfoy down to the chapel ... and maybe he escorted him to the Slytherin common room , but Harry put his ear on each of the doors that he passed through the hallway until , With a strong agitation , he bent down to the last classroom lock in the hallway and heard the voices . 
- ... can not be faulted , Draco , if the game expelled ... 
- I do not do anything with it , okay ? 
- I hope to tell you the truth , because this is both awkward and stupid . 
She was suspected of dipping a hand into it . 
Malfoy angrily : - Who suspected me ? 
Last time , I did not do it , okay ? 
That Bell may have some enemies that no one knows . Do not look at me that way ! 
I know what I'm doing , I'm not stupid , but it does not work . 
I can stop you ! 
There was a pause , and then Snape said , quietly , " Well , so your Aunt Bellatrix taught Occlumency . " 
What are you trying to hide from your teacher , Draco ? 
- I do not try to hide my teacher , I just do not want him to interfere ! 
Harry pressed his ear closer to the keyhole ... What made Malfoy say to Snape , that Snape , whom he always admired , even loved ? 
- So you avoided us all this semester ? 
Fear of our intervention ? 
Have you ever noticed that someone has forgotten to go to my office when I repeat that I have to go there , Draco ... 
Malfoy scoffed : " Then ban me ! 
Denounce me with Dumbledore ! 
For a moment , silent . 
Then Snape said : - I completely know that I do not want to do any of these two things . 
- Well , then do not take me to your office . 
Mr. Snape said , his voice so low that Harry had to press his ear very hard into the keyhole to hear : - Listen . 
I'm trying to help you . 
I swore to my mother to protect her . 
I have made a Unbreakable Word , Draco ... 
- It seems you will have to break it , because I do not need your protection . This is my job , he gave me and me to do it . 
I plan and it will work , only longer than I thought a bit . 
- What's your plan ? 
- It's not your job ! 
- If you talk to me what you are trying to do , I can support you . 
- I have all the support I need , thanks ! 
I'm not alone ! 
- Tonight , the game is clear alone , and is extremely stupid when wandering in the corridor without anyone watching or wrapping . that is the primary error ... 
- I had Grabbe and Goyle come along if you did not ban them ! 
- Small voice ! 
Snape said , for Malfoy's voice was high . 
- If your Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass the Dhamma Masters for Dark Arts in this competition , they must be more diligent than ever . 
Malfoy interrupted : " What is the problem ? 
Anti Dark Arts - is not it all a joke , a duck ? 
As if any of us need protection against the Dark Arts ... 
Snape said , " It's a decisive trick to succeed , Draco ! " 
Where do you think I will be in all those years if I do not act like that ? Now listen ! 
You are scumbag , go around in the night , get yourself caught , and if the game put their trust in the supporters like Crabbe and Goyle ... 
- Not just them , I have other people on my side , better people ! 
- Why did not you tell me , and I can ... 
- I know what to do ! 
You want to rob me ! 
Another silence , and Snape said coldly : - Talking like a child . 
I fully understand that my father's arrest and his imprisonment caused pain , but ... 
Harry had enough alertness , he heard Malfoy footsteps on the other side of the door and just threw himself out of the open door . 
Malfoy strode down the corridor , across the open door of Slughorn's room , to a far corner and vanished from view . 
Hard to breathe , Harry continued to fall down as Snape slowly came from the classroom . 
Unforgettable face , he returned to the party . 
Harry stood on the floor , hiding under the cloak , thinking speedily ( his head racing ) . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 16 Gloomy Christmas 
" So Snape offered to help ? 
Was he really asking for help ? "" If you ask again , " said Harry , " I'm going to poke this mustard - "" I'm just asking for it ! " Said Ron . 
They were standing alone in the sink in the barn - kitchen stall , peeling the Weasley's Brussels sprouts , snow covered the window in front of them . " Oh , Snape asked for help ! " Said Harry . " He said he promised Malfoy's mother to protect him , that he had promised by the Unbreakable Word or something - " " The Permanent Word ? " Said Ron , looking startled . " No , he can not ... 
Are you sure ? "" Oh , I'm sure , " said Harry . " Why , what does it mean ? "" Well you can not break a Permanent Prologue ... "" I'm asking for myself , oddly enough . 
What happens if it breaks ? "" You will die , " said Ron plainly . " Fred and George tried to force me to swear it when I was five . 
I almost swore , I held Fred's hand and everything when Dad found us . 
Dad's almost out of his mind , " said Ron with flashy eyes . " It was the only time I saw my father as angry as his mother , Fred said his left buttock would never again . " Ahh . Through Fred's left buttock - "" What's up ? " Fred said as the twins walked into the kitchen . " Aaah , George , look . 
They use knives and everything . 
Oh my god ! " 
" I'm going to be seventeen in two more months , " said Ron harshly , " and then I could do it with magic ! " " But until then , " George said , sitting on the table . eat and foot on it , " we ' ll see you play the right wing - as usual . " " You made me do it ! " said Ron angrily , sucking his bare fingers . its . " You wait , when I'm seventeen - " " I'm sure you ' ll surprise us with unbelievable magical skills so far , " Fred said as he yawned . Ronald , " George said , " what's up , we heard Ginny talk about you and a girl named - or our information is wrong - Lavender Brown ? " Ron blushed slightly , but did not show up as he leaned on the Brussels sprouts . " Take care of their business . " " What a shame , " Fred said . " I do not know what you think of them . 
No , what we want to know is ... how does it happen ? " " What do you mean ? " Did she have an accident or something ? " " What ? " Well , how could she handle such great brain damage ? 
Be careful there ! " Mrs. Weasley stepped right in to see Ron throw a knife at Fred , Fred immediately turned it into a paper plane with a sluggish slug . " Ron ! " she said furiously . " Never let her see the knife thrown again ! " I will not , " said Ron , " let me see , " he whispered , and turned his head to the Bruxelles . " Fred , George , I'm sorry , my dear , Remus will come tonight , Bill will share the room with two children . " No problem , " George said . 
" Because Charlie does not go home , Harry and Ron will be on the rooftop , and if Fleur is in the same room with Ginny - " " - this would make Ginny's Gnome - " Fred muttered . " Everyone will be comfortable , " said Mrs. Weasley , " no matter what , they will sleep . " " Percy's face is not ugly ? " Fred asked . 
Mrs. Weasley said before answering . " He's the stupidest man in the world , " Fred said as Mrs. Weasley got out of the kitchen . " Or at least one of them . " Well , let's go , George . "" What did you do ? " Ron asked . " Why do not you help us with this heap ? 
You just need to wipe the chopsticks and then we will also be free ! "" No , I do not think we can do it , " Fred said earnestly . " This is a personality - building lesson , learning how to make a cut without using magic will help you understand the Muggle problem . Squib and Ron , if you want people to help you , " George added , throwing the paper plane at Ron , " do not throw the knife at them . 
But suggest hints . 
We have to go to the village , there are many beautiful girls at the news stand , who always said that our trump card is wonderful ... 
, like real magic ... 
"" Yeah , " Ron said gloomily , looking at Fred and George across the covered patio . " The pictures only need ten seconds and we can go together too . " I can not , " said Harry . " I promised Dumbledore I would not wander out here . "" Oh , " Ron said . 
He cut a few more cabbage and said , " Will you tell Dumbledore what you've heard Snape and Malfoy talking to ? " " Oh , " said Harry . " I ' ll tell everyone who can stop this , 
And Dumbledore was the head of the list . 
I will tell your father . " Sorry you did not hear what Malfoy really did . " You can not say it , do you ? That was the whole point , it refused to tell Snape . " The two took a pause , then Ron said , " So , you know what they're going to say ? 
My father and Dumbledore and everyone else . 
They will say that Snape does not really want to help Malfoy but he just wants to find out what Malfoy must do . "" They do not believe him , " said Harry brightly . " No one could play the good , even Snape . " Um ... I just thought that . " Said Ron . 
Harry turned to face him , frowning . " You think you're right , are not you ? " " Oh , of course ! " Ron said quickly . " I seriously think so ! 
But they are convinced Snape is a member of the Society , right ? " Harry did not say anything , this was almost a protest of his evidence , and he could hear Hermione's suggestion : " Harry , apparently , he pretended to offer help so he could . Can Malfoy tell the task that it will do ... " This is a very clear picture , anyway it did not have a chance to tell Hermione what he heard it . 
She lost after Slughorn's party before she returned or it was angered McLaggen to announce she had gone to bed before she returned to the common room . 
When it and Ron left school to go to the page at the next day's casket , it did not have time to say Christmas greetings to her and told her important news when they came back after holiday season . 
It is absolutely certain that she heard it ; Ron and Lavender did not say good bye at the time . 
Even Hermione could not admit that : Malfoy was supposed to do something , and Snape knew , so Harry felt absolutely right to say , " I told you so . , " he said something like that to Ron . 
Harry had no chance to talk to Mr. Weasley , who was working long hours at the Ministry of Magic , until Christmas Eve . 
The Weasley family and their guests were sitting in the living room , where Ginny had a very messy decor that looked like it was sitting on paper napkins . 
Fred , George , Harry and Ron were the only ones who knew the angel at the top of the tree was actually the garden clown who had bitten Fred's ankles as he was dragging the carrots for use . Christmas dinner . 
Make it dull , gilt , wearing a skirt spread with small wings glued to the back , it glared at the little ones , it was the worst angel ever seen , with a big black head like potatoes and leafy feathers . 
They had to listen to the singer Mrs. Weasley liked , Celestina Warbeck on the Christmas radio show , her voice louder from the radio . 
Fleur , who claims that Celestina is bored , sits in the corner of the room saying that Mrs. Weasley scowls her wand at the volume button , so Celestina's voice is louder and louder . 
Under the cover of the jazz song " A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love " , Fred and George started playing explosions with Ginny . 
Ron shot stealthy glances at Bill and Fleur , hoping to find a gift . 
Meanwhile , Lupine Remus , who looked thinner , more chic than before , was sitting by the fireplace , staring inside without even hearing Celestinas ' voice . 
Oh , come here and stir your cauldron , And if you do it right , I ' ll make you boil with the hot , hot love to keep me warm tonight . 
" We jumped when we were eight ! " Mrs. Weasley said , wiping her eyes with a knit sweater . " Do you remember , Arthur ? " " Oh ? " Mr. Weasley said , he was peeling fruit . " Yeah ... great melody ... " With his efforts , he straightened up , looking at Harry , who was sitting next to him . " I'm sorry about this , " he said , nodding toward the radio as Celestina started the chorus . " It will end soon . " " It's okay , " said Harry , grinning . " The work in the Ministry of Magic is very busy ? " " Very busy , " Mr. Weasley said . " I do not mind if you have to rummage around , but because of the three arrests you made in these last two months , I suspect one of them is actually the Death Eater - do not repeat it . Harry , " he added , looking as if he had just suddenly awakened . " They do not keep Stan Shunpike , are you ? " Asked Harry . " You are not like that , " Mr. Weasley said . " Uncle Dumbledore tried to ask Scrimgeour's direct help for Stan's story . 
... I mean , all those who actually talked to him all agreed that he was just like a Death Eater , as well as a whip ... but high ranking officials wanted to see This is as they have progressed , and the ' three arrests ' sounded better than the ' three wrongful arrests and release ' ... but again , this is top secret . "" I will not say anything , " said Harry . 
She paused for a moment , wondering what was the best way to start what she wanted to say ; When it was finished , Celestina Warbeck started a ballad called ' You Charmed the Heart , Right Out of Me ' . " Uncle Weasley , do you remember telling me to you at the station when we got on the train to school ? " " You checked , Harry , " said Mr. Weasley . " You came to Malfoy's house to search , but nothing should have been there , the whole thing and the whole thing . " " Yes , I know , you see in the prophet that you have found ... But there is something else ... well , something very ... " And it told Weasley what he had heard between Malfoy and Snape . 
When he told her , he saw Lupine turn his head slightly and look at him ... listening to his words . 
When it was finished , everyone was silent , except Celestina was chanting . 
Oh my good heart , where is it gone ? 
It just left me a mantra ... " Is that just a thought that comes to mind in my head , Harry , " said Mr. Weasley , " that Snape is just a pretend - ? " So , he can find the task that Malfoy must do ? " Harry said quickly . " Yes , I think you said that . 
But how do we know ? " That's not what we need to know , " Lupine suddenly said . 
He turned his back to the fireplace and faced Harry and Mr. Weasley . " That's Dumbledore's job . 
Dumbledore trusted Snape , and that was enough for all of us . "" But , " said Harry , " maybe - maybe Dumbledore is wrong about Snape - "" Everybody says that , a lot of times . 
It was reported that Dumbledore had decided to believe or disbelieve . 
I believe , and so , I believe Severus . "" But Dumbledore can be mistaken , " Harry argued , " you said so because you believe it . 
And he - " He looked straight into Lupine's eyes - " do you really like Snape ? "" I do not like or hate Severus , " Lupine said . " No , Harry , I'm telling you the truth , " he added , seeing Harry's expression of suspicion . " We will never be friends . Perhaps , after all that has happened between James , Sirius and Severus , it has a lot of bitterness . 
But I have not forgotten the whole school year I taught at Hogwarts , Severus had waxed Wolfsbane for me every month , so perfect that I did not have to suffer as I used to . be on the full moon day . " But he accidentally revealed that he was a werewolf , so he had to leave school ! " Harry said angrily . 
Lupine shrugged . " This will never be the same again . 
We all know he wants to teach our subject , but he can do much worse for us by forging our feet . 
He kept me healthy . 
I must be grateful . " Maybe he did not dare to ruin his leg when Dumbledore was always close to him ! " I have resolutely hated him , Harry , " Lupine said with a weak smile . " And I understand , with James your father , and with Sirius your godfather , my heir . their prejudices . 
Anyway , let me tell Dumbledore what I just told you and Arthur , but do not expect him to have the same opinion about you , and do not expect him to be surprised about What are you talking about ? That might be the order Dumbledore asked Severus to ask Malfoy . " ... and now I've torn it to you thank you for returning my heart ! 
Celestina finished her song with a long and high note and a big applause came from the radio , where Mrs Weasley was engaging . " Do not you snort ? " Fleur said loudly . " Thank you , it's so damn good - " " We make a cup of wine ? " Mr. Weasley asked loudly , jumping up . " Who wants a cup of wine ? " " Where are you at that late hour ? " Harry asked Lupine as Mr. Weasley was pouring egg whites , the rest of whom were engrossed in conversation . " Yeah , I'm in the basement , " Lupine said . " Almost so , that's why I can not write , Harry , send me a letter that could be lost . " " What do you mean ? " " I live with my friends , like me , " Lupine said . " The werewolves , " he added , as Harry expressed a puzzled expression . " They are Voldemort's clique . 
Dumbledore needs a spy and we are there and we ... do it . " He said bitterly , and perhaps he recognized , so he laughed warmly and continued , " I do not complain ; This is a necessary job and no one can do it better than me . 
Anyway , it's hard to get their trust . 
I had to endure the obvious manifestation of trying to live in the wizarding community , where I saw where they evaded conventional society and lived on the fringe , stealing - and sometimes killing - to have a meal " Why did they like Voldemort ? "" They thought that under his command they would have a better life , " Lupine said . " And it's hard to argue with Greyback there ... "" Who is Greyback ? " Have not you heard about it yet ? " Lupine clutched his hands tightly to his lap . " Fenrir Greyback was , perhaps , the wildest wolf alive today . 
It honors this as a mission in life to bite and harm as many people as possible ; It wants to create a sufficient number of werewolves to defeat the witch . 
Voldemort had promised it in exchange for his obedience . 
Greyback is a kid when he returns . 
Biting the children , he says , nourishes them away from their parents , teaching them to hate the witches . 
Voldemort threatens to free those little boys and girls ; And that is the threat always brings good results . " Lupine stopped and said , " It's Greyback , who bites me . " " What ? " Said Harry , surprised . " When - you mean when you were a kid ? " 
" Right . 
My father suggested it . 
I do not know , for a very long time , the identity of the werewolf attacked me ; I felt sorry for it , thinking that it can not control myself , I know that feeling when the transformation . 
But Greyback is not like that . 
When the moon is full , it approaches the victim , ensuring that the distance is close enough to attack . 
It calculates the whole . 
And this is who Voldemort used to be the leader of the werewolf . 
We can not pretend that the purpose of the logical debate between us and Greyback is to oppose Greyback's assertion that werewolves are bloody , that we are forced to take revenge on normal humans . " But normal teacher ! " Harry just said yes - there was a problem - " Lupine laughed . " Sometimes I remind myself of James . 
I call it a ' rabbit problem ' . 
Many people have been very impressed when we have a rabbit . " He took a glass of wine from Mr. Weasley and said thanks , looking a little gleeful , while Harry felt a little amused . 
The mention of his father recently reminded him that it was something he was hoping to ask Lupine . " Have you heard of someone called Prince of Tzu ? " " What is Lai ? " " Prince , " said Harry , looking closely at him for a sign of recognition . " There are no wizards , " Lupine said , and laughed . " Is that a title you think people are saying about you ? 
I think the ' chosen person ' is enough . "" That's not about you ! " Prince was someone who had been to Hogwarts , who had his old book of poison . 
He filled the spell on it , the mantras he invented . 
One of them is Levicorpus - "" Well , it was the most popular mantra ever during my time at Hogwarts , " Lupine remembers . " There are a few months in my fifth year . No one can move because of being lifted up by the air of his own ankles . "" Daddy used it , " said Harry . " I see Dad at Pensieve , use it on Snape . "" You tried it by accident , as if it was a whisper , nothing really important , but he was not sure he was going to get it right , " Lupine laughed sympathetically . " Yes , " he said , " but he is not the only one . 
When we say it , it becomes widespread . 
You know how spells come into being and how to use them ... "" But that's how it was invented when you were still in school , " Harry said firmly , " not really , " Lupine said . " The curses that came out and were out of fashion were like other things . " He looked at Harry's face and said softly , " James has pure blood , Harry , and I swear to you that he never told us to call him Prince . " Frustrated , Harry said , " And is not that Sirius ? 
Or teacher ? " Definitely not . " Ồ . " Harry stared at the fire in the fireplace . " I just thought - he helped me a lot in the poison lessons , Prince . " How old was Harry ? " I do not know , I never tested it . " Oh , maybe it ' ll give you some evidence of the Prince's time at Hogwarts , " Lupine said . 
A moment later , Fleur imitated Celestina singing " A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love " , and was responded to , and then Mrs. Weasley signaled to the group . it goes to sleep . 
Harry and Ron climbed up the stairs to Ron's attic bedroom , where a camping bed had been added to Harry's . 
Ron almost fell asleep right away , but Harry tucked away his chest and picked up the high - level potions to read before going to bed . 
It flipped through the pages , searching , until finally finding out , on the front of the book with the date of publication . 
It's almost fifty years old . 
Both his father and his friends were not at Hogwarts fifty years ago . 
Feeling frustrated , Harry threw the book into the chest , turned off the lights , and rolled over , thinking of the werewolf , Snape , Stan Shunpike , and the Prince and finally drowned in a nervous sleep filled with horrible silhouettes . the cry of the bitten child ... " She must tease her ... " Harry woke up and began to sucker with bulging bulge at the bottom of his bed . 
He put on his glasses and looked around , the little window was almost covered with snow , and before that Ron was sitting upright on his bed and was checking on what would happen to the thick gold chain . " What does that say ? " Asked Harry . " It's a gift from Lavender , " said Ron , sounding disgusted . Does he really think he ' ll wear ... " Harry looked closer and gave a chuckle , dangling from the necklace of gold letters : " My sweetie "" Very nice , " It says , " Excellent . 
You can wear it in front of Fred and George . "" If you tell me two photos , " said Ron , slamming the necklace under his pillow , " I - I - I will - "" Are you talking to me ? " Harry said , grinning . " Oh , come on , I'm not talking . " Why would she think she likes something like this ? " Ron asked , looking shocked . " Oh , think about it , " said Harry . " Did you ever tell anyone that you liked your face out on the street with the words ' my lover ' around ? do not you ? " Eh ... we never really talked to each other , " said Ron , " What the ... " " Hugging each other ? " Said Harry , " well , " said Ron . 
He hesitated and said , " Are not Hermione really together with McLaggen ? " " I do not know , " said Harry . " They came together at Slughorn's party , but I did not think that much . " Ron looked a little louder and then picked up his socks . 
Harry's gift consisted of a large yellow Snitch - shaped sweater on the front by Weasley herself , a large box of Wizard Wheezes from Weasley twins , a small canister with a musty smell . with the label written to the master , Kreacher . 
Harry stared at him . " Do you think it's safe to open it ? " He asked . " Maybe anything dangerous , all the letters and presents have been checked by the Ministry of Magic , " Ron replied , though his eyes looked suspiciously at the box . " I did not give Kreacher anything . 
Do people usually give Christmas presents to their elves ? " Harry asked , opening the box carefully . " Only Hermione , " said Ron , " but we wait and see what it is before you feel guilty . " A second later , Harry yelled and jumped out of his camping bed ; The box is filled with maggots . " Very nice , " said Ron , chuckling . " Very thoughtful . " " I'd rather get them than a chain , " said Harry , making Ron pause . 
Everyone was wearing a new sweater when they were having a Christmas Eve dinner , except for Fleur ( the only one not because Mrs. Weasley thought it was a waste ) and Mrs. Weasley herself was joking around . Dressed in a new black - and - white sorcerer's helmet glistened by things that looked like tiny star - shaped diamonds , and a beautiful gold necklace . " Fred and George gave it to him ! 
Are they beautiful ? "" Well ... we thought we appreciated her much more , Mom , now we're washing our socks , " George said , waving . "" Harry , there's a maggot in your hair , " Ginny said cheerfully , across the table to pick up the maggot ; Harry felt like a goose in his neck that he did not know what to do with one . maggots . " Oh , that's fine , " Fleur said and shivered a little . " Is not it ? " Said Ron . " Meat soup , Fleur ? " 
In the eagerness to help her , she collided making the soup dish ; Bill waved the soup wand up obediently back to the fork . " You're as bad as Tonks , " Fleur told Ron after she kissed him on thanksgiving . " She always struggled - " " I invited her dear Tonks to play today , " Mrs. Weasley said , putting the carrot down unnecessarily and glaring at Fleur . " But she will not come . 
Have you talked to her , Remus ? "" No , I do not have much contact with people , " Lupine said . " But Tonks has her family , is not she ? " Well , " Mrs. Weasley said . " Maybe . 
I have the feeling that she is going to eat Christmas by herself . " She looked at Lupine nervously as if Fleur had become her daughter - in - law instead of Tonks completely at fault , and Harry , who was staring at Fleur , was feeding a piece of turkey from her plate , while Mrs. Weasley is struggling for something without hope of success . 
Anyway , he reminded her of the question of visiting Tonks , and who better to ask than Lupine , who knows all about Patronus . " Tonks ' Patronus has changed shape , " she told him . " Snape said so . 
I do not know what happened . 
Why did his Patronus change ? " Lupine chewed turkey and swallowed before speaking slowly , " sometimes ... a strong shock ... emotionally rising ... "" It looks big , and has four legs , " said Harry , A thought came and he lowered his voice . " Hu ... can not - ? " Brother Arthur ! " Mrs. Weasley said suddenly . 
She stood up , her wand placed on her heart , she stared out the kitchen window . " Brother Arthur - that's Percy ! " " What ? " Mr. Weasley looked around . 
Everyone looked out the window ; Ginny straightened up to make it easier to see . There , for sure , was Percy Weasley , striding across a snow - covered courtyard , his horns glittering in the sun . 
Anyway , he does not go alone . " Arthur , it's - it's with the Minister ! " And surely , the man Harry once saw in the Daily Prophet was with Percy , slightly limp , with gray mane hair , and his black coat was covered with snow . 
Before everyone could say anything , before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do more than look stunned , the back door opened and Percy stood there . 
One minute of silence . 
Then Percy said hardly , " Merry Christmas , Mother . " " Oh Percy ! " Mrs. Weasley said and ran to hug him . Rufus Scrimgeour stopped at the entrance , he stood with his stick and smiled . 
" Please forgive this visit , " he said as Mrs. Weasley looked at him , smiling brightly . " Percy and I are - working in the neighborhood , everybody knows - and he can not stop visiting everyone . " But Percy did not want to welcome anyone else in the family . 
He stood up like a log , looked embarrassed , and stared at everyone . 
Mr. Weasley , Fred and George watched him with a cold stone face . Come in and sit , Minister ! " Mrs. Weasley raised her hand to speak , adjusting her hat straight . " Do you use a little purkey or tooding ... I mean - " " No , no , Molly , " Scrimgeous said . 
Harry guessed that he had asked her name Percy before coming here . " I do not want to bother , I did not come if Percy did not ask very well to meet with everyone ... " " Oh Perce ! " Said Mrs. Weasley , kissing Percy . 
" ... We can only come in five minutes , so I ' ll take a walk in the garden while chatting with Percy . 
No , I can not assure you that I do not want to interfere with my family ! 
Well , if anyone wants to guide me on this cute garden ... 
Ah , this boy is eating here , why do not you walk around with me ? " The air at the dining table changed . 
Everyone looked at Scrimgeous and Harry . 
No one seems to think Scrimgeous's pretensions are that he does not know Harry's name enough , and because then Ginny , Fleur and George have just finished eating . " Yes , okay , " said Harry , mopping up the silence . 
It's not an idiot , with all the Scrimgeous stuff they say they just came to this area , that Percy wants to visit family , this is the main reason they came here so Scrimgeous can talk . separate with Harry . " That's going to be fine , " he whispered as he passed Harry , who was almost half - faced . " Well , " he added , then Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak . " That's great ! " Said Scrimgeous , turning his back to the door with Harry . " We just go around the garden , go to Percy . 
People go on ! " Harry stepped out into the Weasley's lush garden , the Scrimgeous snow covered his limp . 
Harry knew , he used to be the head of the Dark Struggle Headquarters ; He was very strong and courageous , unlike Mr. Fudge's fat cocktail hat . " Nice , " said Scrimgeous , stopping at the fence around the garden overlooking the snow - covered lawn and trees indistinguishable . " It's too fast . " Harry did not say anything . 
It can be said that Scrimgeous is looking at it . " I wanted to see you for a long time , " Scrimgeous said . " Do you know ? " " No , " Harry said honestly . " Oh , yes , it's been a long time . 
But Dumbledore kept me very close , " said Scrimgeous . " Of course , of course , of course what I've been through ... especially what happened in the Ministry of Magic ... " Wait for a moment for Harry to speak , but he did not open his mouth , so he continued , " I had hoped to have a chance to talk to you since I took office , but Dumbledore was - say - prevent this . " Harry did not say anything , just waiting . " The rumor was spreading ! " Well , of course , we both know how the story was distorted ... the whispered whisper of the prophetic sphere ... about being a ' " ... They're getting close to the point , Harry thought , that's why the Scrimgeous came here . " I'm sure Dumbledore was discussing this with me , right ? " Harry considered whether he should lie . 
He looked down at the ghostly trails surrounding the flower beds , traversing the foot where Fred had caught the ghost , who was now wearing a skirt spread over the top of the Christmas tree . 
In the end it decided to tell the truth ... a little truth . " Yes , you and I have talked about this . " " So you , me , " said Scrimgeous . 
Harry could see that he was glancing at him , so he pretended he was paying attention to the ghost that had just popped his head out from beneath the snow covering the canopy . " What did Dumbledore say to you , Harry ? " " I'm sorry , but it's between you and me , " said Harry . 
It kept the voice as cute as possible , and Scrimgeous's voice was the same , very soft and friendly , he said , " Well , of course , if it's private then I do not have to tell you to . No ... no ... but anyway , is that really what you mean ' chosen person ' ? " Harry had to think over a few seconds before answering , You really do not understand what your mind is , Minister . "" Oh , of course , for me , this is a huge problem , " Scrimgeour said and laughed . " But for the wizarding community ... it's a perception , is not it ? That's what people believe is important . " Harry did not say anything . 
He thought it had dimmed what they were aiming for , but it would not have helped Scrimgeour get there . 
The ghost was digging for the root , and Harry kept his eyes fixed on it . " People believe you are the ' Picked Up ' you see , " said Scrimgeour . " They think I'm a hero - of course , you're right , Harry , no matter how many times you face Keeper - Do not Call - Roa ? 
Well , anyway , " he continued , without waiting for an answer , " it is important that you are the symbol of the hope of so many people , Harry . 
The idea that there is someone who can , chosen , to destroy the He - Do - Call - Name , of course , has made everyone excited . 
But I can not help but I know that I can imagine this , I can think about it , oh , it oyster as responsibility , alongside the Ministry of Magic to help people peace of mind . " The ghost had just dug a hole to catch the worm , jerking it away to get the worm out of the snow . 
Harry remained silent for a long time , and Scrimgeour continued , looking down at the ghost , " This one is funny , is not it ? 
But what do you mean , Harry ? "" I do not exactly understand what you want , " Harry said slowly . 
What is that ? "" Well , yeah , nothing heavy , I assure you , " said Scrimgeour . " If people suddenly find me suddenly coming out of the Ministry of Magic , for example , it would impress . with everyone . 
And of course , while you're there , you ' ll have plenty of opportunity to talk to Gawain Robards , my successor as the Head of the Dark Struggle . 
Dolores Umbridge has told me that he is cherishing his desire to become the Dark Knight . 
Well , that can be easily arranged ... " Harry felt anger rise in his stomach . 
Is Dolores Umbridge still working at the Ministry of Magic ? " So basically , " he said as if he just wanted to clarify something , " do you want to be gay by the way you work for the Ministry ? " " It will make people reassure you that you care very much . " Harry , " said Scrimgeour , sounding as if to reassure Harry that she agreed quickly . " ' Picked up , ' you know ... it just makes people hope , good things are happening ... " " But if you go out and get in , " said Harry . , trying to keep her voice friendly , " is it like you approve of what the Department is doing ? " " Oh , " Scrimgeour said , a little worried , " well , that's just some reason . We want - "" No , I do not think this is a success , " Harry said cheerfully . " You see 
I do not like what the ministry is doing . 
The arrest of Stan Shunpike . " Scrimgeour did not say anything for a moment but his face was sharp . " I'm not in the mood to understand you , " he said , not succeeding in keeping anger out of his voice as Harry did . " This is a dangerous time . 
Violations should be arrested . 
I'm only sixteen - "" Dumbledore is a lot older than sixteen , and he does not think Stan should be put in jail for Azkaban , " said Harry . " He just looked at Stan as a human , just like like watching me like a good guy . " They look at each other , long and hard . 
Scrimgeour finally said without a slight pretense , " I understand . 
My favorite - like your hero , Dumbledore - does not cooperate with ministry right ? " I do not want to be used , " said Harry . " Some people will say it's a responsibility when the Department uses them ! " Yes , and others say their responsibility is to test that whoever is really the Death Eater before kicking people in jail , " said Harry , now his anger was . " He's doing what Barty Crouch did . 
He never understood right , he people , right ? 
Just as in Fudge's time , pretending that everything was fine while people were being killed right under his nose , or in his day , kicked innocent people into jail and tried to pretend that they were Have the ' selected ' work for you ! "" So are not you the ' chosen person ' ? " Scrimgeour said , " I do not think it means nothing to you . " Said Harry , laughing bitterly . " Anyway , it's not your job . "" I do not mean that , " Scrimgeous said hastily . " It's so lively - "" No , that's a frank saying , " said Harry . " One of the most honest things he told me . 
You do not care about me living or dying , but you are only interested in helping me convince people that you will win the war with Voldemort or not . 
I will not forget , Minister ... " He clenched his fists , and there , on the back of his hand , was a scar that Dolores Umbridge had forcibly engraved on his flesh . Lie . " I do not remember that he broke into my defense when I tried to tell people that Voldemort was back . 
The ministry did not appear to want to be friends last year . " They stood there in silence as cold as the ground below them . 
The worm also removed the worm and was eating it delicious , toward the branches of the bean . " What is Dumbledore's mission ? " Scrimgeour asked gruffly . " Where did he go during his absence at Hogwarts ? " " Do not know , " said Harry . " And you will not tell me if you know , " said Scrimgeour , " right ? " " Yes , I will not say , " said Harry . " Well , I ' ll have to see if I can figure it out myself . " " Just try it , " Harry said coldly . " But he does not seem to be so much better than Fudge , so I think he should learn from him . 
He tried to harass Hogwarts . 
He might have noticed that he was no longer the minister but Dumbledore continued to be the president . 
I will ignore Dumbledore if I'm him . " A very long silence . " Well , I clearly understood that he trained me very well , " Scrimgeour said , his eyes cold and uncomfortable behind the wide - eyed glass . " Dumbledore is very perfect person , is not it Potter ? "" Yes , I think so , " said Harry . " It's nice that we're done . " Then she turned her back to the Minister of Magic , striding back and forth in the house .

Chapter 17 The Blurry Memory 
In the late afternoon , a few days after the new year , Harry , Ron , and Ginny stood in front of the fireplace in the kitchen to return to Hogwarts . 
The department has established connections from there to the Floo network to get students to the campus quickly and safely . 
Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say goodbye to the kids , and Mr. Weasley , Fred , George , Bill and Fleur were all working . 
Mrs. Weasley cried in farewell . 
Admittedly , it is very difficult to catch her recently ; She cried a lot since Percy rushed out of the house on Christmas Day with glasses of glazed radish ( which Fred , George , and Ginny were responsible for . ) " Do not cry , mother . " Ginny said , panting Mrs. Weasley's back as she was crying on her shoulder . " Everything will be okay ... " " That's right , there's no need to worry about us , " said Ron , accepting his mother's teary kiss on his cheek , " and for Percy too . 
He is just a fool , nothing to lose his mother . Mrs. Weasley cried more than ever when she hugged Harry in her arms . " Promise me that you will take care of yourself . 
Avoid trouble ... "" You always try Uncle Weasley , " said Harry , " I like a quiet life , I know you already . " She smiled in tears and stepped back . " Take care , all of you ... " Harry stepped into the green flame and shouted , " Hogwarts ! " It had a fleeting glimpse of the Weasley kitchen and Mrs. Weasley's watery face before sinking into the flames , swiveling swiftly , it had the faintest impression of the other witches ' rooms . , but also out of sight before he could look at it , then slowed down , finally stopping firmly in Professor McGonagall's office . 
She barely looked up from the desk as she climbed out of the fireplace . " Hello Potter . 
Try not to fall ash carpet . "" Yes , Professor . " Harry put on his glasses and stroked his hair straight as Ron was spinning in front of him . 
When Ginny arrived , the three of them pulled out of Miss McGonagall's office and headed for Gryffindor Tower . 
Harry looked out the window of the corridor they passed ; The sun was sinking under the snow covered ground , but also thicker than at the Burrow Farm . In the distance , he saw Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin . " Baubles , " Ron said confidently as they reached Mrs. Beo , who now looked pale than usual and frowned . " No , " she said . " What's wrong ? " " There's a new code , " she said . " And please do not scream . " " But we were not here , how did ... ? " " Harry ! 
Ginny ! " Hermione was hurrying toward them , her face turning and wearing a robe , a hat and gloves . " I just returned a few hours . 
I just came to see Hagrid and Buck ... I mean Witherings , " she said , not a bit . " Happy Christmas ? "" Oh , " Ron said suddenly , " a lot of things , Rufus Scrim ... "" I have this for you 
Harry and , " said Hermione , not looking at Ron or signaling that she heard him . " Oh , wait ... the password . 
Abstinence . "" Exactly , " Mrs. Beo said in a tired voice and pulled forward , revealing the portrait hole . " What is she doing ? Obviously she was too comfortable , " said Hermione , her eyes widened as she entered the packed classroom . " You and your friend Violet have drunk all the wine in the paintings . Tu drunk in the corridor of Chou . 
Anyway ... " The girl rummaged in her pocket for a moment , then pulled out a parchment with Dumbledore's letter on it . " That's great , " said Harry , opening it immediately to see that . The next lesson with Dumbledore was planned the following evening . " I have a lot to say to you ... 
and you too . 
Sit down ... " But at that moment there was a loud cry , " Won - Won " and Lavender Brown did not know how to jump into Ron's arms . 
Some eyewitnesses laughed ; Hermione laughed and said , " There is one here ... 
Have a look no Ginny ? "" No , I said you ' ll see Dean , " Ginny said , although Harry could not help but feel that she was not very enthusiastic . 
Despite Ron and Lavender getting together in a standing boxing match , Harry led Hermione to an empty table . " What's your Christmas ? " " Oh , well , " she shrugged . " Nothing special . 
How at home Won - Won how ? " Behold , Hermione , you can not ... " " No , I can not , " she said apathetic . " So do not ask . "" I think , maybe , you know , this Christmas ... "" It was Mrs. Beo who had been drinking a large jar for 500 years , Harry , not me . 
What is the important news you want to tell me ? " She was too aggressive to argue at the moment , so Harry ignored the subject of Ron and recounted all he heard in the conversation between Malfoy and Snape . 
When it was over , Hermione had been thinking for a long time and said , " You do not think ... ? " " ... you got the help of Malfoy talking about what he was doing right ? " " Oh yes , " said Hermione . " Ron's father and Lupine thought so , " Harry said reluctantly . " But this completely proves that Malfoy is planning something , he can not negate this . " " Oh , I can not , " she answered slowly . " And it's acting under Voldemort's orders , like I said ! " " Hmm ... did any of you actually mention the name Voldemort ? " Harry's expression was solemn , trying to remember . again . " I'm not sure ... 
Snape said ' your master , ' and who else was there ? "" I do not know , " Hermione bit her lip . " Maybe his father ? " She glanced across the room , obviously in her thoughts , not even paying attention to the lavender Lavender . " What about Lupine ? " Not so good , " said Harry , and it told her everything about Lupine's mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing . " Have you ever heard of Fenrir Greyback ? To "" Well , I heard ! " Hermione tugged at me . " And you heard Harry too ! " When do you , the History of the Wizard ? 
You know I never heard ... "" No , not the History of Magic - Malfoy threatened Borgin with Kim ! " Said Hermione . " At Knockturn Knob , you do not remember ? 
He told him 
Borgin that Greyback is an old friend of the family and that he will check regularly Borgin's work schedule ! " Harry gasped at her words . " I forgot ! 
But this further proves Malfoy is Death Eater , otherwise how can it contact Greyback and tell him what to do ? "" This is quite suspicious , " said Hermione . " Unless ... "" Oh , look , " said Harry , annoyed , " you can not fight this ! " Hmmm ... there is a possibility that it is a false threat . " You can not believe it , that's right , " said Harry , shaking his head . " We ' ll know who's right . 
You will admit your mistake Hermione , like the Ministry of Magic . Oh yeah , I have a fight with Rufus Scrimgeour too ... " And the rest of that evening was kindly dismissed by Secretary of Magic Hermione , just like Ron , thinking that after all the Department had made Harry suffer a whole year , they would not dare ask it for any help . 
The new semester started the next morning with a pleasant surprise in the sixth year : a large sign posted at the notice board in the common room from last night . 
LESSONS LEARNED If you are 17 years old , or 17 years old on or before August 31 of this year , you are eligible to take a 12 - week , 12 - week , Turkish Ministry of the Arts . 
Sign down if you want to join . 
Price : 12 Galleon . 
Harry and Ron enter into the crowded crowd around the bulletin board and take turns writing the name at the bottom of the table . 
Ron was taking the pen to sign after Hermione , and Lavender crawled behind him , clutching his eyes and saying , " Guess who , Won - Won ? " Harry turned to see Hermione running away ; It catches up with her , does not wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender , but in the surprise of him , Ron has caught up with two , just a paragraph from the portraiture , red ear Its up and its emotions are very upset . 
Without a word , Hermione hurried up to go with Neville . " So ... terribly , " said Ron , his voice so casual that Harry did not dare to talk about what had just happened . " Seems kind of funny ? " " I do not know , " said Harry . " I could have done better myself , I was not so excited when Dumbledore sent me away . " " I forgot that you did it ... it's best to go through the test in one go . First , " Ron looked worried . " Fred and George have done it , " " What's wrong with Charlie ? " " Yes , but Charlie is bigger than me . " Ron raised his hand around his body like he was like a gorilla - " Fred and George do not do much ... at least in front of him ... "" When do I have to take the test ? "" As soon as I'm 17 , for me it's just a month . Come on ! "" That's right , but you will not be able to reach Turkey here in this castle ... "" Is not that the problem ? 
Everyone will know that I can tan any time I want . " Not only did Ron seem to be excited by the prospect of Turkic Enchantment . 
That day there was a lot of whispers about the upcoming lessons ; Being able to go away and reappear immediately is highly appreciated . " It does not matter how great it is when we just need to ... " Seamus snapped at the disappearance . " My cousin Fergus did just to tease me , just wait until I can ... 
He will never have a moment of peace again ... " 
Immersed in the illusion of this bright prospect , it shook the wand so excitedly that instead of turning out a clean water tank - the goal of today's Chakra lesson - it made a faucet the force that bounced up on the ceiling and hit Flitwick's face . " Harry was terribly disturbed , " Ron said to Seamus , who was a little flustered , after Professor Flitwick dried himself with a wand and commented to Seamus , " I'm a witch . Not a monkey with a stick . "" Dum Master ... 
Oh ... let's go with him . landslide Together , you know . " Wow ! " Seamus whispered , and he , Dean , with Neville clawed his head to hear how it felt . 
For the rest of that day , Harry was besieged by other sixty - year - olds who demanded a sense of humor . 
All of them seemed more frightened , than shunned , when it told them how uncomfortable the spell was , and it still answered the detailed questions at ten o ' clock that evening , Until it was forced to lie , it had to pay a book for the library , so that it could arrive in time for the lesson with Dumbledore . 
The lights in Dumbledore's office were lit up , portraits of old principals still snoring in their frames , and the Symphony Again was ready on the table . 
Dumbledore's hands are on either side of him , his right hand still black and sunburned as usual . 
It did not seem to be healed , and Harry wondered if it was the 100 th time , that what could have caused such a traumatic event , but he did not ask ; Dumbledore said that it would eventually know and in any case it had other topics to say . 
But before Harry could talk about Snape and Malfoy , Dumbledore said . " Did I hear you met the Minister of Magic in Christmas ? " " Yes , " said Harry . " He was not happy to see me . " " Yes , " Dumbledore sighed . " He was not happy to see me either . 
We must try not to be engulfed in our suffering Harry , but to fight to the end . " Harry grinned . " He wants you to tell the wizarding community that the Department has done a great job . " Dumbledore laughed . " That was Fudge's opinion , you know . 
On the last day in the office , as he was struggling to grasp his place desperately , he wanted to see her , hoping that she could support him ... "" After all that Mr. Fudge did you last year ? " Harry was angry . " After Umbridge ? " I told Cornelius there was no chance , but that thought did not leave him when he left the office . 
Within a few hours after Scrimgeour took office we met and he suggested we arrange a date with him . "" That's why I argued ! " Harry blurted out , " this was reported in the Prophet Daily . "" The Prophet often has to post the truth , " Dumbledore said , " unless it is unfortunate . That's why we quarrel . 
Well , it seems that Rufus has finally found a way to get to me . "" He denounced the child . " Completely dominated by Dumbledore . "" He was just too real . " I told him that was so . "" Dumbledore was about to open his mouth to say something and then shut up . 
Next to Harry , the phoenix fawkes uttered a soft , soft cry . 
In Harry's extreme shame , he suddenly realizes that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes 
He was staring at his knees . 
When Dumbledore said , anyway , his voice was calm . " I'm very touched by Harry . " " Scrimgeour wanted to know where he was going when he was not at Hogwarts , " said Harry , his eyes still on his knees . " Oh , he was so curious about that , " Dumbledore said , sounding happy now , and Harry thought it was safe to look up now . " He tried to follow me . 
That's really funny . 
He gave Dawlish our foot . It's not good at all . 
I was forced to cast a spell on Dawlish once ; Then we do so with a great remorse . "" People still do not know where to go ? " Harry asked , hoping to learn more about this intriguing subject , but Dumbledore just laughed through his half - moon glass . " No , they do not know , and it's not the time for me . need to know . 
Now , we suggest that we start , unless there is something else ... ? "" Actually , sir , " said Harry , " that's about Malfoy and Snape . "" Professor Snape Harry . " Yes , sir . 
I overheard them at Professor Slughorn's party ... in fact , they followed in their footsteps ... " Dumbledore heard Harry's story with a calm face . 
When Harry finished he did not say anything for a moment , then said , Thank you for telling me this , Harry , but I advise you to forget about this . 
I do not think that's so important . " Does not matter ? " Harry doubted suspiciously . " Professor , do you understand ... ? "" Yes , Harry , I'm lucky to have an incredible mind so I understand all that I say , " Dumbledore said , a bit tough . " I think you even think we understand the story . This is more than you . 
Again , I am very happy to believe in you , but let me assure you once again that you have never told me something that can make you uneasy . " Harry sat quietly in shock , staring at Dumbledore . 
What happened ? 
Does this mean that Dumbledore asked Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing , that he had heard all that Harry had said about Snape ? 
Or are you really worried about this , but try to show nothing ? " Oh my lord , " said Harry , with a voice that he hoped would be gentle and polite , " do you still believe in ... ? " " I was more than enough to answer the question . That's it , " Dumbledore said , but he did not show any extra tolerance . " My answer remains unchanged . " " I suppose it is not , " said a distant voice ; Phineas Negellus is obviously just pretending to sleep . 
Dumbledore ignored him . " And now , Harry , I really suggest we get started . 
I have more important things to discuss with you tonight . " Harry sat there , boiling . 
What if it refused to change the subject , if it still insists on talking about the case of Malfoy ? 
As if he had read Harry's mind , Dumbledore shook his head . " Ah Harry , this came out many times , even among best friends ! 
Each of us thinks that what they say is the most important , more than anything else that others contribute ! " I do not think what you say is not important , sir , " Harry said firmly . 
" Well , you're right , because it does not matter , " Dumbledore said . " I have two memories that I need to see tonight , both of which are due to great hardship , and the second one , as we think , is the most important thing we can get . " Harry did not say what about this whole thing ; He is still angry by the reception that his self - esteem has received , but he does not know what it will gain if he argues . " Come on , " said Dumbledore , in a jubilant voice , " we meet tonight to continue the story of Tom Riddle , which we stopped at the previous session as it was pausing at the door of the years . Study at Hogwarts . 
I will remember how happy it was to know that I was a witch , that it had denied my presence on the trip to Alley , and that I , in turn , warned it about theft . Continuously when it comes to school . " Hmmm , the beginning of the school year has finally come , and with that , little Tom Riddle , in an old cloak , lined up with the other elders . 
It was put into the Slytherin almost immediately when the Taxonomy touched its head , " Dumbledore continued , putting his black arm toward the price where the taxon hat was stored , old and " When Riddle learned of the famous founder who could speak to Snake , it was not clear , maybe that evening . 
This makes it even more enjoyable and gives rise to a sense of self - importance . " However , if it had scared or impressed the other Slytherins in the common room , that was not known by the teachers . 
It did not show any pride or violence at all . 
As an orphaned , very rare and handsome , it naturally gained the attention and understanding of the teachers from the moment they arrived . 
It looks polite , quiet , and very craving for understanding . 
Almost everyone is impressed by it . "" Did not you tell them , sir , about what you saw at the orphanage ? " Harry asked , " No , I did not . 
Although it does not show any sinfulness , it is possible that it felt guilty about what it had shown before and tried to look good outside . 
I chose to give it a chance . " Dumbledore stopped and looked curiously at Harry , who had now opened his mouth to say , here again is Dumbledore's tendency to trust others despite the obvious evidence . Sure they do not deserve it ! 
But then Harry remembers something ... " But do not you really believe him ? 
He told me ... 
Riddle , who had escaped from the diary , said , " Dumbledore never seems to like me with other teachers . " " Let's just say that we did not consider it credible as obvious , " Dumbledore said . to speak . " I did , as I pointed out , trying to keep an eye on him , and I did . 
We can not assume that we have collected much from our observations in the first place . 
It seems very preoccupied with me ; He feels it , I'm sure , in the fear that others will know the true nature of it that it has told me a bit too much . 
He was very careful not to get so much exposure again , but it was impossible to get back what he had said in pleasure , or what Cole had told us . 
However , it had the feeling that it would never be the same as it had done to many of my colleagues . " As it progresses in layers , it gathers a group of friends who are willing to give , so I call them , with the hope of finding the right word , even though I say one . Once , Riddle clearly had no sympathy with them . 
This group has had a kind of shady operation in the castle . 
They are a collection of junk ; a mix of weak people seeking protection , 
Those who are eager to find a glory , and those who are brutally attracted to the head who can show them a more beautiful face of crime . 
In other words , they are the premise of Death Eaters , and the fact is that some of them became Death Eaters right after leaving Hogwarts . " were strictly controlled by Riddle , who had never been discovered in a crime , despite their seven - year hogwarts being marked by a number of bad events that they never clearly linked , the most horrible of all , surely , opening the door of the Confidential Chamber , which eventually led to the death of a girl . 
As you know , Hagrid was accused in that crime . " I could not collect many Riddle memories at Hogwarts , " said Dumbledore , putting his tired hands on the Sign . " Some of them knew it was arranged to talk about it , they were really scared . 
What we know is found after it left Hogwarts , after a lot of careful effort , after following in the footsteps of a few who were fooled to say , after researching the old records and asking the Muggle witness and other witches . " The people we can persuade tell us that Riddle has been obsessed by his parents , which is quite understandable , of course , has grown up in an orphanage and is clearly looking forward to it . Wish to know how it got there . 
It seemed as if he was searching in desperate for the signs of a big Tom Riddle in the rooms in the traditional room , on the list of Leaders in the old school records , even in the book on the history of the Phù Thuy . 
Eventually it had to accept the fact that his father had never been to Hogwarts . 
I believe that since then it has left that name forever , creating the name of Lord Voldemort , and began to learn about her abandoned motherhood - the woman that you still remember . had thought that it could not be a witch if she had been defeated by human shameful frailty . " All that he can rely on is just the name ' Marvolo , ' which he learned from those who ran the orphanage that it was his grandfather's name . 
Finally , after careful study , through the old books about wizarding families , it has found the existence of Slytherin blood . 
In the summer of 16 , she left the orphanage , which she later returned year after year to find Gaunt's relatives . 
And now , Harry , if you stand up ... " Dumbledore got up , and Harry saw him holding up a small jar with a sparkling , whirling memory . " I was lucky to have this memory . , " he said as he poured the flashlight into the Sign . " And you will know right now that I have it . 
Shall we go " Harry stepped up to the stone pot and leaned forward as his face sank into the surface of his memory ; it had the familiar feeling of falling through a space and stopping at a stone floor . Filthy in extreme darkness . 
It took a few moments to realize this place , just then Dumbledore landed next to it . 
Gaunt's house is actually more indescribably dirty than anywhere Harry has ever been . 
The ceiling is full of spider webs , the floor is covered with dirty soil ; The foul stinky food is on the table between a pile of rancid jars . 
The only light coming from a single candle was at the feet of a man with hair and beard so thick that Harry could not see his eyes and mouth . 
He was sitting in a wheelchair in front of the fireplace , and Harry wondered whether he was dead . 
But then a loud knock knocked the door and the man awoke , raising his wand with his right hand and a short knife with his left hand . 
The door opened . There at the door , holding an old lamp , was one 
The baby he recognized immediately : tall , red , black hair , and handsome - Voldemort as a kid . 
Voldemort's eyes moved slowly in the tent and finally found the man in the trolley . 
For a few seconds they looked at each other , then the man stood up , lots of empty jars bumping into each other at his feet and tinkering on the floor . " HEY ! " He yelled . " HEY ! " And he darted like mad at Riddle , his wand and knife raised . " Stop . " . 
Riddle says in Tramp . 
The man collapsed toward the table , pushing the bottles of mold off the floor . 
He stared at Riddle . 
Be silent for a long time when they learn each other . 
The man said before . " Can you talk about that ? " " I can say that , " Riddle said . 
He moved forward in the room , then slammed the door behind him . 
Harry could not help but feel admiration for Voldemort's complete fearlessness . 
His face was simply disgusting , and maybe , disappointing . " Where is Marvolo ? " He asked . " Dead , " said the other . " Death years ago , is not it ? " Riddle angry . " Who are you ? " " I'm Morfin , are not you ? " " Marvolo's son ? " " Of course , then ... " Morfin pulled his hair out of his dirty face . It was easy to see Riddle , and Harry saw him wearing Marvolo's black stone ring in his right hand . " I think you're a Muggle , " Morfin whispered . " You look like that Muggle guy . " " Muggle ? " Riddle said tersely . " Muggle , my sister is very fond of Muggle , who lived in a very large house , " Murfin said , and he suddenly came in between them . " You look exactly like it . 
Riddle . 
But is it much older ? 
He's older than you , now I know ... " Morfin seemed pissed and slightly sardonic , still gripping the edge of the table to stand , " He's back , see , " he added with a look . stupid . 
Voldemort looked at the Parafin as if he were judging . 
Then he stepped closer and said , " Riddle is back here ? " " Ar , she left her , and served her well , dirty marriage ! " Morfin said , vomiting on the floor . " Eat us , see , before she escapes . 
Where is Slytherin's stone , eh , Slytherin's stone ? " Voldemort did not answer . 
Morfin continues to be angry ; he scooped up the knife and shouted , " Betrayed us , she did , spoiled girl ! 
And gave birth to you , come here and ask such questions ? 
It's over , is not it ? 
It's over ... " He looked away , a bit stunned , and Voldemort stepped forward . 
When it did , an incredible darkness fell , overshadowing Voldemort's lights and Morfin's candles , overshadowing everything ... 
Dumbledore's fingers grasped Harry's hand and they were soaring up to the present . 
The dim yellow lamp in Dumbledore's office seemed to make Harry dizzy after the unbreakable darkness . " That's it ? " Said Harry immediately . " Why is it so dark , what happened ? " " Because Morfin could not remember what happened then , " said Dumbledore , only Harry sitting down in his chair . " When he woke up the next morning , he was lying on the floor , alone . 
Marvolo's ring is gone . 
" Meanwhile , in the village of Little Hangleton , a maid was running through the High Street , shouting that there were three corpses in the studio at home : old Tom Riddle and his parents . " Muggle has been embarrassed . 
As we still notice , they still do not know why the Riddle people died , for Avadu Kedavra usually leaves no mark of destruction . 
Exceptions are sitting next to me , " Dumbledore added , with a nod of Harry's scar . " The suite , on the other hand , knew at once that it was a wizard kill . 
They also knew that a Muggle - hater had a criminal record over the valley to the Riddle , who hated Muggles who had been jailed once for attacking one of those killed . " So I called Morfin up . 
They do not need to ask him , or use the Veritaserum or Legilimency spell . 
He acknowledged the murder immediately , telling the details that only killers knew . 
He was very proud , he said , because he killed the Muggles , has been waiting for a long chance . 
He returned the wand , which was immediately proved to have been used to kill the Riddle . 
And he himself accepted being sent to Azkaban without protest . 
All that made him wonder was that his father's ring had died . ' You will kill me for losing it , ' he snapped the prisoner away from time to time . He will kill me for losing the ring . 
And that was obviously the last thing he was told . 
He lived to the end of his life in Azkaban , moaning about the disappearance of Marvolo's last remnant , and was buried next to the prison , along with poor souls who were also trapped in the remains . prison wall . " So did Voldemort get Mr. Morfin's wand and use it ? " That's right , " said Dumbledore . " We have no memory of this , but we think we can be sure what happened . 
Voldemort paralyzed his uncle , took his wand , and went to the other side of the valley to go to ' the big house . ' There he killed the Muggle man who had abandoned his mother , and for sure , his Muggle grandparents too , to completely eradicate the last Riddle blood and to take revenge on his father himself . now want it . 
Then he returned to Gaunt's tent , made some complicated spells to put in his uncle's mind a little memory to do , placed Morfin's wand next to his unconscious possessor , the necklace he wore , and then left . " And Morfin never realized he did not do it ? "" Never , " said Dumbledore . " He showed , as I said , a complete and complete confession . " But you still have real memories in your head ! "" Yes , but there must be a Legilimency spell from someone who is really experienced to get it out , " Dumbledore said , " and why do people dig into Morfin's mind deeper when he Have I committed myself to sin ? 
Anyway , I was able to make a meeting with Morfin in the last weeks of his life , at the time I was trying to get a glimpse of Voldemort's past . 
I pulled out the last memory with a great hardship . 
When we see what is hidden there , we try to use it to bring Morfin out of Azkaban . 
Before the Ministry made the decision , Morfin was dead . " But how did the Ministry not realize that it was Voldemort himself who did that to Morfin ? " Harry is angry . " He was not yet an adult , was he ? 
I think they can detect the magic not yet juveniles ! " I'm close - they can detect magic , but not the one who does it . 
I will still remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for a glider that was actually made by ... " 
" Dobby , " Harry grumbled ; This injustice still bothered him . " So if people are not old and people perform magic in an older witch's house , they will not know . " " They will obviously not say who the magician is , " he said . Said Dumbledore , grinning at the look of hatred on Harry's face . " They trust the witch parents to get their children to follow them in the family . " " Hmm , that's rubbish , " Harry interrupted . " See what happened , see what happened to Mr. Morfin ! " " I agree , " Dumbledore said . " Regardless of who Morfin was , he was not worthy of death as he did , blamed for a murder he did not commit . 
But now it's too late , I want you to see another memory before we break up ... " Dumbledore drew a small glass vase from his pocket and Harry was silent at once , remembering that Dumbledore said it was the most important thing he had ever collected . 
Harry noticed that what was in the jar was quite difficult to drain into the Sign , as if it had been frozen ; Do memories get worse ? " This will not take long , " Dumbledore said as he finally managed to empty the bottle . " I ' ll come back here before I notice . 
Once again on the Sign ... " Harry again fell into the silver surface again , this time landed in front of a man he immediately recognized , it was a much younger Horace Slughorn . . 
Harry was accustomed to seeing him balding , so much so that he saw Slughorn's image with thick hair , a bright yellowish color , and a puzzled straw ; It was as if he had ruffled his hair , even though there was a Galleon bald patch on the top of his head . 
His beard , much less than today , is yellow . 
He was not as sluggish as Slughorn that Harry knew , even though the gold buttons on his embroidered waistcoat were stretched quite a lot . His small legs resting on a velvet cushion , he was sitting in a comfortable armchair , holding a small glass of wine , the other hand in a box of glass pineapples . 
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw them in Slughorn's office . 
Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn , all sitting on a stiffer and lower floor than he was , and they were all around the age of fifteen . 
Harry immediately recognized Voldemort . 
It has the most handsome face and looks most comfortable among all children . 
Her right hand dropped neglectfully onto the armrest of the armchair ; With a start , Harry saw it wearing Marvolo's black gold ring , which killed his father . " Sir , is Professor Merrythought really retired ? " He asked . " Tom , Tom , if you know I can not tell you , " Slughorn said , waving a finger full of paths to Riddle's rebuke , though it had crushed the meaning with a wink . . " I have to say , I really want to know where you got this information from , son , it's true that I have more than half of the teachers here . " Riddle laughed ; The other kids laughed and looked at him admiringly . " What has created my strange ability to know things you do not know , and how to care carefully for your children - thank you for the pineapple , by the way , you are my favorite , my favorite fruit ... " When some children giggled , something very strange happened . 
The room was suddenly covered with dense fog , so that Harry could not see anything beyond Dumbledore's face , which was standing beside him . 
Then Slughorn's voice echoed in the mist , unnaturally , " You will 
Make mistakes , remember my words . " The mist immediately dissipated as it appeared and no one was referring to it , or at least something about an abnormality that had occurred . 
Very confused , Harry looked around as the small gold watch on Slughorn's desk at 11 o ' clock . " Oh , it's time to come ? " Slughorn said . " You should go , otherwise we ' ll have trouble . 
Lestrange , I want you to give me an essay tomorrow or else be forbidden . 
So was Avery . " Slughorn stood up from the armchair and placed the empty mug on the table as the children left the room . 
Voldemort , though , stayed in it . 
Harry could say that it was intentional , wanting to be the last in the room with Slughorn . " It looks very tough Tom , " Slughorn said , turning around and seeing that it was still in the room . " I do not want to be found out of bed now , and I'm a leader ... " " I want to ask you something , sir . " " Just ask , my son , just ask . "" Sir , what do you want to ask me about ... about the Horcruxes ? " And that came out again : the thick mist that covered the room made Harry unable to see Slughorn and Voldemort at all . both ; Only Dumbledore , laughing silently beside him . 
Then Slughorn's voice echoed , like he did once . " I do not know anything about Horcruxes and I will not tell you if I know ! 
Now get out of here and do not let me see you talk about this again ! "" That's all , " Dumbledore said quietly beside Harry . " It's time to leave . " And Harry's feet left the floor and fell again , a few seconds later , down the rug in front of Dumbledore's desk . " Is that all ? " Said Harry blankly . 
Dumbledore said that this is the most important memory , yet it does not see any meaning from it . 
To admit that the fog , and the fact that no one was paying attention to this , was really strange , but there was nothing else except that Voldemort had asked a question and had not answered . " If you could notice , " Dumbledore said , sitting behind his desk , " that the memory has been altered . " " Modified ? " Harry repeated , also sitting down . " Sure , " said Dumbledore . " Professor Slughorn handled his own memories . " " But why did he do that ? " " Because , in my opinion , he was ashamed of what he remembered , " said Dumbledore . . " He tried to redo his memory to show a better light , to remove the parts he did not want to see , this , as you see , was very sketchy , and All of these are good memories , apparently only seeing that real memory is still hidden behind those changes . " And so , for the first time , I gave my homework to Harry . 
You will have to persuade Professor Slughorn to reveal a real , undeniable memory that will be the most essential piece of information we need to know . " Harry stared at him . " But be sure , my lord , " he said , keeping his voice respectful enough , " I do not need you - you can use Legilimency ... " or Veritaserum ... "" Professor Slughorn is a witch that has the power to deal with those two spells , " Dumbledore said . " He accomplished much better Occlumency than he did . 
Morfin Gaunt , and I would be surprised if he had not been able to withhold the Veritaserum inside himself since I forced him to show me the memento . " No , I think it's crazy if we try to pull the truth out of Professor Slughorn with violence , and from there can do more harm than good , we do not expect him to leave Hogwarts . 
Even so , he has the same weaknesses as other people , and I believe that he is the one who can penetrate his shield . The most important thing is to get the real memory , Harry ... 
How important , we only know when we see the nature of truth . 
So , good luck ... and good night . " A little hesitated because of the unbearable disbandment , Harry walked very fast , " Good night , ma ' am . " When he closed the classroom door behind him , he heard Phineas Nigellus say , " I do not understand why this kid can do better than you , Dumbledore . "" And I do not expect you to do better , Phineas , " Dumbledore replied , and Fawkes moaned with a soft voice , resounding . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 18 Surprise Birthday 
The next day Harry had told both Ron and Hermione about the assignment Dumbledore had handed over to him , though still separate because Hermione was still refusing to be present with Ron for a long enough time to let him . it's a look of contempt . 
Ron thought Harry had no problem with Slughorn . He liked you , he said at breakfast , waving in the air an egg - fried dish . Did not refuse anything right ? 
Was not he his Imperial Prince ? 
Just stay in the last class today and ask him . Hermione , though , had a gloomy look . He must try to hide what really happened if Dumbledore could not get it from him , she said in a low voice , as they stood in the backyard , empty of snow during the break . Rest . Horcruxes Horcruxes I've never heard this You have not heard ? Harry was very disappointed ; It was hoped that Hermione was able to give it a clue as to what Horcruxes was . That might be a high - level magic , if not why would Voldemort want to know about them ? 
I think it is very difficult to get this information , Harry , you will have to be very careful about how to get to Slughorn , think of a way Ron thinks I can stay in the end of drug poisoning . Oh , well , if Won - Won thought so , then you should do so , she said , burning with anger . After all , when can Won - Won's ratings be wrong ? Hermione , you can not fail ! she said irritably , and ran away , leaving Harry with snow to ankle . 
The poisonous classes were lacking in nature these days , witnessing Harry , Ron and Hermione sitting at the same table . 
Today , Hermione transferred her cauldron to the other side of the table to sit near Ernie , ignoring Harry and Ron . What did you do ? Ron whispered to Harry , looking at Hermione's haughty face . 
But before Harry could answer , Slughorn demanded order from the classroom of the classroom . Any order , any order ! 
Hurry up , a lot of things to do in the afternoon ! Golpalott's Third Law Who Can Tell Us ? 
But Miss Granger can , so much ! Hermione recounts at the highest rate : " The Third - Law - of - Golpalott - Act - of - the - Mixed - To - Combat - will - be - stronger - than - sum - of - each - component - of - toxic - solution Exactly ! Slughorn laughed . Ten Points for Gryffindor ! 
Now , if we accept Golpalott's Third Law is right Harry has to admit Slughorn's words that Golpalott's Third Law is right , since it does not understand at all about it . 
And no one but Hermione seemed to understand what Slughorn said . 
That means , of course , that we have obtained the exact poison ingredient from Scarpin's Revelaspell , our main task is not a simple combination of selected antidotes for That part in a mixture , which is to find out what components are added , will be , almost like an alchemy process , transforming these individual elements . Ron is sitting next to Harry with his mouth open . , vaguely annotated in his new book , Advanced Medicine . 
Ron had forgotten that it was no longer possible thanks to Hermione's help to get rid of the clutter when it could not grasp what was going on here . 
And so , Slughorn finished . I want each of you to pick up a jar on my table . 
You will have to make an antidote for the toxins in it before the lesson ends . 
Good luck , and do not forget protective gloves ! Hermione had left the chair and halfway to Slughorn's desk as the rest of the class realized it was time to work , and by the time Harry , Ron , and Ernie came back to the desk , pour the contents of her jar into the cauldron and pinch a flame under it . It's a shame that the Prince can not help you with this Harry , she said brightly as she straightened up . You have to understand nature this time . 
There is no shortcut or cheat ! Very uncomfortable , Harry opened the vial of poison that it had taken from Slughorn's table , this was a colorful pink , poured into its cauldron and burned a flame at the bottom . 
It does not have a flimsy impression of what to do next . 
He glances at Ron , who is standing there looking absurd , imitating what Harry has done . Are you sure the Prince does not have any suggestions ? Ron whispered to Harry . 
Harry pulls out his trustworthy high - end drug book and goes to the chapter on Drugs . 
There is Golpalott's Third Law there , exactly what Hermione has just mentioned , but there is not a royal note explaining its meaning . 
Apparently , the Prince , like Hermione , had no difficulty understanding this law . Nothing , Harry said sadly . 
Hermione was waving her magic wand on the cauldron . 
Unfortunately , they could not imitate the spells she had used because she was so good at mesmerizing that she did not need a word at all . 
Ernie Macmillan , though , was whispering , ' Specialis Revelio ! " On his cauldron , which sounded very impressive , so Harry and Ron quickly followed suit . 
Harry took only five minutes to realize that the best celebrity - maker in the class had collapsed around it . 
Slughorn looked very hopefully at his cauldron when he first walked around the room , preparing for the radiant look he used to do , but eventually he quickly drove back , coughing as the smell of rotten eggs . made him uncomfortable . 
Hermione's expression had never been more satisfying ; She was annoyed at being over - reacted in every class . 
Now she is decomposing the ingredients that are separated from her poison into ten tiny glass jars . 
In order not to see this nasty scene over all other reasons , Harry bent over to the book of Prince Tu Lai and flipped through some pages unnecessarily . 
And there scrawled a long list of detoxifying substances . 
Just push a small goat gut into their throat . 
Harry stared at the words for a moment . 
Did it hear , for a long time , something about the goat guts ? 
Did Snape remind them of the first drug lesson ? ' A small stone is taken from a goat's gut , which can be protected from most of the poison . That was not the answer to Golpalott's question , and since Snape was their teacher , Harry did not dare to do this , but it was a matter of despair now . 
He quickly walked toward the cupboard and rummaged in there , pushing aside the horn with the code and the curious , dried herbs until it was found , in the same box the goat's stone . 
He opened the box as soon as Slughorn called , In two minutes , you ! There are half a dozen wrinkles in brown , like dried kidneys are real stones . 
Harry took one , put the box back in the closet and hurried back to his cauldron . Time is running out ! Said Slughorn comfortably . Come on , let's see how we did it ! 
What's up with Blaise ? Slowly , Slughorn moves around the room , examining the various detoxifying agents . 
No one can complete the task , though Hermione is trying to add some substance to her vial when Slughorn arrives at her desk . 
Ron has completely abandoned , and is merely trying to avoid smelling bad odors from his cauldron . 
Harry was standing there , the stone held firmly in a sweaty , sweaty hand . 
Mr. Slughorn went to their table in the end . 
He sniffed Ernie's drug and switched to Ron with a disgust . 
He did not linger at Ron's cauldron but immediately backed off , a little bit of nausea . And you , Harry , he said . 
What do you have for me ? Harry held out his hand , the goat gut in the middle of his palm . 
Slughorn looked at it for ten seconds . 
Harry hesitated at the moment whether he would scold him or not . 
Then he raised his head and chuckled . I'm very brave boy ! he laughed , took the stone and raised it so that the whole class could see . Oh , I'm just like my mother , I did not look at a goat gut stone that could definitely make an antidote for all these toxins ! Hermione , who was sweating and full of soot , looked very irritated . 
The girl's near - complete detoxification consists of fifty - two different ingredients , including a piece of her hair , boiling slowly beside Slughorn , who was only looking at Harry . And he thought to himself that goat was gooseberry ? she asked through grinding teeth . It is a spirit that a drug practitioner really should have ! Slughorn said cheerfully , before Harry could answer . Like his mother , she has an intuitive power to make drugs , not to deviate from what she has taken from Lily , Harry , yes , if you have a stone in your hand , Of course this can be applied even though they are not always effective , and also very rare , still considerable to know how to make an antidote . The only person in the room is more angry than Hermione is Malfoy , Harry , who was happy to see , scraped something that looked like cat feces from head to toe . 
Even so , before one of them could break up because Harry had risen to the top of the class without doing anything , the bell rang . It's time to clear your belongings ! Says Slughorn . And another ten points for Gryffindor for making us laugh ! Still giggling , he swayed toward the table in front of the basement . 
Harry lingered behind , spending an excessive amount of time packing his belongings . 
Both Ron and Hermione did not wish it luck when they left , both of which looked very uncomfortable . 
In the end , Harry and Slughorn were the only two in the room . Hurry up , Harry , I ' ll be late for class , Slughorn said hugs , put a gold hook to close his leather case . Sir , Harry said , remembering Voldemort irresistibly , I wanted to ask you something . Just ask , son , keep asking , Sir , I do not know what you know about the Horcruxes ? Slughorn sat asleep . 
His round face seemed to be engulfing itself . 
He licked his lips and said in a hoarse voice , What did you just say ? I ask if you know anything about the Horcruxes , mister . 
You know , Dumbledore told me to do this , Slughorn whispered . 
His voice changed completely . 
It is no longer kind anymore , but now it has become stunned and scared . 
He fumbled in his chest pocket and pulled out a towel , wiping his sweat from his eyebrows . Dumbledore gave the child that memory , Slughorn said . Eh . Right ? That's right , Harry said , deciding to this extent is best not to lie again . Well , of course , Slughorn said quietly , still patted his white face . Of course , if you had seen that memory , Harry , then you must know that I did not know anything at all , and he repeated loudly about the Horcruxes . He grabbed a pair of dragons , tucked the handkerchief into his pocket and headed for the door to the basement . Sir , Harry said earnestly , I just thought maybe a little more of that memory . Says Slughorn . Then I'm wrong , right ? WRONG ! He shouted the last words and , before Harry could say a word , slammed the door behind him . 
Neither Ron nor Hermione showed any sympathy when Harry told them about the terrible inquiry . 
Hermione is still upset by the way Harry walks to the top of the class without having to do anything . 
Ron was angry that Harry had not thrown a goat like that . It looks silly if both of you have the same thing ! Harry said uncomfortably . Listen , I have to try and calm him down so I can ask him about Voldemort , right ? 
Oh , you understand me ! It added in exasperation , as Ron frowned at the name . 
Very upset about her failure and Ron and Hermione's attitude , Harry contemplated the next few days about what to do next for Slughorn . 
It was decided that , at that moment , it would allow Slughorn to think that he had forgotten about the Horcruxes ; The best thing to do now is to lull him into a false sense of self - protection before returning to attacking . 
When Harry no longer asks Slughorn , the pharmacist turns back to normal treatment , and seems to have left the problem . 
Harry had been waiting for an invitation to his small party , and this time he would accept it , even if it had to leave the Quidditch day . 
Unfortunately , there was no invitation at all . 
Harry asked Hermione and Ginny : neither of them received invitations , and even , as they were known , others . 
Harry could not help but wonder if this meant that Slughorn had not completely forgotten what he was showing , simply not giving Harry another chance to ask him . 
In the meantime , the Hogwarts library did not satisfy Hermione for the first time in her life . 
She was surprised , she even forgot that she was very upset with Harry for his goat gut tips . I did not find the smallest sign of the Horcruxes ! she told him . 
Not one ! 
I checked in the restricted area and even in the worst books in which they told me how to make the most horrific of poisonous drugs - nothing ! 
All that I find is this , in the introduction to the most horrific of Mormon - heard this - about Horcrux , the most dangerous of the magical creations , we should not talk about it or guide . Who does it ? I mean , why mention it ? The girl said lack of calm , close the old book ; he cried out in pain . Oh , shut up , she yelled , stuffing it into her bag . 
Snow is melting around the school in February , to be replaced by a cold , gloomy wetness . 
The gray clouds , violet hearts , drifting down the mansion just above the castle , and the constant freezing rain made the lawn slippery and muddy . The destination of these was the first of six - year - old Turkish lessons , organized on Saturday morning so no one missed a session , in the Great Hall instead of in the yard . 
When Harry and Hermione went to the Great Hall ( Ron was with Lavender ) they found that the tables had disappeared . 
The rain was pouring in the tall windows above , and the enchanted ceiling was turning dark on top of them as they lined up in front of Professor McGonagall , Snape , Flitwick , and Sprout of the House - and a little witch that Harry could have guessed it was a Turkic Guide from the Ministry . 
He was so pale , with thin eyes , thin hair , and an unrealistic breath , it seemed as if a breeze could carry him away . 
Harry wondered if it would be a good idea to turn around and reduce his body weight , or that this slim body was great for someone who wanted to get away quickly . Good morning , the Ministry's sorcerer said , when all the students came and the House masters ordered the order . My name is Wilkie Twycross and I will be the Ministry's Helper Guide for you in the next twelve weeks . 
I hope to be able to prepare you for the upcoming Malfoy , the order to go and focus on ! Professor McGonagall shouted . 
People look around . 
Malfoy was blushed all the way ; He looked so angry when he stepped out of Crabbe's place , it seemed like they had a whispered quarrel . 
Harry looked quickly at Snape , who looked annoyed at the moment , though Harry was very suspicious that the cause for this was McGonagall's rebuke to a student in his house rather than Malfoy's rudeness . 
At that time , many of you were ready for the test , Twycross continued , as if there were no interruptions . 
And as you know , it's often impossible to shade Turkey and go inside Hogwarts . 
The master of the spell cast this spell , only in this Great Hall , within an hour , so that the children can practice . 
We must warn you that you can not paddle through the walls of the Great Hall , and that you are unwise to try . I want each of you to find a place for yourself , so that you have about five feet in front of you . There is a scene that squeezes and shoved when people split up , hit each other , and shouted the others out of their seats . 
Homeowners move between students , place them in position and prevent the quarrels . Harry , where are you going ? Asked Hermione . 
But Harry did not answer , he was moving swiftly in the crowd , through the position where Sanford Flitwick was trying to scream to position the Revenclaw boys , whom they all wanted in the side . First , through Professor Sprout , who was chasing the Hufflepuffs into their line , until , through Ernie Macmillan , it had gained a place behind the crowd , behind Malfoy , It is now taking advantage of the mob's move to continue fighting with Crabbe , five feet away and looking very rebellious . I do not know how long it will be , okay ? Malfoy shouted , obviously not knowing Harry was standing behind him . It's been longer than I thought . Crabbe opened his mouth , but Malfoy figured out what he meant . 
Look , it's not your job to mess with me , Crabbe , you and Goyle just do as I say and try to be careful ! I ' ll tell you what I'm doing if I want them to watch over me , Harry said , just loud enough for Malfoy to hear . 
Malfoy turned around , his hand raised with a wand , but at that moment the House Chiefs shouted , Order ! and the silence was overwhelming . 
Malfoy slowly turned to the front . Thanks , Twycross said . Now he waved his wand . 
The old wooden rings appeared on the floor in front of each student . The important thing to remember when paddling is three D ! , Twycross says . Destination , Clear , and Careful ! Step one : Focus your thoughts on your chosen destination , Twycross says . In this case , it is inside the ring of the children . 
Focus on the destination right away . People glance around to see if other people look at their circle or not , and then quickly do as they were told . 
Harry stared at the circular portion on the dusty floor surrounded by his ring and tried not to think of anything else . 
But it seemed impossible , as it did not do any way to think of nothing that Malfoy remake need to watch . The second step , Twycross says , concentrates its whole determination to occupy the space the children can see ! 
Let the will of the children overflow from consciousness to every factor in the body ! Harry looked sneakily around . 
A little distance to the left of it , Ernie Macmillan was concentrating on its ring so intense that its face was pale ; This looks like it is stretching to lay a large egg in the quafle . 
Harry squeezed a small smile and quickly returned to his ring . The third step , Twycross says , and only when I signal the focus to the destination , I feel myself float through the air , moving with thought . 
Listen to my command , one , two 
Harry looked around again ; A lot of people are really scared of being called too fast . 
Harry tried to concentrate his thoughts on the ring ; He forgot what the three D are . FATHER ! Harry somersaulted , unbalanced and almost fell . 
It's not the only one . 
The Great Hall suddenly filled all the people are stunned ; Neville fell back on the ground ; Ernie Macmillan , on the other hand , did a circling dance into her ring and looked scared at the time , until he saw Dean Thomas laughing at it . Do not worry , do not worry , Twycross says coldly , it seems he does not expect a better thing to happen . 
Reconstruct your rings , and return to the original position . Second is no better than the first . 
The third time is just as bad . 
Until the fourth time an interesting thing happened . 
There was a shriek of pain and people looked around , scared , seeing Susan Bones of the Hufflepuff shudder in her lap with her left leg still five feet away , where she caught first . 
Homeowners came to her ; There was a loud explosion and a purple smoke , and when it was gone , it was revealed that Susan was sobbing , her legs tied , but still very scared . Separation , or divisions of the body , Wilkie Twycross speaks calmly , occurs when the spirit is not sufficiently defined . 
You have to keep focused on the destination , and move , not fast , just be careful , so Twycross steps in , turns back to the direction of the destination with his arms wide open and disappears in a circle . gown , and reappear in the back of the Great Hall . Remember the three D , he said , and try again one - two - three But in an hour later , Susan's Separation is still the most interesting thing to happen . 
Twycross is not depressed . 
Tucked the robe over his neck , he just said , Next Saturday continues , everyone , and do not forget : Attach , Clear , and Careful . With that , he waved his wand , the rings disappeared , and he left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall . 
Arguments immediately burst forth as people prepared to go outside . Are you doing well ? Asked Ron , running toward Harry . I think I dropped something last time . - slightly itchy in my legs . I suppose the trainers are too small for you , Won - Won , a voice behind him , and Hermione passing by , smirking . I did not see anything , Harry said , despite the interruption . But now I do not care about it anymore . What do you mean , you do not care , you do not want to learn Turkish ? Ron doubted . I'm not very happy , really . 
I like to fly , said Harry , turning over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was , and hurry as they came to the Outer Room . Listen , hurry up , there's one thing I like Very confused , Ron runs after Harry to Gryffindor Tower . 
They were hindered by the Peeves , who were closing the door on the fourth floor and refusing to let students through until they had to burn their own trousers , but Harry and Ron merely turned to him . Their credible shortcuts . 
Within five minutes , they climbed into the portrait hole . Are you going to tell me what you're doing ? Asked Ron , panting . Up here , Harry said , and as he crossed the common room and led the way to the door on the stairs of the boys . 
The bedroom , as Harry hoped , was completely deserted . 
He opened his chest and started rummaging in it , Ron was looking at his lack of composure . Harry Malfoy is using Crabbe and Goyle as watchmen . 
He had argued with Crabbe at the time . 
I want to know aha . It found , a piece of white paper folded , that it was straightening out and hit it with a wand . I swear I did not do anything good or Malfoy . Immediately , the map of the hackers appeared on the skin of the goat . It is a detailed map of everyone in the mansion's floors and , moving around it , is a black mark labeled only by the people in the castle . Help me find Malfoy , Harry said hurriedly . 
She spread the paper to bed and she and Ron crawled up there , searching . Over there ! Said Ron , after a minute , that range . He was in Slytherin's common room , watching this with Parkinson and Zabini , and Crabbe and Goyle Harry looked at the map , disappointed , but returned immediately . Okay , from now on I ' ll keep an eye on it , it's sure . And by the time I saw him sneaking around with Crabbe and Goyle watching out , I would wear an invisibility cloak and go see it . It got up when Neville came into the room , bringing with him a smell of a slightly burning object , and began to rummage in his coffin for clean pants . 
Despite his determination to learn Malfoy , Harry was not fortunate enough for a few weeks . 
Although it looks at the map as much as possible , occasionally entering the restroom unnecessarily between classes to test , it still does not see Malfoy in any questionable place once . 
It must be admitted that he had seen Crabbe and Goyle move around the castle by himself more than usual , occasionally standing still in the solitary corridors , but at that moment Malfoy was no longer around them . , which can not even be found anywhere else on the map . This is the most weird . 
Harry struggled with the assumption that Malfoy had actually left school , but could not predict how it would work , for a very strict protection was imposed on the school at this time . 
It can only be assumed that it has misled Malfoy in the midst of hundreds of tiny black spots on the map . 
And with the fact that Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle appear on different paths while they are not always apart , these things happen when people grow up - Ron and Hermione , Harry associates a Deprivation , is a living proof . 
February to March without any change of weather apart from being more windy and wetter . 
With the same indignation , a sign was erected on all the living room bulletin boards that the forthcoming trip to Hogsmeade had been canceled . 
Ron was angry . That day is my birthday ! he said , I was looking forward to that day ! Not a big surprise right ? Said Harry . See what happened to Katie . She has not returned from St . Mungo Hospital . 
And more , the disappearances have been posted in the Prophet's Daily , including some of the Hogwarts family of relatives . But now all I can hope for is a stupid Turkey test ! Ron grumbled . A great birthday present The next three lessons , turtleneck is still the same , although some have tried to be separated . 
The anger was high and there was a feeling of ill - will for Wilkie Twycross and his three D's , which inspired a series of aliases for him , the two most polite ones being ' Dogs ' and ' Dogs ' . Happy Birthday Ron , Harry said as they woke up on the first day of March because Seamus and Dean had left loudly for breakfast . There are gifts . He tossed the gift package to Ron's bed , to join with a small pile that , Harry thought , was brought by the elves at night . Congratulations , Ron was sluggish , and as he tear the wrapper , Harry got out of bed , opened his coffin , and searched for the map of the hijackers , where it was hidden after each use . 
He pulled out half of the coffin before it found the map hidden beneath the carefully - stuffed socks , where it hid the lucky bottle , Felix Felicis . That's right , he whispered , taking the map to bed with it , pounding quietly and whispering , I swear I did not do anything good , letting Neville , going through the foot of his bed , do not hear . Beautiful Harry ! Said Ron , waving at the new Thumer Gloves Harry had given him . Nothing , Harry said not concentrating , because he was searching in the Slytherin bedroom for Malfoy there . I do not think it's in his bed , Ron does not reply ; He is too busy with opening gifts , sometimes uttering a satisfied expression . this year is a big batch ! he announced , holding up a heavy gold watch with ancient signs around the edges and small stars moving in place of the needles . Have you seen my parents for me ? 
God , I think next year I will want to go to adulthood again . Great , Harry exclaimed , giving the watch a glance and then staring more into the map . 
Where's Malfoy ? 
It did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall , eating breakfast was not near Snape , who was sitting in his study room , not in any bathroom or clinic . Try one . are not ? Said Ron , holding up a box of Chocolate Vac . No thanks , Harry said , looking up . Malfoy turned again ! Can not stop , Ron said , throwing a second Vac inside his mouth as he took off his nightgown . Come on , if you do not want to go to Turkey with an empty stomach that can make it easier , I think Ron looks hesitantly at the chocolate box , shrugging his shoulders and getting his third . . 
Harry hit the map with his wand , whispering , The demon was finished , though it was not complete , and dressed in , thought very tense . 
There must be an explanation for the frequent disappearance of Malfoy , but it simply can not figure out what that is . 
The best way to find out is to follow it , but even this invisibility cloak does not work at all ; It also has lessons , Quidditch lessons , homework and paddling ; He could not follow Malfoy around the school all day without being judged on hard work . Finished yet ? it said to Ron . 
It was halfway to the bedroom door when he realized that Ron was still standing there , leaning against the bed pillar , looking out the window with a strange rainbow on his face . Ron ? Breakfast . I'm not hungry . Harry stared at him . I think you just said ? Oh , okay , I ' ll come down with you , Ron sighs , but I do not want to eat . 
Harry looked at it suspiciously . Have you just eat half a chocolate box ? Not that , Ron sighed . You do not understand . Okay , Harry said , though confused as he turned to open the door . Harry ! Said Ron suddenly . What ? Harry , I can not stand it ! Can not you bear it ? Asked Harry , now began to really feel scared . 
Ron looked pale and looked like he was sick . I can not stop thinking about him ! Said Ron hoarsely . 
Harry watched him gasp . 
He did not expect this and was not sure if he wanted to hear it . 
Friends are welcome , but if Ron starts calling Lavender ' Lav Lav ' , he must hold his position . Why does this make you not eat breakfast ? Asked Harry , trying to put a normal thing into the problem . I do not think he treats me well , Ron said desperately . He knew he existed , Harry said bewildered . Does he still have a partner with you ? Ron blinked . Who are you talking about ? Who are you talking about ? Harry said , with a growing sense that all reason had fallen out of the story . 
Romilda Vane , Ron whispered , and his face seemed to glow as it spoke , as if it had been shone by the purest sunshine . 
They looked at each other for a minute , then Harry said , is that a joke ? 
You're kidding . I think Harry , I think I fell in love with him , Ron said in a choked voice . All right , Harry said , walking toward Ron to have a better look at his dull eyes and pale skin , and then say that again and raise his face . I love him , Ron said almost impossible to breathe . Have you seen his hair yet , it's very black and shiny and silky and his eyes ? his big black eyes ? 
And this is funny , Harry says lack of calm , but the joke is over ? 
Forget it ! He turned away ; He walked two steps towards the door when a strong blow struck his right ear . 
Stunned , it turned around . 
Ron's fist was retracted , his face distorted by anger ; It is preparing to attack again . 
Harry reacts instinctively ; The wand was pulled out of his pocket and a mantra appeared in his head without thinking : Leicorpus ! 
Ron yelled as his heel was twisted forward ; It writhes helplessly , upside down its tail , its cloak hanging with it . 
What is it for ? Harry screamed . You insulted him , Harry ! 
You said it was a joke ! Ron screamed , his face gradually turning purple as the blood rushed to his head . that's crazy ! Said Harry . What did you do ? Then he saw the box lying on Ron's bed and the truth came to his head with the pressure of a huge human line . Where did you get this chocolate box ? That's my birthday present ! Shouted Ron , circling slowly in the air as he struggled to escape . I've invited you one ? Did you just pick it up from the floor ? 
It fell on my bed , okay ? 
Let's go ! That does not fall on your bed , idiot , you do not understand ? 
It's for me , I pulled it out of my coffin when I searched for the map . It's the chocolate Rosa that Romilda gave me before Christmas and it's filled with Diabetes ! But only one word that seems to enter Ron's head . Romilda ? it repeats . Did you say Romilda ? 
Harry - do you know him ? 
Can you introduce me ? Harry stared at Ron swaying up , his face looking incredibly hopeful , and trying to hold back his laughter . 
Part of it - the closest part to the stingy ear - is very interested in the idea of ​​ dropping Ron out and watching it run like crazy until the drug is over but on the other hand , they're friends , Ron did not It's been since it was attacked , and Harry thinks it deserves another blow if it accepts Ron's declaration of immortal love for Romilda Vane . Oh , I ' ll introduce you , Harry said , thinking very fast . I ' ll let you down , okay ? He dropped Ron on the floor ( his ear was quite painful ) , but Ron merely stood with his legs , laughing aloud . He would be in Slughorn's office , Harry said confidently , leading the way to the door . Why is he in there ? Asked Ron , anxious to catch up . Oh , he's got his doctor's poison lessons with him , Harry said , messing up . May I ask if I can study with him ? Asked Ron enthusiastically . Great idea , Harry said . 
Lavender was waiting outside the portrait hole , a problem Harry had not anticipated . 
You're late Won - Won ! she frowned . I have something to wear , Ron says lack of calm , Harry is about to introduce me to Romilda Vane . And without saying a word to her , he pushed himself out of the portrait hole . 
Harry tried to make an apologetic expression to Lavender , but it looked like it was more funny , because she seemed more offended than ever when Mrs. Beo closed behind them . 
Harry was a little worried that Slughorn had gone for breakfast , but he opened the door at the first knock , wearing a blue velvet cloak and a matching hat that looked like it was a little sloppy . Harry , he muttered . Too early to call you I often get up late on a Saturday morning Dear professor , I'm so sorry to trouble you , Harry said as low as possible , while Ron was standing on his toes , trying To see Slughorn in his room , but Ron's friend has unfortunately swallowed a dose of Pharmacy . 
Can not you make him a remedy ? Let me take him down to Mrs. Pomfrey , but we're not allowed to have anything from the Weasley Wizard Wheezes and you know the awkward questions I thought you could make a dose of it . And then Harry , a master - maker like you ? Asked Slughorn . Oh , Harry said , slightly distracted by the fact that Ron was now poking his ribs with his elbow to push her into the room , but , I had never made a cure for the drug , Master , and by the time I finished , Ron was able to do something horrible . It was very helpful , Ron picked the right time to exclaim , I did not see him . 
Harry - Is he hiding him ? Is this medicine made in the day ? Asked Slughorn , who was looking at Ron for a moment 
professional pleasure . They can increase the strength , you know , the stronger if the longer it holds . This proves so many things , Harry gasped , was actually struggling with Ron to keep him from slamming Slughorn out the door . Today is his birthday , Professor , it's imploring . Okay , come in , come on , Slughorn calm down . I have some necessities here in my pocket , it's not a hard thing to make Ron rush through the door to enter Slughorn's overheated and cramped office , Its balance with Harry's grip on his neck and whispered , Does not he see that ? He's not here yet , Harry said , watching Slughorn open his cigarette pack and add a few small pinches to the other in a small glass jar . That's good , Ron says enthusiastically . How about me ? Very handsome , Slughorn said gently , giving Ron a glass of clear liquid . Now drink this , this is the brain power , help calm when she came here , you know . Really , Ron said eagerly , and he drank the poison . 
Harry and Slughorn look at it . 
A moment later , Ron smiled at them . 
Then , very slowly , his smile sank and disappeared , to be replaced by a sense of extreme fear . Back to normal , right ? Said Harry , laughing . 
Slughorn smiled quietly . Thank you very much , Professor . Do not mind boys , do not mind , Slughorn said , as Ron collapsed into the nearby armchair , looking very ugly . Lift - me - up , that's what it needs , Slughorn continued , hurrying toward the table filled with drinks . We have Butter Beer , we have wine , we have the last bottle of mature oak honey that hmm should have given this to Dumbledore in Christmas thôi he shrugged it can not miss something that has never to taste ! 
Why not open the bottle now and celebrate Mr. Weasley's birthday ? 
Nothing but a pure soul can overcome the pain of a broken love . He laughs again and Harry joins . This is the first time he has found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his first pathetic attempt to retrieve his memory . 
Possibly , if it tries to keep Slughorn in a good mood maybe if they are drinking enough oatmeal to me then , Slughorn says , giving Harry and Ron each a glass of wine , before picking up his own cup . Come on , a very happy birthday , Ralph - Ron - Harry whispered . 
But Ron , who did not seem to have listened to the acclamation , poured alcohol into his mouth and swallowed . 
There was a second , perhaps no longer than a little heartbeat , which Harry knew was something really bad that Slughorn did not seem to notice . 
and wish you more Ron ! Ron dropped his glass of wine ; It was halfway up and down , its limbs were jerking uncontrollably . 
The foam exits from his mouth and his eyes widen from his eye socket . Professor ! Harry screamed . Do something ! But Slughorn seemed to be stiff in shock . 
Ron twitched and choked : his skin turned blue . But Slughorn faltered . 
Harry ran through the low table and reached Slughorn's open medicine chest , pulling out the vials and bags , while the terrible sound of Ron's or Ron's breathing resounded through the room . 
Then he found it - a dry - wrinkled kidney stone that Slughorn had taken from his hands during a drug school session . 
He ran to Ron's side , opened his jaw , and stuffed the goat's goat into his mouth . 
Ron shivered very hard , then gasped and his body softened , lying still .

Chapter 19 The Elves 
After all , this is not Ron's happy birthday right ? Fred said . 
It was dark , the room was very quiet , the window was covered with curtains , the lights were lit up . 
Ron's bed is the only one lying . 
Harry , Hermione , and Ginny were sitting around it ; They spent the whole day waiting outside the double doors , trying to look inside every time someone came in . 
Mrs. Pomfrey showed them at 8 o ' clock . 
Fred and George arrived at ten o ' clock . We never imagined that we would have to give you presents in this situation , George laughed , putting down a big bag of presents on Ron's bedside table and sitting next to Ginny . Oh , when we see , it's still awake , Fred said . There when we were at Hogsmeade , waiting to make it suddenly George said . Have you been to Hogsmeade ? Ginny looked up . You guys are thinking of buying Zonko , Fred says . A branch at Hogsmeade , you know , but not much if you do not go out shopping for the weekend . Forget about that . It turns out a chair beside Harry and looks at Ron's pale gray face . How exactly did it happen , Harry ? Harry tells the story that he had to recount , almost a hundred times , to Dumbledore , Miss McGonagall , Mrs. Pomfrey , Hermione , and to Ginny . Then I put the ice cubes in his throat and it seemed a little easier breathing , Mr. Slughorn came to help , Miss McGonagall and Mrs. Pomfrey turned around and they brought Ron here . 
They think Ron will be good . 
Mrs. Pomfrey said she would have to stay here for about a week , and she would have to drink the perfume . Oh , good thing I figured out a goat's goat , George whispered . Luckily , there was a member in the room , Harry said , still cold - bitten by the thought of not knowing what would happen if he did not put his hand on the little stone . 
Hermione cried out in a low voice . 
She was unusually silent all day . She dashes quickly , white face , to Harry in the hospital room and demands to know what happened , she has not been involved in Harry and Ginny's obsessive discussion of How did Ron get poisoned , just sitting next to them , holding his mouth shut and scared , until they were allowed to visit . So do you know ? Fred asked Ginny . They visited him already , they just arrived 1 hour ago they are in Dumbledore's office right now , but they ' ll be back right away . There was a silent moment when the whole gang looked at Ron muttering in his sleep . myself . The poison in the water ? Fred said softly . 
Yes , Harry said at once ; He can not think of anything else and is happy to have the opportunity to be discussed again . Slughorn put it in . How could he put something in Ron's cup that I could not see ? Maybe , Harry said , but why did Slughorn want to poison Ron ? Fred , serious . Do not you think he dropped the wrong one ? 
Want to poison yourself ? Why did Mr. Slughorn want to poison Harry ? Asked Ginny . I do not know , Fred said , but there are so many people who want to poison Harry ? ' Chooser ' and everything ? And do you think Slughorn is the Death Eater ? Ginny said . Everything is possible , Fred slammed . He may be possessed of an authoritarian curse , George said . Or he's innocent , Ginny says . The poison may have been in the bottle , in case it was for Slughorn himself . Who wants to kill Slughorn ? Dumbledore thought that Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side , Harry said . Slughorn had been absent for a year before he arrived at Hogwarts . 
And he thought of the memory that Dumbledore could not get from Slughorn . And maybe Voldemort wanted him to go away from his eyes , maybe he thought he was worth it in Dumbledore's eyes . But he had said that Slughorn was planning for Dumbledore's Untie in Christmas , Ginny recalled it . So poisoners can easily target Dumbledore . If so , he must not know Slughorn , said Hermione , for the first time in several hours and sounded like she was suffering from a cold . But who knows that Slughorn knows that there is a very big possibility that he keeps himself so full of flavor . Oh , my knee , Ron exclaimed without warning in the midst of the kids . 
They all looked at him nervously , but after making the incomprehensible sound for a moment , it continued to snore . 
The door of the bedroom opened , causing them to jolt : Hagrid strode towards them , his hair was wet , his bearded skirt fluttering beside him , an arrow in his hand , he Again , a footprint of big feet with a small dolphin on the floor . Stay in the forest today ! he gasped . Aragog was getting worse and worse , I read to him that he had not woken up to dinner until now and then Professor Sprout told me about Ron ! 
How is it ? Not bad , Harry said . They said it would be good . There should not be more than 6 visitors at one time ! Mrs. Pomfrey said , hurrying out of her office . Hagrid added six , George pointed out . Oh yes , Mrs. Pomfrey said , seems to have counted Hagrid as some of his greatness . To cover up her confusion , she hurriedly wiped the mud on the floor with her wand . I can not believe it , Hagrid said hoarsely , shaking his head as he looked down at Ron . Can not believe it See it lying there Do you want to hurt it ? That's what we're talking about , Harry said . We do not know . I do not think anyone tries to quit a Quidditch team , Fred said frankly . Wood did with the Slytherins if he could escape . Hmm , I do not think it's Quidditch , but I think there's a connection between the attacks , Hermione said quietly . Why did you come to that conclusion ? Fred said . 
For one thing , they were all able to die and were saved , though it was only luck . 
And another thing , both the poison and the necklace did not seem to be the right place to be attacked . 
Of course , the little girl kept making things worse because they did not seem to care how many people they had to kill , as long as they really cleared up the victim . their . Before everyone could respond to this ominous remarks , the tin door opened and Mrs. Weasley ran into the bed . 
They can do nothing but tell themselves that Ron will recover completely on their last visit ; Now Mrs. Weasley grabbed Harry and hugged him tightly . Dumbledore told me how you saved it with stones , she sobbed . Oh , what else can we say ? 
You saved Ginny , you saved Arthur , now you save Ron too do not do not have Harry whispered awkwardly . Half of the family owes more lives , now we have to stop and think about it , Mr. Weasley said in a shy voice . I must say it was a good sign for the Weasley when Ron decided to sit in the cabin with him on the train to Hogwarts , Harry . Harry could not think of anything to say at this time , and it was almost overjoyed when Pomfrey reminded them that only six people were allowed to be around Ron's bed ; he and Hermione got up immediately , and Hagrid decided to go with them , leaving Ron with his family . Horrible , Hagrid grunted in his thick beard as the three walked back through the corridor to the marble stairs . There's a new security system , so the guys are still attacked . Dumbledore is very worried . He does not say much , but I can say he does not mind . Hagrid ? Hermione said earnestly . I think he has a lot of ideas , like his mind , Hagrid said . But he still did not know who sent the necklace or the poison into the glass , otherwise they would be arrested right ? It makes me nervous , Hagrid says , lowering his voice and looking around over his shoulder ( Harry , for the same reason , looks up at the ceiling to see if there are peeves there ) , how Hogwarts can work . So long as the kids are attacked like this . 
Is it like the Secret Room ? 
There will be a lot of disturbances , and more parents will drag their kids out of school , and next thing you know , the council of Hagrid executives will not say anymore when a ghost haunts in silence , then again whispering in hoarse voice , the operators will have to discuss closing the door to ensure safety . Surely not ? Said Hermione , looking worried . Have to look in their perspective , Hagrid said heavily . I mean , is it always a bit risky to send your children to Hogwarts ? 
Have you prepared yourself for the accident , with hundreds of underage witches locked in together , but that assassination is planned , that is completely different . 
So did not tell Dumbledore angry with Sn Hagrid for a sudden stop , a familiar guilty feeling that had appeared on his face , over his black beard . What ? Harry said quickly . 
Dumbledore angry with Snape ? I never said that , Hagrid said , although his bewildered face could not be more clear . Watch the clock . it was almost midnight . 
I have to Uncle Hagrid , why is Dumbledore angry with Snape ? Asked Harry loudly . Shhh ! Hagrid said , both angry and anxious . Do not scream like that , Harry , I do not want to lose my job . Do not care , I do not think you care , right now I have not studied Caregiver do not make me feel guilty anymore , no effect ! Said Harry firmly . What did Snape do ? I do not know Harry , I should not hear it anymore ! 
I'm going out of the forest one evening and I've heard them talking , fighting . 
Not wanting to be noticed , so I shun and try not to listen , but it is hilarious , a heated argument and it's hard to keep it off the ear . Why ? Harry urged him , as Hagrid pounded hard on his feet . We only hear Snape say that Dumbledore was so relying on him and maybe he - Snape - did not want to do it anymore . I do not know Harry , it looks like Snape feels overworked , just like that , Dumbledore told him very quickly that he accepted that and that's all . 
Very hard with him . 
And then he talked a lot about Snape doing investigations in his House , in Slytherin . 
Hmm , there's nothing weird about this ! Hagrid added in a rush , as Harry and Hermione gave each other a meaningful look . All Homeowners are required to participate in the necklace service . Yes , but Dumbledore does not blame the rest of them , does he ? Said Harry . Hearing this , Hagrid twisted uncomfortably his bow in his hand ; There was a big crack and it doubled . I know what you think of Snape , Harry , and I do not want you to learn more about this . Look , Hermione said shortly . 
They turned to just in time to see Argus Filch's shadow set on the wall behind them before he turned , his hips back , his jaw trembling . Oh shout ! he wheezed . Outside the bedroom too late , that is blocked ! No Filch , Hagrid said succinctly . Are they with me ? And what is the difference ? Filch said contemptuously . I am a strong teacher , is not it , Mr. Sneaky ! Said Hagrid , turning up immediately . 
There was a sigh of disgust when Filch was upset by anger ; Mrs. Noris arrived , was not seen , and was stepping around Filch's thin ankle . Go away , Hagrid said on the corner of his mouth . 
Harry did not wait to be reminded a second time ; he and Hermione are gone ; Hagrid and Filch's voice was still behind when they ran . 
They ran past the Peeves near the turn of the Gryffindor Tower ; But it is taking a happy turn to where the shouting , giggling and calling , When there is a quarrel and where there is a problem Calling Peeves , it will multiply twice . not willing to be awakened , but still rise up front to clamber them to climb into the common room of peace and emptiness . 
It seems that people still do not know about Ron ; Harry was very calm : He had been interrogated enough that day . 
Hermione wished it good sleep and entered the female bedroom . 
Harry , though , remained , sitting in a chair by the fireplace and looking down at the dying coal . 
So Dumbledore quarreled with Snape . 
Ignoring all the things he had said to Harry , despite all the insistence that he fully trusted Snape , he lost control of him . He did not think Snape was trying to find out in The Slytherins either , maybe , find out a Slytherin : 
Malfoy . 
It was because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything stupid , take trouble into his hands , so that he insisted that there was nothing in Harry's suspicion . 
Looks pretty right . 
It is even possible that Dumbledore did not want something that distracted Harry from their lessons , or from the job of taking Slughorn's memories . 
Maybe Dumbledore does not think it's fair to talk about doubts about a 16 - year - old's teacher . You're Potter ! Harry jumped in shock , the wand was ready . 
It was completely thought that the common room was empty ; It was not prepared for a heavy body to suddenly rise up in a chair far away . 
Clearly , it was Cormac McLaggen . I waited for you to come back , McLaggen said , not care about Harry's wand . I forgot to sleep . 
Listen , I see them bringing Weasley to the clinic before . 
Looks like it can not play in next week's match . It took a while for Harry to figure out what McLaggen was talking about . Yeah , Quidditch , he said , putting the wand in the waistband of his jeans and running his hand over his tired hair . Oh , maybe it's not playable . So , I ' ll play in the Cumon position , right ? Said McLaggen . Oh , Harry said . Well , I suppose so It can not think of an objection ; After all , McLaggen was , of course , the second best after the rehearsals . Great , McLaggen said in a satisfying voice . When ? What ? 
Well , there is a training session tomorrow night . Very good . 
Listen to this Potter , we have to talk a little bit earlier . 
I have some ideas for some methods that you may find useful . Yes , Harry says lack of vivaciousness . Hmm , I ' ll hear it tomorrow . 
I'm tired of seeing you again . The news of Ron's poisoning spread out very fast the next day , but this does not detract from the sense that the attack on Katie was over . 
Everyone seems to think it's just an accident , assuming it was in the master's room all day , and that it was given immediate cure so it was not harmful . 
Actually , the Gryffindors are largely interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff , as many want to see Zacharias Smith , the Hufflepuffs ' Undertaker , be punished for his narrative in the opening game . against Slytherin . 
Harry , however , is less interested in Quidditch ; It was quickly haunted by Draco Malfoy . 
Continuing to check the map of the hackers when the opportunity , sometimes it goes around to places where Malfoy appears , but it does not know what he does something unusual . 
And there are still times when I can not explain why Malfoy left the map . But Harry did not have much time to look at it , because Quidditch sessions , homework , and truth Now it was stuck everywhere by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown . 
It can not decide which one of them is more offensive . 
McLaggen constantly brings up a stream of hints that he might be a better head for the team than Ron , and that now that Harry has seen him play regularly , it's certainly a failure . think so ; He also loved to criticize the rest of the team and provided Harry with a detailed training program , so much so that once Harry had to remind him who the captain was . 
In the meantime , Lavender went to Harry to ask about Ron , which Harry felt almost fatigued over McLaggen's Quidditch lectures . First of all , Lavender was very troubled to say that no one had the idea of ​​ telling her that Ron was in the room - I mean , I was his girlfriend ! - but unfortunately , she decided to forgive Harry for forgetting about it and was eagerly discussing with Harry deeply in Ron's thoughts , an uncomfortable experience that Harry tried to avoid mentioning . Listen , why do not you talk to Ron about these things ? Harry asked , after a long special inquiry by Lavender about exactly what Ron said about her new robes to whether Harry thought Ron was serious about his relationship with Lavender . Oh , I ' ll come , but he ' ll be asleep every time I see him ! Lavender annoyed . So ? Harry suddenly , as he had seen Ron fully awake when he woke up in the ward , shared the same interest in Dumbledore's news and Snape's controversy , along with the denial of McLaggen . as much as possible . Does Hermione Granger still visit him ? Lavender asked suddenly . Oh , I think so , they are friends , right ? Harry is uncomfortable . My friend , do not make me laugh , Lavender said contemptuously . He did not talk to her long after she came with me ! 
But I suppose it wants to date him , and now he's completely interesting . Did you call it quit being interesting ? Asked Harry . Anyway , excuse me , I have to go here McLaggen is talking about Quidditch , Harry says hurriedly , and he spits the other way through a door that looks like a wall , and flies to the shortcut . Give it to the poison , thank God , both Lavender and McLaggen can not follow it . 
In the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff , Harry turned to the clinic before coming to the stadium . 
Ron is very agitated ; Mrs. Pomfrey did not let her down to watch the match , she thought it would make him very angry . How did McLaggen play ? She asked Harry anxiously , clearly forgot that he had asked this question twice . I said it , Harry said calmly , he is the world's most and I do not want to keep him doing anything . 
He kept telling us what to do , he thought he could play in every position better than all of us . 
I can not wait to give him a shot . 
And talking about giving someone a shot , Harry added , bending down to pick up the Firebolt broom , could he stop pretending to sleep when Lavender came ? 
It also made me crazy . Oh , Ron said , embarrassed . Oh , okay . If you do not want to go with him anymore , just say it , Harry said . Oh , that's not easy , is not it ? Said Ron . 
It stopped . Hermione was going to visit before the match ? it added by accident . No , he was down with Ginny . Oh , Ron said , looks sad . OK . 
Good luck . 
I hope you can beat McLag to me , Smith . I ' ll try , Harry put the broom on his shoulders . Meet him after the game . He quickly descended through the empty corridors ; The school is in the yard , either in the stadium or going there . 
He looked through the windows as he passed , trying to quantify how strong the wind was , a sound coming out of the front made him look up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him , along with the two girls . , both appear irritated and swollen . 
Malfoy stopped short as he saw Harry , then smiled a little humor and went on . Where are you going ? Harry asked . 
Oh , I'm really trying to tell you , because it's Potter's job , Malfoy hissed . You have to hurry up , they are waiting for the ' chosen captain ' - ' The Kid ' - whatever they call you . One of the girls giggled reluctantly . 
Harry stared at the little girl . 
She blushed . 
Malfoy continues to go through Harry and the girl and his companion follow , turning away and away from sight . 
Harry stood there and watched them disappear . true is true ; He tried his best to get to the game on time , but Malfoy slipped away when the whole school was not there : Harry's best chance to find out what Malfoy was doing . 
The silence passed , and Harry was still there , standing like a cloak , staring at where Malfoy was gone . Where are you ? Ginny asked as Harry leaped into the dressing room . 
The team has changed and is ready ; Coote and Peakes , the Creepers , are knocking the stick nervously on their feet . He met Malfoy , Harry whispered to her as she pulled the red gown over her head . So you want to know what it does on the castle with its two girlfriends when everyone else is here . Is that important now ? Hmm , did not you go find out ? Said Harry , grabbing the Firebolt tree and pulling the glass upright . go ! And without saying another word , he came out on the court in a cheeky voice . 
It was quiet today ; clouds are very sparse ; Occasionally there is a glare of the sun rising . conditions are easy to trick here ! McLaggen encouraged the team . Coote , Peakes , you will want to fly out of the sun , so they will not see you fly to me as the captain , McLaggen , stop the directing , Harry angry . Get out at the foot of the golf ball ! When McLaggen leaves , Harry turns to Coote and Peakes . 
Make sure you avoid the sunlight , it will tell you to reluctantly . 
It shook hands with Captain Hufflepuff , and then , in Hooch's whistle , popped up and flew in the air , higher than all the others , hovering around the yard to find the Snitch . 
If it catches the ball quickly and quickly , it also has the chance to return to the castle , get the Map of the Chieftain , and find out what Malfoy is doing . And it's Smith of Hufflepuff with Quaffle , a dream voice . All over the stadium . He explained the last time , of course , and Ginny Weasley was flying towards him , I think it was totally purposeful , it seems . 
Smith is very rude to Gryffindor , I suspect he is regretting having to play with them today . Well , look , you lost the Quaffle , Ginny got out of his hand , I liked him very well Harry looked down at the speaker's column . 
Certainly no one was able to let Luna interpret it . 
But even there , there was no mistake , a long blonde hair , or a buttercup necklace . Next to Luna , Professor McGonagall was uncomfortable , like She was thinking about giving her the job . 
But now a big Hufflepuff player has taken the ball from her , I can not remember his name , something like Bibble is not , Buggins is Cadwallader ! Professor McGonagall said loudly from beside her . the crowd laughed . 
Harry looked around for the Snitch ; There was no sign of it . 
Seconds later , Cadwallader scored . 
McLaggen is scolding Ginny for leaving the Quaffle out of her control , with the result that she can not even see the big red ball go through her right ear . 
McLaggen , can you focus on what you have to do and ignore others ? Harry roared , flying around to face his Cursed . You are not a good example . McLaggen screamed , his face red and angry . And now Harry Potter is quarreling with his Monk , Luna says calmly , while the Hufflepuffs and Slytherins are both laughing and happy . I do not think this helped him find the Snitch , but it was probably a clever trick . Swearing angrily , Harry turned away and flew around the yard again , searching the sky for signs . a small sparkling yellow ball . 
Ginny and Demelza scored each one a table , for the supporters in red gold dress something to celebrate . 
Then Cadwallader scored again , equalizing the score , but Luna did not seem to notice ; She does not seem to care about mundane things such as scores , and has tried to get the crowd's attention to such exotic - looking clouds and Zacharias Smith's ability was impossible . Controlling Quaffle fruit for more than a minute , which is now suffering the name The Incident . 70 - 40 for the Hufflepuff home ! Professor McGonagall growled at Luna's loudspeaker . So then ? Luna said absently . Oh look ! 
The Gryffindor's Torch is holding the stick of the Gunners . Harry returned in the middle of the air . 
Certainly , McLaggen , for reasons that only he knew , took the Peakes ' stick from him and instructed how to hit a Bludger on the incoming Cadwallader . Can you give him the stick and return to the golf position ? Harry screamed , scurrying down McLaggen as soon as he swung the stick up fiercely and beat a clumsy one . 
A terrible pain , a bit of light screaming in the distance and the feeling of falling into a long pipe And the next thing Harry noticed , it was in an extremely bed warm and comfortable and looked up at a light throwing round light on the patchy ceiling . 
She lifted her head hard . On the left is a familiar , red - haired , freckled face . You are very nice to come here with me , Ron said , laughing . 
Harry blinked and looked around . 
Of course : It is in ventricular disease . 
The outside sky was dyed indigo and red . 
The match was over long ago and there was hope for Malfoy . Harry's head was weirdly heavy , he lifted his hand and felt the tape severely . what happened Fractured skull , Mrs. Pomfrey said , rushed and pressed it down on the pillow . There's nothing to worry about , I ' ll fix it soon , but I ' ll have to keep you here all night . 
You should not overpower the next few hours . I do not want to stay here all night , Harry gets angry , gets up and throws the blanket out . I want to find McLaggen and kill him . I am afraid that you are on the threshold of ' extremism ' , says Pomfrey , pushing it back into bed and lifting up the wand with a threatening gesture . You have to stay here until I let you go , Potter , or I ' ll call the Rector . She threw herself into the office , leaving Harry among her pillows , angry . Do you know how much I lost ? he asked Ron in the grinning teeth . Yes , I know , Ron said regretfully . The final result is three hundred twenty and sixty . 
Great , Harry said fiercely . Great ! 
When I found McLaggen You did not have to look for it , now it's as big as you think , Ron said . I myself think that a lot of things have been talked about about it with the Prince's pedicure . 
Anyway , the rest of the team had to deal with it before he got out of here , they were not happy at all . There was an imprint of an irresistible joy in Ron's voice ; Harry could tell that he had no fear of McLaggen being able to do anything like this . 
Harry lay there , staring at the light streaks on the ceiling , his newly cared for skull painless , in fact , very comfortable under the bandage . I can hear the voice from here , Ron said , his voice was choked by laughter . 
I hope that from now on , Luna will be explaining the Deathly Hallows . But Harry was too angry to be funny in this situation , and after a while Ron's cries were lessened . Ginny came to see him while he was unconscious , he said after a long silence , and Harry's mind pounded to quickly create an image in it , Ginny wept in front of the body . It's a confession , she confesses that she really has feelings for him while Ron wishes them good luck . He thinks he comes just in time for the match . 
Why ? 
When you leave , it's still early . Oh , Harry said , when the prospect in his eyes was gone . Well I saw Malfoy flipping out with some girls who did not seem like they wanted to go with him , and it was the second time he was not in the field with the whole school ; He also dropped the previous battle , remember ? Harry sighed . I wish I could follow it right now , the game is a failure , do not be mad , Ron said tough . You can not give up a Quidditch match just for Malfoy , you're the captain ! I wanted to know what he was doing , Harry said . And do not say those things as I imagined , after I heard what it was about Snape saying to each other . I never said you imagined that , Ron said , picking up with his elbow and serious to Harry , but no law says that only one person at a time is allowed to expose something in this place ! 
You were too obsessed with Malfoy , Harry . I mean , thinking of leaving a match just to follow it I want to catch it at the game ! Said Harry in exasperation . I mean , where did it go in the times when it disappeared from the map ? I do not know Hogsmeade ? Ron suggested , yawning . I've never seen it go in secret corridors on the map . 
I think that these are now monitored . Oh , I do not know , Ron said . 
Silence fell between us . 
Harry stared at the lights on the ceiling , thinking that if he had the right to be like Rufus Scrimgeour , it was possible for someone to follow Malfoy , but unfortunately Harry did not have a godly office . Listen to it at all . It's quick thinking to use somehow with the DA team , but once again the problem is that someone will have to leave school ; Most of them , after all , were planning to be packed . There was a snoring loudly , softly at Ron's bed . 
Then a moment Pomfrey left the office , this time wearing a thick coat . 
It is easy to pretend to sleep ; Harry turned to him and heard the curtain shut when he waved his wand . 
The lights dimmed , and she turned back into the office ; He heard the door behind him and knew that she had gone to bed . 
This was , Harry thought himself in the dark , the third time he was put in the clinic by a Quidditch injury . 
Previously it had fallen off the broom because of the appearance of the dreadlocks around the stadium , and the previous time , all the bones had been withdrawn from it by Professor Lockhart was not able to withstand that was the case . Its most painful it still remembers the extreme pain from the bones that grows on its arms for one night , a lack of comfort that is no more pleasant than the unwelcome guests . visiting Harry in the middle of sitting up , his heart pounding , the tape rolled over his head off . 
In the end it had a way : There was an option to follow Malfoy's tail why did he forget , why did not he think about it before ? 
But the question here is , how to call it ? 
What should I do ? 
Quiet , hesitant , Harry said into the darkness . Kreacher ? There was a loud scream , and beatings and quarrels filled the stillness . 
Ron exclaimed . What are you ? Harry pointed his wand at Pomfrey's office door and whispered , Muffliato ! so she can not come out soon . 
Then he crawled to the bottom of the bed to see what was going on . 
The two elves were rolling on the floor in the middle of the room , one dressed in a plumage dress and some woolen hats , the other with a dirty old towel tied around the ribs like a belt . 
Then there was a loud bang , and the Peeves goblin appeared in the air between the two elves fighting . I watched them fight , Potty ! He said resentment , pointing to the fight below , before giving a loud giggle . Watch those little creatures fight , biting any bites , punching , punching Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby anymore , it will not do that again , otherwise Dobby will make it to shut up for he ! Dobby squealed in a high pitched voice . 
kick away , scrape away ! Peeves also squealed happily , now pouring the chunks of the two elves to make them angry again . Turn around , poke fun at each other ! Kreacher will say whatever he likes about his master , oh right , and what kind of master is that , the dirty mess of the Mudblood , oh , what poor Kreacher's mistress would say . Kreacher's mistress said they did not find out , for at that moment Dobby had poked his tiny elbow into Kreacher's throat and knocked out half of his teeth . 
Harry and Ron had to jump out of their beds to pull the two elves away from each other , although they continued to punch each other , mixing up the Peeves , kneeling down around the lamp and reeling . Raise his hand on his nose , hit his nose and pull his ear . Harry hitches his wand to the Peeves and says , Langlock ! Peeves grabbed his throat , swallowed , and ducked out of the room with a disgusting , but inauspicious gesture , with the fact that his tongue was attached to the upper jaw of his mouth . Good , Ron said admirably , holding Dobby in the center of his body so that his pounding hand could not touch Kreacher . Was it another Prince charm ? Oh , Harry said , turning Kreacher's thin arms back . I do not allow you to fight ! 
Hell , Kreacher , you're not allowed to fight Dobby . 
Dobby , I knew I was not allowed to give you orders 
Dobby is a liberal elf and he will listen to anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do ! Dobby said , tears now flowing down his tiny bony face down to the top of his shirt . Good , Harry said , and Ron and Ron both released the elves , they fell to the floor but no longer fighting . The boss called me ? Kreacher exclaimed , drowning in a bow as he gave Harry a look as if he wanted Harry to die in extreme pain . yes , I called , said Harry , looking up at Pomfrey's door to see if Muffliato was still active ; It seems she was not impressed by the shock . I have a job for you . Kreacher would do whatever he wanted , Kreacher said , bending down so low his lips almost touched his thin toes , for Kreacher had no choice but Kreacher was ashamed of having a boy . So , yes , Dobby will do , Harry Potter ! Dobby exclaimed , his big table - like eyes still in tear . Dobby is honored to help Harry Potter ! Thinking about this , it was good having both of them , Harry said . Ok I want you to follow Draco Malfoy . Ignore the emotion of mingling and surly Ron , Harry continued , I wanted to know where he was going , who he met , and what he was doing . 
I want you to follow it all day and night . Yeah Harry Potter ! Dobby said immediately , his big eyes brightening with interest . And if Dobby ruined the job , Dobby would throw himself out of the tallest tower , Harry Potter ! No need to do that , Harry said hurriedly . You want me to follow the Malfoy's youngest ? Kreacher the thé . The boss wants me to spy on the same old bloodline my old mistress ? That's right , Harry said , imagining great dangers and trying to stop them immediately . And he was not allowed to tell him , Kreacher , or tell him what he was doing , or talk to him , or send him messages , or contact him in any way . 
Understand ? He thought it was possible to see Kreacher struggling to find a hole in the hint that it had given and waited . 
After a second or two , and with great satisfaction from Harry , Kreacher bent down again and said , with bitter resentment , he thought of everything , and Kreacher had to follow him . Kreacher is still looking forward to serving Malfoy much more , oh yeah Everything is alright , Harry said . I want regular reports , and try to make me not be surrounded by you when you appear . 
Ron and Hermione . 
And do not tell anyone what you are doing . 
Follow Malfoy's tail like scabs on it . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 20 The Proposal of Lord Voldemort 
Harry and Ron left the hospital the next morning , fully recovering with the care of Mrs. Pomfrey and are now able to enjoy the benefits of being beaten and poisoned , the best of which is Hermione . Make peace with Ron . 
Hermione 
They arrived at breakfast , bringing with them information that Ginny had argued with Dean . 
The demon who is sleeping in Harry's chest suddenly gets up , inhaling the air with hope . They argued for what ? he asked , trying to be normal as they turned to the empty seventh corridor , with the exception of a small girl watching the tapestry of giants in short skirts . 
She was frightened by the presence of the six - year - olds and dropped the balance she was holding . Nothing ? Said Hermione , hurrying to help her . She tapped the wand with a wand and said , Reparo . She did not say thanks , but just stood there as they passed and watched until they were out of sight ; Ron turned to look at her . I bet they are getting smaller and smaller , he says . 
Do not care about it , Harry said , a little impatient . What did Ginny and Dean argue about , Hermione ? Well , Dean was laughing because McLaggen banged Bludgu on him , Hermione said . It may look funny , Ron nodded . It's not fun at all ! Hermione was impatient . It was so bad and if Coote and Peakes did not keep Harry he would be in pain ! Oh , no , it was not necessary for Ginny and Dean to break up because of that , Harry said , still trying to keep his looks normal . Or are they still together ? Oh , you two still Why do you care so much ? Asked Hermione , looking at Harry sharply . I just do not want my Quidditch team to get upset again ! He spoke in a hurry , but Hermione was still very suspicious , and he breathed a sigh of relief as a voice behind Harry ! giving it a reason to turn his back on her . Oh , hi , Luna . I went to the ward to find you , Luna said , rummaging in her pocket . But he was said to have left . She pulled out something that looked like a green onion , a faintly spotted fungus , and a large amount of something that looked like cat feces on Ron's hand , Finally pulling out a filthy filthy scroll for Harry . I was told to bring this to you . It was a small parchment , which Harry immediately recognized as an invitation for the next lesson with Dumbledore . 
Tonight , he told Ron and Hermione , as she opened the paper . The story is very good ! Ron told Luna when she got the blue onions , mushrooms and cat litter . 
Luna smiled dully . Are you teasing me ? it says . 
Everyone says you're bad . No , I'm serious ! Ron is fervent . I can not remember ever hearing more narration than that ! 
Well , what is this ? he added , raising the onion - like object across the eye . Oh , this is a Gurdyroot , she said , stuffing cats and mushrooms in her pocket . You can keep that if you like , I have some . 
They are great to protect themselves from Gulping Plimpies . And she left , leaving Ron to laugh like a gurdyroot , still holding the Gurdyroot . You know , it passed me , Luna , it said , when they left to go to the Hall . I know it's warm , but it's good . It stopped suddenly . 
Lavender Brown is standing at the foot of the marble staircase , looking very fierce . Hello , Ron said anxiously . Come on , Harry whispered to Hermione , and they crossed over , though before they even heard Lavender say , Why do not you tell me you're out today ? 
Why did she go with him ? 
Ron looked pissed and annoyed as he appeared at breakfast half an hour later , and although he was sitting with Lavender , Harry did not see them say a word . 
Hermione was not interested in this at all , but one or more times Harry saw a satisfied smile on her face . 
That day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood , and that evening she consented to review Harry's Herbal Essay , which she had resolutely done since . Denied so far , because she knew that Harry would let Ron copy his articles . Thank you so much Hermione , said Harry , patting her back as she checked her watch and saw that it was almost eight o ' clock . Listen , I ' ll have to hurry , or I ' ll be late for the lesson with Dumbledore . She did not answer , but merely brushed off some of her lack of clarity with a depressed gesture . 
Laughing , Harry ran quickly through the portrait hole and went to the principal's chapel . 
The gutter slid to the side when the toffee was mentioned , and Harry rushed up the stairs two steps to the beat , knocking at the door just eight hours clock . Come on , Dumbledore called , but as Harry reached out to open the door , it came out from inside . There Professor Trelawney appeared . Oh ! she exclaimed , pointing her finger at Harry as she blinked at it through her magnificent glass . So that's why I was kicked out of your office unkindly , Dumbledore ! My Dear Sybill , Dumbledore said in a slightly angry voice , there was no suggestion she would leave unkindly , but Harry had made an appointment , and I really did not think it would be necessary to say good . " Professor Trelawney said , in a deeply hurt tone . If you do not expel that stupid horse right now , that's fine . Maybe I ' ll find another school , where my talent is really good . She jumps out of Harry and disappears after the spiral staircase . The They heard her stumble upon halfway down , and Harry thought she was trapped in one of her long shawls . Please close the door and sit down , Harry , Dumbledore said , sound a little tired . 
Harry obeyed , noting that he sat down in the familiar position at Dumbledore's desk that the Symposium was between them , and there were two small glass jars filled with silver memory . Professor Trelawney is still not happy about Firenze's teaching , is not he ? Asked Harry . Oh , Dumbledore said , Prophecy turned out to be more problematic than I thought , I have never studied this subject . 
I can not tell Firenze to go back to the woods because he's already an outsider , and I can not tell Sybill Trelawney to leave . 
Between us , she could not understand how dangerous she would be if she left the castle . 
You can not know - I think it would be prudent to tell her - that she had prophecies about you and Voldemort , you know . Dumbledore let out a sigh , and said , But do not worry about my teacher . 
We have many more important things to discuss . I have done that task first . What do you tell me to do at the end of the lesson ? Well , Harry jumped up immediately . 
With Turkish and Quidditch lessons , and Ron was poisoned and it broke his skull and trying to figure out what Malfoy was doing , Harry was almost oblivious of the memory Dumbledore had wanted him to extract . Professor Slughorn . Yes , I asked Professor Slughorn about this at the end of the toxicology session , mister , but , er , I did not want to tell you . Have a moment of silence . I understand , Dumbledore finally speaks , looking at Harry through the top of his half - moon glass and giving Harry the familiar feeling that he's under an X - ray . And do you feel that you have done your best in this ? 
Have you tried all your skillful conversations ? 
That you can not have a clue in the investigation and get that memory right ? Sir , Harry stopped , not knowing what to say . 
Its only attempt to obtain a selfless memory becomes shameful . Hmm the bad luck Ron had given him to Professor Slughorn . 
I thought that if I met Professor Slughorn in a better mood , that obviously made me forget about getting that memory ; I did not expect anything while my best friend was in danger . 
As soon as it was clear that Weasley was able to recover completely , though , I hoped that you would return to the mission I gave you . 
I think I made it clear to you how important that memory is . 
Actually , I did my best to impress your child that it was the most important memory and that we would waste time here without it . A sense of shame and pain pierced the entire body from Harry's top . 
Dumbledore did not raise his voice ; he did not even feel angry , but Harry would rather hear him scold him ; This cold temperament is worse than anything else . Sir , it says , it's a bit desperate , it's not something I do not care about or anything , it's just that I have other things . Other things in my mind , Dumbledore finished saying it . I understand . Silence fell between them , the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever felt between him and Dumbledore ; It seemed to be getting worse and worse , only being pierced by the squeal of the dugong from the Armado Dippet portrait on Dumbledore's head . 
Harry felt oddly small , like it had shrunk since it had entered the room . 
When it can not bear anymore , it says , Professor Dumbledore , I really apologize . 
I could have done more . I could have realized that he would not have suggested that I would do this if it did not really matter . Thank you for that , Harry , Dumbledore said quietly . I hope that you will put this task to the forefront from now on ? 
There will be few things to see after tonight unless we get that memory . I will do it to you , I will take it from him , it says seriously . And we do not talk about this anymore , Dumbledore said more kindly , to continue what we have stopped . 
Do you remember where you stopped ? Yes , Harry said quickly . 
Voldemort killed his father and grandfather and made it seem that his uncle Morfin did . 
Then he returned to Hogwarts and he asked if he had asked Professor Slughorn about the Horcruxes , which mumbled sheepishly . That's great , Dumbledore said . Now , I will remember , I hope , that I told you at the beginning of these lessons that we would have to go into the field of inquiry and speculation . Yes , sir . So far , I hope you will agree that I have shown you very accurate sources of my deductions about what Voldemort did under his age of 17 . Harry nodded . But now , Harry , Dumbledore said , now everything is darker and more weird . 
If it is difficult to find evidence of the Riddle child , it is nearly impossible to find people who still remember the Voldemort man . 
Actually , I suspect there is a possibility of a living soul , beside him , who can give us a glimpse of his life after he left Hogwarts . 
However , we have the last two memories that we want to show you . Dumbledore points to the two tiny glass bottles next to the Sign . I would be very happy to have your opinion on the conclusions that we have since the word seems right or not . The idea that Dumbledore appreciates his high opinion would make Harry more embarrassed that he had failed to complete the task of retrieving Horcrux's memory , and that he had erupted in error in his chair when Dumbledore raised her . The first of the two lights up and tests it . I hope that you will not be discouraged from kneading the memories of others , as these will be rather curious memories , these two , he said . 
The first came from a very old elf named Hokey . 
Before we see what Hokey witnessed , we have to report back quickly how Voldemort left Hogwarts . It's the seventh year of the course with , as you would have thought , the highest scores in all the tests it did . 
Around it , their classmates decided on what they would do when they left Hogwarts . 
Almost everyone expects great things from Tom Riddle , the leader of the group , the winner of the Special School Award . 
I know that some of the teachers , Professor Slughorn in there , suggested that he should join the Ministry of Magic , make appointments , put them into beneficial contacts . 
It rejected all suggestions , Voldemort worked at Borgins and Burkes . In Borgin and Burkes ? Harry repeated , suddenly . In Borgin and Burkes , Dumbledore repeated lightly . I think that you will see the pleasures that attracted you when you entered Hokey's memory . 
But this is not the first choice of Lord Voldemort's career . 
It was hard for anyone to know about it - I was one of the few people the principal at that time believed - but Voldemort first went to Professor Dippet and asked if it could stay in Hogwarts as a teacher . okay Do you want to stay here ? 
Why ? Asked Harry , even more surprised . I believe it has several reasons , though it does not say which one to give to Professor Dippet , Dumbledore said . First , and very important , Voldemort did , I believe , be attached to this school than it was to a person . 
Hogwarts was the happiest place ; The first and only place it feels like at home . Harry is a little unnatural to hear these words , because that is exactly what he feels about Hogwarts . Second , the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic . 
It can not be argued that Voldemort has penetrated more of its secrets than most other students go through it , but it may feel that there are still strange things to discover , come . And thirdly , as a teacher , it can have a great influence and influence on young witches . 
It may have taken that thought from Prof . Slughorn , the teacher he had the most intimate relationship with , who showed how the role of a teacher could affect . 
I can not imagine an example where Voldemort has been trying to spend the rest of his life at Hogwarts , but I think it has seen it as a hiring place , and one where it can catch First build it an army . But he was not accepted , right ? No , it was not . 
Professor Dippet told him it was too young at 18 , but invited him back after a few years , if he still wanted to teach . What does he feel about that ? Harry asked , hesitating . Extremely frustrating , 
Said Dumbledore . I advised Armando to refuse the offer - I did not have any reasons to let him know , because Professor Dippet loved Voldemort and believed it to be true . 
But I do not want Lord Voldemort to stay in school , and especially not in a position of power . What does he want to do ? 
What do you want to teach ? Even so , Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore said it . 
Anti Against Art . 
It was being taught at the time by an old professor named Galatea Merrythought , who had worked at Hogwarts for almost 50 years . 
So Voldemort left for Borgins and Burkes , and all the teachers who adored it thought it was a waste , a young , talented sorcerer , working in a shop . 
However , Voldemort is not just an employee . 
Polite and handsome and intelligent , it was quickly assigned to particular jobs that were only in places like Borgin and Burkes , which featured , as you know Harry , things with non - properties . normal and full of energy . 
Voldemort was sent to persuade people to give away valuable items for sale in the shop , and it was , in every way , really doing a good job in the wrong way . Bet that he was , says Harry , can not hold back . Oh , very true , Dumbledore said , with a sly smile . Now it is time to hear the story from the Hokey elf , who worked for a very old and very wealthy witch named Hepzibah Smith . Dumbledore knocked on the bottle with his magic wand , the cork popped out , and he poured a revolving memory into the sign , he said while he was doing it . Harry stood up again and lowered his head to the silver bandage in the stone pot until his face touched it . 
She collapsed through a blackened space and fell into a living room in front of an extremely fat old woman , wearing a fine wig and a gorgeous pink robe cloaking her , making her look like a cake is coming out . 
She was looking at herself in a small jade - glass mirror and rubbed red on her red cheeks with a large amount , while the smallest and oldest elf Harry had ever seen had his legs Maneuver into the sloppy satin sandals . Hurry up Hokey ! Hepzibah said overbearing . He said it would come in 4 hours , only a few minutes left and it never came late . She folded her chalk box as the elf straightened up . The crown of the ejaculator slightly touches the seat in Mrs. Hepzibah's chair , and its thin skin hangs over the skeleton as if it were a piece of hard linen that it was wearing as a cloak . How do we look ? Asked Hepzibah , turning his head to admire the different corners of her face in the mirror . Very nice lady , Hokey hissed . 
Harry might have thought it was Hokey's duty to lie through his teeth when asked such questions , as Hepzibah Smith looked far from beautiful in his opinion . 
The doorbell tinkled and both the hostess and elf rose up . Hurry , hurry up , it's coming , Hokey ! The frantic Hepzibah and the elf rush out of the cramped room with all the items that are very hard to dodge without dropping at least a dozen things : There are boxes full of baby boxes . glossy shades , gold - leafed shelves , globe - shaped caskets , and many butterfly plants planted in copper containers . 
Actually , the room looks like a combination of a magical antique shop and a greenhouse . 
The elf returned for a few minutes and followed him as a tall man that Harry had no difficulty recognizing it as Voldemort . 
He simply wears a black dress ; His hair was longer when he was in school and his cheeks were thinner , but all this suited him ; He looks more handsome than ever . 
He squeezed through the cramped room with the look that had come many times before , and leaned down in front of Hepzibah's chubby hands , kissing it lightly on his lips . I brought her these flowers , he said softly , turning out a bunch of roses from the air . This mischievous boy , do not you do that ! Old Hepzibah squeaked , though Harry noticed that she had a vial ready at the nearest table . Are you damaging this old lady , Tom , sit down , sit down Hokey ? 
The elf entered the room carrying a small plate of bread , which was placed under her master's knee . Naturally , Tom , Hepzibah said , I know you like my cake . 
Well , how are you ? 
You look very pale . 
They made you work so hard at the store , I said it a hundred times , and Voldemort laughed mechanically and Hepzibah laughed . So , what was your purpose for this time ? she asked , blinking her eyes . Mr. Burke wanted another suggestion about the armor made by goblins , Voldemort said . Five hundred Galleons , he thought it was really fair . Do not be so fast , otherwise I think you came here for my jewelery only ! Ms . Hepzibah pouted . I was told to come here only because of that , Voldemort said quietly . I'm just a small employee , who will have to do what he says . 
Mr. Burke wants me to ask , Oh , this Mr. Burke ! Said Hepzibah , waving her small hand . I have this for you to see that I never showed to Mr. Burke ! 
You keep secrets , Tom ? 
Do you promise not to tell Mr. Burke that I have it ? 
He would not let me down if he knew I showed him this , and I would not sell , not Burke , no one else ! 
But you , Tom , will appreciate it for its own history , not because you can have it with so many Galleons . I would be honored to see what Mrs. Hepzibah showed me , and Voldemort said softly , and Hepzibah giggled innocently . I told Hokey to bring me here Hokey , where are you ? 
I want Riddle to see my best asset . Actually , bring both of you here , while you're here , ma ' am , the elf hissed , and Harry saw two boxes of leather , this one Placed on top of the other , moving through the room seemed to be their own special ability , though it knew the little elf was placing them on top of his head as he found his way through the tables , mattress and footrest . Now , Hepzibah said cheerfully , taking the boxes from the elf , putting on his lap , and preparing to open the top , I thought you would like this , Tom , if my family knew Let's see if they can not wait to get into this ! She opened the lid of the box . 
Harry raised his head a little to see better and saw something like a small gold cup with two elaborately carved straps . We wondered if you knew what this was , Tom ? 
Pick it up , watch it carefully ! Hepzibah whispered , and Voldemort held out his long hand and took the cup with one hand from his silk - covered nest . 
Harry thought it was 
saw a flash of red light flashing in his dark eyes . 
His lust was almost externally proportional to Hepzibah's expression , except that her tiny eyes were glued to Voldemort's handsome face . A dinghy here , Voldemort murmured , looking at the carving on the glass . So here it is ? Helga Hufflepuff , just as you know , smart boy ! Hepzibah said , reaching forward with a loud creaking of the blazer and the fact that she was pinching his thin cheek . 
Have not you told me that we have distant relatives ? 
This has been handed down in our house for years . 
Very nice right ? 
And all the powers that it showed , but I did not try to understand all of it , I just keep it safe and beautiful here . She grabbed the cup from Voldemort's index finger and lightly He returned to the box , concentrating on putting it firmly in place and watching the shadow appear on Voldemort's face as the cup was taken away . Now , Hapzibah says cheerfully , where is Hokey ? 
Oh , you brought this to Hokey . The elf obeyed to take the casket , and Hepzibah turned to the much nicer box on her lap . I think you'd love this even more , Tom , she whispered . Bend down to little boy , to be able to see of course , Burke knows I have this , I buy it from him , and dare say he wants to have it again when I leave . Hook silver coins and open the box . There on a crimson velvet layer was a heavy gold jute . 
Voldemort stretched out his hand , unwelcome , and held it up to the light , staring at it . 
The sign of Slytherin , he whispered , when the light made clear a sophisticated S , the way the snake shaped . Right ! Hepzibah said , pleased , and obviously , with Voldemort's look on the locket , was stunned . I have paid the price with one arm and one leg for it , but I can not miss it , a real treasure , I must have it in my collection . 
Burke bought it , apparently , from a ragged woman who seemed to have stolen it where , without realizing its true value . This time , she did not go anywhere : Voldemort's eyes filled up . red when he heard those words , and Harry could see the knuckles of his fingers white out on the locket . 
I dare say that Burke paid very cheaply for this but it is here Very nice right ? 
And again , there is a lot of energy left in this , though I only keep it safe here . " She reached out to retrieve the locket . 
At that moment , Harry thought that Voldemort would not let go of his hand , but then it slipped from Voldemort's hands and back into the red velvet cushion . Okay , Tom , okay , I hope you like that ! She looked completely at his face and not for the first time , Harry saw her stupid clumsy smile . Are you okay boy ? Oh , Voldemort said softly . Yes , I am very good . I think but that's just a lie of light , I suppose . Hepzibah said , looks depressed , and Harry suspected she also saw the red light . from the eyes of Voldemort . Here are the spells as usual , Harry , Dumbledore said softly , and as the elf grabbed the boxes and ran away , Dumbledore took hold of them . Harry was once again on the elbow and they flew over into oblivion and returned to Dumbledore's office . Hepzibah Smith died two days after the scene , Dumbledore said , returning to his seat and signaling that Harry did the same . The Hokey elf was sentenced by the ministry for poisoning the woman's cocoa at night in an unintentional manner . Can not be like that ! Harry is angry . We see that we have the same thought , Dumbledore said . Of course , there are many similarities between this death and the Riddle's death . 
In both cases , someone has been blamed , someone who has had a very obvious memory of having committed the crime . Hokey has himself confessed ? He recalled dropping something into the owner's cup of coffee , which turned out to be not sugar , but a deadly poison that was not known , Dumbledore said . It was concluded that it did not want to do that , but because of old age and wrong Voldemort modified his memory , just as he did with Morfin ! Yes , that's my conclusion , Dumbledore said . And , just like Morfin's case , the Department was obviously suspicious of Hokey because it was just an elf , Harry said . 
It rarely felt empathetic to the SPEW organization Hermione had established . Very accurate , says Dumbledore . He was old , and he recognized the involvement of water , and no one in the department wanted to study the case . 
Just as in the case of Morfin , at the time we met him and tried to get this memory from it , his life was almost over but his memory , of course , did not prove one . Something other than Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket . At the time Hokey was convicted , the Hepzibah family realized that the two most valuable assets had been lost . 
It took a long time for them to realize that , because she had so many hiding places , always protecting her collection in jealousy . 
But when they can no doubt doubt that the cup and locket has disappeared , the staff at Borgin and Burkes , the young man met Hepzibah very often and cast her very much . skilful , resigned and gone . 
Those who rent it do not know where it goes ; They are as surprised as the others because of this disappearance . 
And that was the last time people could hear or see Tom Riddle for a very long time . Now , Dumbledore says , if you do not mind , Harry , I want to stop once again to get you some pointers in our story . 
Voldemort had committed another crime , was not it the first case after he killed the Riddle , I do not know , but I think so . 
This time , as you will see right away , it does not kill because of revenge but for the sake of it . 
She wanted the miraculous spoil that the stupid old poor woman had given her . 
Just as it had stolen from other children in the orphanage , as if it had stolen his Morfin's ring , he had run away with the cup and locket of Hepzibah . No matter what , throwing away his work , just because it's crazy for you , that's possible , but not for Voldemort , Dumbledore said . I hope you will understand in the near future exactly what these things mean to you , Harry , but you also have to admit that it is not difficult to figure out that it has seen the locket , less That is , it must be his . The locket could , Harry said , but why take the cup again ? It belonged to one of the founders of Hogwarts , Dumbledore said . I think it still feels very attached to the school and it can not resist a very important item in the history of the school . 
There are other reasons , I think so . I hope that I can show you these things in a reasonable time . 
And now is the last memory I want to show you , at least until I try to get Professor Slughorn's memory back to us . 
Ten years have passed from Hokey's memory to this , ten years we can only guess what Lord Voldemort is doing . Harry gets up once again when Dumbledore spills his last memory into Sign . Who's the memory ? she asked . Mine , Dumbledore replied . 
And Harry dashed down after Dumbledore through the shimmering silver , landing at the office he had just left . 
There was a Fawkes sleeping comfortably on its branches , and even behind Dumbledore's desk , which resembled Dumbledore , who was beside Harry , though his arms were still intact and not injured . his face , it looks like , less wrinkles . The only difference between the current office and the room here is the snow ; But the blue - green snow is falling through the window frame in my shade and filling at the outer edge . 
The young Dumbledore seems to be waiting for something , and for sure , a moment after they arrive , there is a knock on the door and he says , Go on . Harry sighed heavily . 
Voldemort entered the room . 
His facial features were not what Harry had seen growing up from a large cauldron nearly two years ago : he was not like him , his eyes were red , his face was not like a mask , and However , he is no longer the handsome Tom Riddle . It was like his beauty was burning and blurring ; They have been waxed and distorted in a strange way , and now the whites of their eyes are eternally bloody , though their pupils have not contracted as well as Harry knew they would be . 
He was wearing a long cloak , and his face was as pale as the snowflakes on his shoulders . 
Dumbledore sat behind the table without any unexpected expression . 
Obviously this meeting has been scheduled in advance . Good evening , Tom , Dumbledore said clearly . Do not you sit down ? Thanks , Voldemort said , and he sat down in the chair that Dumbledore was pointing at - the chair that , in the sense of it , Harry was sitting in the present . I heard that he was the headmaster , he said , and his voice was slightly higher and colder than before . A very good choice . I'm glad to accept this , Dumbledore smiled . I invite you a drink ? That would be welcome , says Voldemort . I have come a long way . Dumbledore stood up and turned to the closet he had left the Sign in the present , but then filled the vial . giving Voldemort a glass of wine and pouring himself a glass , he returned to his seat . So what is Tom's pleasure ? Voldemort did not answer right away , but simply drank his glass of wine . They do not call me ' Tom ' again , he says . 
In recent days , I was known by what name I was known by , Dumbledore said , laughing at ease . But to me , I'm afraid that you are always Tom Riddle . That is one of the most annoying of the old teachers . 
I'm afraid that they can not forget the passionate beginnings under their responsibility . He brought the glass up as if congratulating Voldemort , who still did not show his face . 
However , Harry felt the atmosphere in the room changed in an indescribable way : refusing to use Dumbledore's name was Voldemort's refusal to grant Voldemort the right to express the terms of the meeting , and Harry could say that Voldemort understood that as well . 
I was very surprised that he had stayed here so long , Voldemort said after a short time . I always wondered why a witch like me never wanted to leave school . Oh , Dumbledore said , still laughing , with a witch like me , nothing is more important than continuing to teach ancient skills , honing young souls . 
If I remember correctly , I once enjoyed the teaching . I still see that , Voldemort said . I simply do not understand why the man who is frequently consulted by the Ministry , and who twice , I think , was offered a key position of the Ministry . Actually , the last three times Also , Dumbledore said . But the Ministry never attracted me as a job . 
Again , some things we have in common , I suppose . Voldemort lowered his head , did not laugh , and took another sip of wine . 
Dumbledore did not break the silence that was streaming out between them now , waiting , with a very calm expectation , that Voldemort would speak first . 
I came back , he said , after a while , longer , maybe , than Professor Dippet could have imagined but he came back , though , to ask again what he had done . Once told me that you are too young to do . 
I have come to you to ask if you will accept me back to the castle , to teach it . 
I think you must know that you have seen and done so many things since you left this place . 
You can instruct and teach your students what they can not get from other wizards . Dumbledore watched Voldemort from the top of his glass for a moment before speaking . 
Yes , I certainly know that you have seen and done many things since you left us , he said quietly . Rumors of what you did to my old school Tom . 
I regret to believe in half of them . Voldemort's expression is still indifferent when he says , Greatness causes jealousy , envy brings hatred , hatred is born false . 
You must know this , Dumbledore . Did you call it ' greatness ' for what you did ? Dumbledore asked shrewdly . Sure enough , Voldemort said , and his eyes seemed to burn . I tested ; You have pushed the spell limit further , possibly , than anything else you can do for some types of spells , Dumbledore's words gently . Several types . 
As for the other types , I still pity my poorly . For the first time , Voldemort laughed . It was a glare , a wicked thing , more scary than an angry look . A long controversy , he said quietly . But there is nothing in this world that I have ever witnessed to the famous saying of love more powerful than your own , Dumbledore . You may have found the wrong place , Dumbledore suggested . Hmm , so where is the best place for me to start my new research over here , Hogwarts ? Said Voldemort . Will you come back ? 
Can you share your insights with my students ? 
I put myself and my talents under my control . 
I am under the control of the teacher . Dumbledore raised his eyebrows . What are your under - control children ? 
What will happen to those who call themselves - but just rumors ? - Death Eaters ? 
Harry could say that Voldemort did not think Dumbledore could know this name ; He saw Voldemort's red eyes again and the nostrils flared . My friends , he said , after a period of silence , will continue without you , I'm sure . I'm happy to hear you call them friends , Dumbledore said . We have the feeling that they are more like slaves submitting orders . You are wrong , Voldemort said . Then if we come to the Pig Head tonight , we will not be able to find them - Nott , Rosier , Muldber , Dolohov - are you waiting for me ? 
My friends are so dedicated , I must say , to go with me so far in a snow - filled night , just wish you good luck while I'm trying to get a good position in teaching . learn . There is no denying that Dumbledore knew the details of who he was with had made him less welcome ; However , he returned immediately . How are you , Dumbledore ? Oh no , just a waiter's friend , Dumbledore said softly . Now , Tom Dumbledore kept his empty cup and sat on the chair , his fingers knit together as a familiar gesture . Let's talk openly . 
Why did you come here today , surrounded by confidants , to propose a job that we both know you do not want ? Voldemort looks a bit coldly . A job you do not want ? 
On the contrary , Dumbledore , I really want to have it . Oh , I want to go back to Hogwarts , but I do not want to teach like I was 18 . 
What is your purpose , Tom ? 
Why do not you straighten your offer right now ? Voldemort hissed . If you do not want to give me a job of course I do not want to , Dumbledore said . And I do not think that at the moment you think I want to . 
However , I have come here , I asked , you must have a purpose . Voldemort stood up . 
He does not look more like Tom Riddle than anytime , his whole body filled with anger . Is that your last word ? That's right , Dumbledore said , standing up . Then we have nothing to say to each other . No , nothing , Dumbledore said , and a great sorrow fell on his face . That time has passed when I was able to frighten you with a burnt - out wardrobe and made you pay the price of your crimes . 
But I hope that I can , Tom I hope that I was able to For a second , Harry came to the door of shouting a worthless warning : It was sure that Voldemort's hands had come to that . his bag and his wand ; But the moment was over , Voldemort had turned away , the door was closed , and he had left . 
Harry saw Dumbledore's hand clench his arm again and a few seconds later , they stood together almost in the same position , but this time there was no snow on the edge of the window , and Dumbledore's hand black and dead . Why ? Said Harry , looking at Dumbledore's face . Why did he come back ? 
Can you ever know ? I have ideas , Dumbledore said , but nothing else . What's the idea ? I will tell you , Harry , when you get Professor Slughorn's memory , Dumbledore said . 
When you get the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle , everything will , as we hope , be clear to both of us . Harry was still curious and although Dumbledore had gone to the door and kept the door open , it was still standing there . Does he pursue the Dark Arts Defense job again ? 
He did not say yes , he obviously wanted the Dark Arts Defense , Dumbledore said . The result of our brief meeting proves this . 
You see , we have never kept a Dark Arts teacher for more than a year since we rejected Voldemort's place . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 21 The room can not be known 
Harry thought about his brain for weeks , then how could it convince Slughorn to give it a real memory , but nothing of the nature of an idea came up , so it was forced to do It's been doing this for a while now , when it's boring , it's : brooding its poison , hoping the Prince has scrawled something useful at the edge of the book , as he did a lot . Previously . You can not find anything in it , Hermione said reluctantly , late Sunday afternoon . Do not start again , Hermione . 
Harry said that if he did not sit here like this , it would be just that he had listened to Snape in his first year . Said Hermione roughly . 
Harry ignored the girl . 
It has just found a mantra , sectum - sempra , written underneath a very curious letter . For the enemy ! . 
I really want to try it , but it's best not to do it in front of Hemione . 
Instead , it sneaks bookmarks . 
They are sitting by the fireplace in the common room , the only ones who stay out of it are all six of you . 
There was a certain uproar when they came back from dinner and saw a new piece of paper on the bulletin board informing them of the date they were checking their Abilities . 
Those who turn 17 on or before the first day of testing , April 21 , will have the right to register for additional rehearsals to be held at Hogsmead . 
Ron was shocked to read this notice ; It's not terrestrial yet and I'm not ready for the test yet ; Hermione , up to this time , has landed twice , seems a bit more confident ; but Harry , who was not 17 years old for up to four months , could not attend the test whether it was ready or not . However , at least you have the ability to land , Ron said tense , you will not have trouble in July to do it once a new Ron reminds Ron ; It finally managed to disappear and reappear within its round at the previous session . 
Spending too much time worrying about his landings , Ron is now fighting to complete Snape's critically enduring essay , which Harry and Hermione have done . 
Harry fully understands it will get bad grades for this assignment , because it has argued with Snape about the best way to deal with the Dementors ; But it does not matter , the most important thing 
For now it was Slughorn's memory . I tell you , Harry , that stupid prince can not help you to solve this , Hermione said , louder . 
There is only one way to get people to follow what you want , that is to use the control curse , which is illegal , yeah , I know that , thank you Harry , do not look up from the book . 
That's why I'm looking for something else , Dumbledore said that Veritaserum was not , but there must be something else , a poison or a mantra . You are beginning to work erroneously . Hermione says that Dumbledore told you that you only get that memory , which means that only you can convince him while everyone else can not . 
No one can take the poison , but who can not do the word ' belligerent ' ? Asked Ron , shaking the quill pen and staring at his parchment ; Can not be B - U - M , not Hermione , pull Ron's piece of paper towards him . And augury does not have to start with o - r - g . 
What kind of pen are you using ? One of Fred's and George's spell checkers , but I think its magic falls off , sure , Hermione says , pointing her wand at the title of the article . Because we are asked to answer how to deal with Demontors rather than ' Dug - bogs ' , and I also do not remember changing your name to ' Roonil Wazlib ' from time to time . Said Ron , with a look of disgust , do not say that I have to write everything again from the beginning ! No problem , we can fix it . Said Hermione , pulling the article toward her and pulling out the wand . 
Oh , I love you , Hermione . 
Said Ron , leaning back in the couch , tiredly rubbing his eyes . 
Hermione's face turned pink , but she just said no to let Lavender hear you say so Ron said in her hands . Or maybe I ' ll say , then she ' ll forgive me why did not you leave her if you wanted to finish ? - Harry asked you never give up , did not Harry ? Ron said that Cho and Cho were just like each other , so said Harry . What is it that's going to happen between me and Lavender , Ron said , watching Hermione quietly scraping her spelling words with her wand's tail , so that they would repair themselves on paper . But the more I say hint that I want to end the more she cling to me . 
It's like I'm dating a huge gun . Then Hermione said , about 20 minutes later , gave Ron back parchment . More than a thousand times Ron said to me to borrow your pen to write the conclusion ? . 
Harry , have not found anything useful in the Hybrid Prince book until now , looking around ; Now the three of them are the only ones left in the common room , Seamus just went to bed after cursing Snape and his bad essay . 
The only sound was the clatter of the flames in the fireplace and the scuffle of Hermione's pen Ron used to write the end of the paper about the pulpit . 
Harry just closed the book of Blood Prince , yawned , - - Crack ! 
Said Hermione screaming . 
Ron poured ink on his newly completed work , and Harry cried , Kreacher ! 
The elf bent his head and said with his bony toes : He wanted me to bring news regularly about Malfoy and Kreacher came to the news - Crack ! Dobby appeared beside Kreacher , his tea - warmed hat leaning to one side . Dobby also helped , Harry Potter ! he said , throwing Kreacher a look of indignation , and Kreacher should have told Dobby when he was looking for Harry Potter so that we could report it to him . Asked Hermione , still looking shocked at the sudden appearance . what is going on , Harry ? . 
Harry hesitated before answering , because it still did not tell Hermione about having Kreacher and Dobby follow Malfoy ; The elves are always an easy subject to touch for her . Oh , they watched Malfoy for him .. Harry said day and night Kreacher said Dobby did not sleep for a whole week , Harry Potter ! Dobby said proudly , wobbling where he stood . 
Hermione regarded her utter indignation . Are not you sleeping , Dobby ? 
But surely , Harry , you do not have to be sure , of course I do not have Harry hurry to say . 
Dobby , you can sleep , okay ? 
But did any of you find anything ? It hastened , before Hermione interjected again . Malfoy's master moved with a sense of belonging to his pure blood - immediately Kreacher muttered . 
His body is reminiscent of my master's beautiful skeleton and his style is . Draco Malfoy is a bad kid ! Dobby hissed at the angry villain . Then he trembled from the tassel of the tea warmth to the toes of his socks , and ran to the fire as though he were about to dive . 
Harry ( for this it's not quite a surprise at all ) hugged Dobby's stomach and kept it tight . 
Dobby struggled , then shook . Thanks , Harry Potter ! Said Dobby panting . 
Dobby still finds it hard to talk about his former boss . 
Harry dropped Dobby out , fixing his warm tea hat straight and telling Kreacher stubbornly . But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good boss for the elves . We do not need to hear about me falling in love with Malfoy . 
Quickly tell you where Malfoy really went , Harry told Kreacher . 
Kreacher bowed his head again , looking furiously , then said Malfoy eating in the hall , sleeping in the dorm in the basement , he went to study in a pile of daffodils , he said ! Harry said , interrupting Kreacher . Did he go anywhere he should not go ? Harry Potter , Dobby hissed , eyes wide as terrorized by two glittering balls , Malfoy's son did not break any rules as Dobby saw , but he was still worried about being spotted . present . 
He frequented the 7 th floor with a bunch of other students , they were standing guard when he was in ... Room Needed ! " Said Harry , pounding his forehead with his high - grade magazines . 
Ron and Hermione stared at him . That's where he sneaked ! That's where he's going . 
And that fish was the reason why he disappeared on the map . 
Thought , I have never seen the room needed on it . Maybe the map did not know the room was there Ron said . I think it's part of the magic of Hermione's room . If you want it to not show on the map , it will not show . Dobby , did you manage to get inside and know what Malfoy was up to ? " Harry asked earnestly . No , Harry Potter , that could not be said by Dobby . Harry immediately said Malfoy entered our headquarters that way last year so I could go in and spy on him , no problem . 
But I do not think you will , Harry Hermione said slowly . 
Malfoy knew exactly how to operate the room , because the stupid Marietta was bloated . 
Last year you need the room to be the headquarters of the Black Hawk training so it turns out . 
But you do not know what the room will become when Malfoy enters it , so you do not know what to call it ! There will be a way , Harry said roughly . 
You've done a great job , Dobby ! Kreacher did well , Hermione kindly said ; But no matter how grateful he is , Kreacher turns his big eyes , full of bloody red marks and grumbles to the ceiling , the muddy blood talking with Kreacher , Kreacher pretending to be It can not hear that kind of thing ! Harry curled it , and Kracher lowered his head and lowered it . You should also go to bed a bit , Dobby - Harry said thanks , Harry Potter Dobby said happy . 
And it also disappeared . See you ? Harry asked excitedly , turning to look at Ron and Hermione again when the room was empty again . We know where Malfoy is going ! Now we ' ll put him in the wall ! Uh , really , Ron said wistfully , trying to clean a pile of wet ink that was not nearly as long as his near - complete homework . 
Hermione pulled the stack toward her and began rubbing the ink with her wand . But what is he going to do with so many others ? Hermionia . How many people are involved in this ? 
Do not you think he's going to trust those guys and let them know what he's plotting ? Yeah , that's strange , Harry said , frowning . I heard him tell Crabbe what he was doing was not related to him so what did he say to them ? He gazed at the fire . God , I'm silly , he quietly said . 
That is obvious too . 
There is a large jar in the tunnel ... can he steal a little at any time during the robbery ? Polyjuice poisoning . 
He stole some of Polyjuice from Slughorn for us to see in the first drug class where there were a bunch of pupils standing guard for Malfoy , most recently Crabbe and Goyle as always , everything was in sync ! Said Harry , jumping up and began to walk quickly to the fireplace . They are foolish enough to do anything even if Malfoy is not revealing what he is plotting , but he does not want them to be seen lurking outside the Room of Requirement , so he forces them to drink Polyjuice to look . like others . 
My two daughters saw Malfoy go , it was Crabbe and Goyle ! Hermione said in a low voice , the sister that I had adjusted the scale for was , of course , and Harry said loudly , staring at the girl of course . 
Malfoy was sure to be inside the room at the time , so she - I say this - and he dropped the balance to alert Malfoy not to come out , because there was someone standing there ! 
And the little girl dropped the egg . 
We went through him without realizing it ! Malfoy catches Crabbe and Goybe into daughters ? Ron smiled madly at this little girl they were really surprised they did not ask him to do that all the time ! Well , they can not , right ? 
If he had shown them his dark sign , Harry had said he did not know what the dark sign was , no doubt Hermione was saying , rolled Ron's dissertation essay before it took any further damage . And give it to Ron . Then I would know Harry confidently said . 
Yes , I will know , Hermione said , standing up and stretching . But , Harry , before you became so excited about this , I still do not think you should go into the room if you do not know what's in it first . 
And I did not think you'd forget - she threw her briefcase on her shoulder and threw Harry a look that was so grave that her mission was to focus on getting that memory from Slughorn . 
Good night ! Harry looked at her , feeling slightly annoyed . 
Just as the door to the girls bedroom closed behind her , Harry turned to Ron . I wish I could land like the elves Ron said , staring at where Dobby had gone . Then I will do the paperboard as easily as the bag in the bag . 
Harry did not sleep well that night . 
It sank for an hour or so , wondering how Malfoy had used the Room and what , Harry , would see when he went in there the next day , because regardless of Hermione What he said , Harry was sure that if Malfoy was able to see the headquarters of the Dark Arts Defense , it could also see Malfoy's arrival . 
What could that be ? 
A meeting place ? 
Hideout ? 
1 stone room ? 
Or a workshop ? 
Harry's brain works feverishly , and its dreams , when it finally falls to sleep , flutter and disturbed by Malfoy's image turning into Slughorn , then becoming Snape . 
Harry was ready for action in the breakfast the following day ; He had an empty class just before the Dark Arts Defense class and was determined to use it to find the necessary room . 
Hermione showed a disinterested expression in her plans to find the entrance to the room that Harry whispered , which bothered Harry so much , because he thought she would help a lot if she he wants . Seeing this , Harry leaned forward and placed one hand on the Prophecy newspaper just before it had been removed from his mailbox , to stop her from opening it and disappearing behind it . I did not forget about Slughorn , but I still have not got a clue as to how to get that memory from him , and until I came up with an idea , why should not I find out that Malfoy is do you ? I tell you , you need to persuade Slughorn . Hermione says it's not a trick or trick , because Dumbledore can do it in just a second . 
Instead of making a crap out of the Need Room - she snatched the Prophet out of Harry's hand , opened it and glanced over to the first page of Bo so he went to find Slughorn and started begging for a more kindness . Do you have anybody in there ? Asked Ron , while Hermione checked the headlines . yes ! Said Hermione , making both Harry and Ron choked on their breakfast . But no , that person was not dead - it was Mundungus , he was arrested and put in Azkaban ! 
Something involves disguising an inferius in a stealing effort , and someone named Octavius ​​ Pepper has disappeared . 
Oi , and horrible , a 9 - year - old kid was arrested for attempting to kill his parents , who thought he had been manipulated . 
They finished the breakfast in silence . 
Hermione was on her way to study her rune class ; Ron went to the common room , where he had to finish the essay on Snape's Dementor , and Harry went to the 7 th floor corridor with a wall facing the tapestry in which Barnabas and Barmy is teaching the giant devil to dance ballet . 
Harry hugged the invisibility cloak as soon as it came to an empty hall , but he should not have bothered about it . 
When it reaches its destination , no one is there . 
Harry is not sure if the chance of getting into the room is better if Malfoy is in or out of the room , but at least his first attempt is not troubled by the appearance of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be . An 11 year old daughter . 
He closed his eyes as he approached the hidden Needle Room door . 
He knew what he had to do ; Last year it was almost perfect . 
Concentrating all his energy , he thought : I need to know what Malfoy is doing in this place . I need to know what Malfoy is doing in this place . I need to know what Malfoy is doing in this . 
It went through the door three times ; and , his heart pounded eagerly . 
He opened his eyes to the opposite - but he was still looking at an empty wall . 
He moves forward and tries to push one . 
The stone wall is still solid , solid and not submerged . Well then Harry said well I was thinking the wrong way and it weighed a minute and started again , eyes closed , trying to concentrate as much as possible . 
I need to know where Malfoy secretly find you need to know where Malfoy secretly find . 
After three passes , Harry opened his eyes to hope . 
No door . Oh shut up , Harry said exasperatedly to the wall . That's a clear indication ! okay ! Harry thought about it for several minutes before commencing travel again , I want you to become the place where you become to Malfoy . 
He did not open his eyes at the end of his three - hour patrol . 
He listened attentively , as if he could hear the sound of the door bursting open . 
However , it did not hear anything except the distant hiss of the birds outside . 
He opened his eyes . 
There is no door at all . 
Harry cursed . 
Someone is screaming . 
He looked around and saw a group of freshman students running back and forth across the corners , obviously looking like they had just encountered a rude ghost . 
Harry tried every variant of the sentence I needed to see what Draco Malfoy was doing inside you that he could think for hours , finally it was forced to admit that Hermione was probably right : single room I do not want to open the door to it . 
Disappointed and frustrated , he made his way to the Dark Arts Prevention classroom , pulled off the invisible cloak and tucked it into his briefcase as he walked . Later , Potter , Snape said coldly , as Harry hurried into the study room lit by candles . Eliminate Griffindor 10 points . Harry scowled at Snape and threw himself into the chair next to Ron . 
Half of the class is still standing when it comes in , getting books out and arranging their belongings ; It can not be too late for any of them . 
Before we get started , we want the essay on Dementors of Snape to say , waving the careless chopsticks , and 25 scrolls of parchment soaring into the air , landing in a neat stack on his desk . And hopefully , for the sake of these games , these will be better than what we have to endure in the defense of the previous spell . 
Now open the book to the page - something , Mr. Finnigan ? Sir , Seamus said , I wondered how to recognize the difference between an Inferius and a ghost ? 
Because there was something in the newspaper about Inferius - - no , Snape said in a depressed voice . But teacher , I heard people say - if you read the article being really mentioned , Mr. Finnigan , then you should know the so - called Inferius is nothing but a stealthy stalker . Named Mundungus Fletcher . I think Mundungus and Snape are the same , Harry whispered to Ron and Hermione . 
Why are not you sad when Mundungus was arrested ? " But Potter seems to have a lot to say about the subject , " Snape said , suddenly pointing to the back of the room , his black eyes staring at Harry . Let's ask Potter how he realized the difference between an Inferius and a ghost . The class turns to look at Harry , who rushes to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night they went to Slughorn . 
Oh - ah - the ghost is transparent - it says . 
Oh , very good , Snape cut off , his lips curled up . Oh , it's easy to see that 6 years of teaching magic has not cost you money . ghost is transparent . 
Pansy Parkinson uttered a high - pitched chuckle . 
Many others laughed silly . 
Harry took a deep breath and continued to calm , though it was boiling inside . 
Yes , ghosts are transparent , but Inferius is dead , yes , they will be solid . - A 5 - year - old kid can tell me that much . Snape smirked . Inferius is a corpse that was breathed in again by the curse of the Dark Wizards . 
It does not live , it is only used as a puppet to follow the orders of the mages . 
A ghost , as we believe you have known until now , is a trace of a dead soul left on the ground , and of course , as Potter was very wise to tell us , crystal - clear . Sir , what is said by Harry is the most useful thing when we are trying to distinguish between them ! Said Ron . If we have to face it under a valley , we will see if it is solid , right ? 
We are not going to ask him Sorry , are you a trace of a deceased person ? A great wave of laughter erupted , instantly quenched by Snape's look thrown at the class . Eliminate 10 points from Griffindor Snape . I do not expect anything more elaborate from the game , Ronald Weasley , the boy is so solid that he can not land half an inch across the room . Ko ! Hermione whispered , grasping Harry's arm as he aggressively opened his mouth . No matter what , you just end up with a ban again , leave ! Now , open your book to page 213 Snape laughed contemptuously and read the first two chapters of the Cruciatus curse ! Ron was very indifferent throughout the lecture . 
When the bell rings at the end of the class , Lavender catches up with Ron and Harry ( Hermione has mysteriously disappeared as she approaches ) and snaps at Snape for the sneer of Snape's rampant lore , But this seemed to only make Ron more upset , and he fled the girl by fleeing at the men's room with Harry . Still , Snape was right , right ? Said Ron , staring at the mirror for a minute or two . 
I do not know whether it is worthwhile for me to participate in the test , no , I just really do not grasp the permissive territory . Even so , you should attend the practice session at Hogsmead , and see how it goes , says Harry philosophically anyway , more interesting than trying to jump into a wall like me . 
Then , if you still - you know - not as well as you would like , you can postpone the test , do with me in the summer - Myrtle , where is the boy's bathroom ! The ghost of a girl swimming up from the lettuce of the room behind them and now hovering in the air , poking them through the round glasses , thick and white . Oh , he said sadly . 
Are you looking forward to 2 games ? Asked Ron , looking at her in the mirror . No one , Myrtle said , molded a pimple on the chin in a way . He said he would come back to me , and then he said he would visit me - she gave Harry a scolding look - and I did not see him for months , months . 
I have learned how not to expect so much from the boys I think you live in a female toilet ? Harry said , he had carefully avoided that place for several years . That's right , she said , with a small shrug . But that does not mean I do not go to other places , I visited you in the bathroom once , remember ? I remember thinking I liked her , she said . 
If two moves away , he will come back again . 
We are very compatible . 
I'm sure he feels it too . 
And she looked out the window with hope . When she said that they were getting along well , Ron said , this sounds pretty interesting right now . 
You mean he lives in a toilet ? Myrtle stubbornly said , her voice echoing through the old bathroom . I mean , he's very sensitive , others are also bullying him , and he feels lonely and has no one to talk to , and he is not afraid to express his feelings and cry ! Is there a son crying in here ? Harry asked curiously . a young child ? Unrelated to Myrtle , her small eyes turned to Ron , who was clearly grinning now . I promised myself that I would not tell anyone , and I would keep his secrets down - not to the tombs ? Said Ron with a snort . Down the drain , perhaps so . 
Myrtle whistled angrily down and down the toes - let go again , splashing water on both sides and down the floor . 
Myrtle seems to have made Ron cheer up a little . You're right , he said , tossing his pair up on his shoulders , I'm going to attend a rehearsal at Hogsmead before deciding whether to take the test or not . And so on the weekend , Ron joins Hermione and the others . The sixth is just 17 years old to take the test in two weeks . 
Harry felt a bit jealous when they were all ready to enter the village ; He missed the trip there , and that day was a beautiful spring day , one of the most clear of the sky that they had seen for a very long time . 
However , it was decided to take the time to try to do another attack on the necessary room . You will do better , Hermione said , as Harry revealed his plans to Ron and Hermione in the entrance to the hall . If you go straight to Slughorn's office and get his memory . I'm trying ! Harry said frustratedly , that was absolutely true . 
It had always lagged behind every week of drug rehab in an attempt to corner Slughorn , but the poison professor always left the room so quick that Harry could not catch him . Two times Harry came to his office and knocked on the door , but no one answered , although on the second he was sure he had heard the sound of an old jukebox doused by someone . He did not want to talk to me , Hermione ! 
He knew he was trying to get him out again , and he did not let that happen ! Yes , but you just have to be patient , okay ? A short stream of people waiting in turn to pass through Fitch inched forward a little , he is doing routine work with the secret Sensation . 
Harry did not answer for fear of being overheard by the supervisor . 
He wished Ron and Hermione luck , then turned and climbed the marble stairs again , resolutely , no matter what Hermione said , giving him one or two hours for the necessary room . 
Once out of sight from the hallway hall , Harry withdrew the map of the robber and the invisibility cloak from his briefcase . 
After hiding in the coat , it knocked on the map , murmuring : I solemnly vowed that I was worthless , and checked carefully . 
Because it was a Sunday morning , almost all the students were in the same common room of the house . 
The Griffindor is in a tower , Ravenclaw in another tower , Slytherin in the basement , and the Hufflepuffs in a basement near the kitchen . There are some strangers wandering around the library or up the stairs . 
Some were in the schoolyard , and , alone in the seventh corridor , was Gregory Goyle . 
There was no sign of the room needed , but Harry did not care about it ; If Goyle was standing outside the door , it would indicate that the room was open , whether the map recognized it or not . 
So it ran all the way up the stairs , only to slow down as it reached the corner of the hall , and it began to creep in , extremely 
Slowly , towards the very familiar little girl who was gripping the copper balances that Hermione had been so kind to fix two weeks ago . 
He waited until it was right behind her before the very bottom was low and bold : Please be beautiful too , is not it ? Goyle gave a screaming scream , threw the scales to the sky and sprinted away , then disappeared before the crashing sounds of the scales echoed in the corridor . 
Laughing , Harry turned around to look at the empty wall , and then Harry was sure that Draco Maldoy was frozen , realizing that there was an unlikely outsider , but he did not dare to risk it . present . That gave Harry a most pleasant feeling of strength when he tried to remember what kind of speech he had not tried . 
But the mood of hope does not last long . 
Half an hour later , after trying many more distortions of requesting to know what Malfoy was plotting , the wall still did not have a raw door at first . 
Harry can not believe it . 
Malfoy is probably just a few steps away from it , so there is still no evidence of what he is pursuing here . 
Completely lost patience , Harry ran to the wall and kicked it . ouch ! He thought it would break his toes ; he clutched his big toe and jumped on one leg , an invisible cloak slipping out of it . Harry ? He turned around on one leg , and fell to the ground . 
And standing there , making it amazing , was Tonks . 
She walked up to her as if she had been strolling so much in this corridor . 
Harry thought she looked pathetic : she was sicker than usual , and her hair was mottled . What are you doing here ? Said Harry , standing up ; Why should she always find it lying on the floor ? I went to find Dumbledore Your office is not here . Harry said It was on the other side of the castle , behind the gutter - I knew Tonks said he was not there . 
Obviously , he is going again . really ? Said Harry , carefully placing his bruised feet to the floor . I do not think you know where you are going , right ? I do not know Tonks said . What do you want to see ? Nothing special , Tonks said , poke at the shirt loosely , I just thought maybe he knew what was happening just to hear rumors that someone was injured . All of them were mentioned in the press , Harry said the little boy was going to kill her parents . The prophecy usually followed the times , Tonks said , she did not seem to be listening to her . Who received the letter from the Association of all ? No one in the Society wrote to me anymore , since Harry said Sirius . Harry saw Tonks eyes glaze tears . I'm sorry , Harry said awkwardly I mean I miss him too What ? Tonks said empty , as if she did not hear anything . Well , you ' ll see me again , Harry . Then she suddenly turned and walked down the corridor , leaving Harry behind to stare intently . 
After about a minute or so , she put on a back - up gown and regained her mental strength to try to get into the Need Room again , but her mind did not focus on it . 
In the end , a feeling of laziness in the abdomen and knowledge that Ron and Hermione will soon return to lunch prompts him to give up his final effort and return the empty corridor to Malfoy , in hopes of overflowing . Swore that Malfoy would be too scared to go out for hours . 
He found Ron and Hermione in the hall , eating half of their early lunch . I can do it - yeah , so rough Ron told Harry excitedly as soon as Ron saw it . I was screaming to the outside of Mrs. Puddifoot's tea shop and I was a little farther away , landing near Scrivenshafts , but at least I was moving ! That's great , Harry said . Are you doing well , Hermione ? Oh , fine , of course , Ron said , before Hermione could answer . Perfect for thinking , predictable , and reckless or monstrous . 
We all go to a drink at the Three Broomstands and you should be there to hear Tyycross talk about her - I would be too surprised if he did not ask Hermione for a wife soon . And what about you ? Asked Hermione , ignoring Ron . Do you need the room all the time ? Oh , and said , guess who I met there ? 
Tonks ! Tonks ? Both Ron and Hermione echoed , overwhelmed . Well , Ron said after he finished the job , describing the conversation between him and Tonks . She is a bit exhausted . 
Disappointed after all that has happened in the Ministry of Magic . 
That's strange , Hermione said , for something that looked very suspicious . She has a duty to guard the school , why did she suddenly leave her place to find Dumbledore while he was not there ? I have a hypothesis , Harry said hesitantly . 
He felt strange when he said this . This belongs to Hermione's field rather than it . Do not you think he is Sirius ? Hermione gazed at it , what did you think ? I do not know , Harry said , shrugging , but she nearly cried when I mentioned his name , and her guardian is now something of four legs , I wonder if it is you know That was a thought Hermione slowly said But I still do not understand why she stormed the castle to find Dumbledore , if that was the reason she was there . What I said earlier when Ron said , a bunch of potatoes chopped into his mouth . She is a woman , she is wise to tell them they are very melancholy , though , says Hermione , out of her thoughts . I figured out that a woman was sulking for half an hour just because Rosmerta was not laughing at their joke about a witch , a healer and a Mimbulus mimbletonia . Ron scowled . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 22 After the Burial 
Bright blue skies began to appear above the tower , but signs of the coming summer did not make Harry better . 
It was interrupted , both in trying to figure out what Malfoy was doing , and also 
In an attempt to talk to Slughorn trying to find his memory . " According to me ( ? - font - wasabi error ) , you just forget Malfoy , " said Hermione resolutely . 
Now they were sitting with Ron in the corner of the sunny courtyard after lunch . 
Hermione and Ron are clutching the Ministry of Magic's propaganda flyer - Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them - to talk about the test . 
Ron was startled and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl walked around them . " Not Lavender . " Hermione was tired . " Oh , good luck , " said Ron , " Are you Harry Potter ? " She said , " I was asked to give you this . " " Thanks . " Harry's heart collapsed as he picked up a small roll of parchment . 
When she was out of earshot , she said , " Dumbldore says we will not take any more lessons until we find the memory . " " Maybe he wants to check that we're doing " Hermione commented , Harry opened the parchment ; For a long , short , snappy twist , it is difficult to read properly because of the large ink stains on the run . 
Harry . Ron and Hermione ! 
Aragog died last night . 
Harry and Ron , you met him and know how special it is . 
Hermione , you know I do not like it . 
It would be very meaningful for me if you are willing to come down here in this late afternoon burial . 
I'm planning to do it in the evening , it's my favorite time of the day . 
I know you are not allowed to go out at night , but you can use the invisibility cloak . Do not ask , but I will not do it alone . 
Hagrid . " Look at this , " said Harry , handing the letter to Hermione . " Oh , my dear , " the little girl said , flipping through it and looking at Ron , reading it with increasing suspicion . " He's crazy . " He was angry . " Saying that , we are helping ourselves ! 
And now Hagrid is looking forward to going down there and crying out on that hairy corpse ! " Not only that . " Hermione said , " He told us to leave the castle at night and he knew the security was being tightened and how troublesome if we were caught . "" We're going to see him before tonight , " said Harry , " okay , but for what ? " We took the risk to help Hagrid , but after all - the death of Aragog . 
If that's the question of saving it - "" I do not want to go , " said Ron firmly . " You can not see him , Hermione . 
Believe me , dying will be better with it . " Harry picked up the ink and smeared it down . 
The pieces were torn , fat and swiftly floating over the paper . " Harry , you can not think of a walk , " said Hermione . " Not worthy of being banned . " Harry sighed . " Oh , I know , " he said . " He will bury Aragog without us . " " Yes , he will , " said Hermione , serene . " Look , drug poisoning is almost free this afternoon , with our test . Try to make Slughorn calm down a bit . " " Lucky pills , what do you think ? " Hary said . 
" Luckily , " said Ron suddenly . " Harry , that's right ! " " What do you want ? " " Used to be lucky . " " Oh Ron , yes ! " Hermione said , sounding stunned . " Of course ! 
Why do not you think about it ? "" Felix Felicis , " said Harry , " I do not know . I'm not the one to use it . " What does that mean ? " Ron asked suspiciously . " What is more important than Slughorn's memory , Harry ? " Hermione asked . 
Harry did not reply . 
The red - haired girl in her head is embroiled in a vague and unresponsive plan , as Ginny breaks up with Dean , and Ron will gladly accept Ginny with her new boyfriend . , has boiled deep in his brain , always against it during dreams in the morning or half - dream . " Harry ? 
Do you still sit with us ? " Hermione , " she said , " Ah , of course , " he regained his composure . " Okay . 
If I can not pull Slughorn out to talk this afternoon , then maybe I ' ll use Felix and I ' ll go to another place tonight . "" That's clear , " said Hermione briskly and dancing to her feet . " Where do you go ? " she whispered . " Oh , stop it . " Ron pleaded , " I'm tired of it . , hide yourself ! "" No Lavender ! ! " Hermione said impatiently , when two girls appeared at the yard and Ron jumped behind Hermione . " Great ! " Ron looked over Hermione's shoulder and said , " Oh , they're not very happy , are not they ? "" They are Montgomery sisters and of course they are not happy at all , do not you hear what happened to their brother ? " I'm wondering what's going on with their cousin , very sincere , " said Ron . " Well , they were attacked by werewolves . 
It is rumored that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters . 
Anyway , he was only 5 years old and had died in St . Mungos Hospital , they could not save him . " He died ? " Harry repeated his indignant voice . " But obviously the werewolves did not kill , they just turned the others into them ? "" Sometimes they have to kill , " said Ron , now looking unusually stern . " I heard that was happening when the werewolf was dragged by someone else . " What was the waswolf's name ? Well , according to rumors , is Fenrir Greyback , " said Hermione . " I know him - the crazy guy likes to bite children , Lupine said to me ! " Harry was angry . 
Hermione looked at him wearily . " Harry , you have to get that memory , " she said . " That's all there is to stop Voldemort , right ? 
The horrible things that were happening knocked him down . The bell rang on the castle that made Hermione and Ron jump , looking horrible . " You two will do fine , " Hary said to them , as they headed for the tower to meet the rest of the audience who were talking about the Shown Bead test . " Good luck . " " You too ! " Hermione said meaningfully , as Harry went to the tower . 
This afternoon , only three people in the drug poisoning : Harry , Ernie and Draco Malfoy . " Ah well , " exclaimed Slughorn . " Because our class is quite small , we will do something for fun . 
I want to show you some fun games ! "" That sounds good , Professor , " Ernie cried , rubbing his fingers together . 
Malfoy , 
do not smirk " What do you mean , ' some fun ' ? " It was irritating . " Oh , that surprised me , " Slughorn said softly . 
Malfoy opens his book , Dispensing - Superior Poison , with a bleak look . 
Not simply is it that this lesson is a waste of time . 
Sure enough , Harry thought , as he watched it through the head of the book , Malfoy craved for the time he had not spent in the Need Room . 
To her mind , like Tonks , was Malfoy , looking thin . 
Of course Malfoy looked skinnier ; Its skin is tinged with ash color , while it is usually very rarely seen in the sun ; Not as wild as it usually is on every Hogwarts Journey , or when it publicly boasts the task that Voldemort entrusted to him . These are the only conclusions that , in view of Harry : The task , whatever the reason , is acting very badly . Inspired by that thought , Harry skimmed through the Advanced Pharmacopoeia and sought some explanation from the Prince of Hybrids about the " insanity drug , " which does not seem to follow the words . Slughorn's instructions , but with the power ( Tim jumps when that thought hits his head ) will make Slughorn feel better and he will be ready to hand over his memories to Harry if Harry Well , now they look great , " Slughorn said after an hour and a half , clapping his hands as he spread the gold solution in Harry's cauldron below . sunlight . 
" Drugs cause dementia , take a look ? 
And to see what we smell smell ? Mmmm for extra mint , right ? 
Not exactly , but for what you try , Harry , of course , will not have excessive side effects and do not pinch - the nose tries to say " I really do not know how to get a good brain . Where are you , son ? unless - " Harry took the book of the Prince of Hyde in his bag . " Yes , that's possible , " said Harry , feeling exhausted . 
Ernie was looking rather choppy : her solution was frozen into a lump like a purple dumplings in the middle of the cauldron . 
Malfoy was ready to pack up . 
Slughorn claims that his hiccup solution is only called " temporary acceptance . '' ; The bell rang , both Ernie and Malfoy leaving at once . " Professor ! " Harry started , but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder ; When he saw that there was no one but him and Harry , he quickly disappeared as quickly as he could . " Professor - Professor , you do not want to taste it - " Harry risked calling . 
But Slughorn was gone . 
Frustrated , Harry dumped them in the cauldron , wrapped them up and left the tower , and down the stairs to the teacher's room slowly . 
Ron and Hermione returned from the afternoon . " Harry ! " Hermoine screamed as she crawled through the portrait hole . " Harry , I'm over ! " " Good job ! " She said . 
" And where is Ron ? " " He - he slipped , " Hermione whispered , as Ron went down to the room with his face gloomy . " It was unlucky , just for the sake of a little thing , the examiner found out he had left his brow behind his ass . What was your story with Slughorn ? " " Not very happy , " said Harry . Ron interrupted . " Unluckily , but next time you ' ll be sitting - we can do it together . " " Oh , I think so , " snapped Ron , " but a half eyebrow - no problem ! " " I know , " said Hermione gently , " what a frustration " 
They spend the evenings talking badly about the testimony of the Transfiguration , and Ron is very upset and now they continue to talk about Slughorn's memory . 
So , Harry - will you use Felix Felicis or something else ? " Yes , I suppose I would do well , " said Harry , " I do not think I need them , not twenty to four hours , I can not take them all . take a sip . 
Two or three hours later it will be used . "" That was a great feeling when you used it , " recalled Ron . " It's like being unable to do anything wrong . "" What are you saying ? " Hermione laughed . " You never used it ! " Oh , but I think I'm already using it , right ? " Really different . " They just saw Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew he would be sitting there until the end of the meal , so they stayed for a while in the living room . Overall , and the plan is that Harry will go to Slughorn's room again until he has time to come back . 
When they came down to the tops of trees in the forbidden forest , they decided to go , and after careful examination Neville , Dean and Seamus were both in the teacher's room , they quietly arrived at the dormitory . Amnesty for boys . 
Harry pulled out some curly socks in the middle of the suitcase and pulled out a tiny jar , sparkling weak sparks . " Okay , come here , " said Harry , he held up the small jar and after measuring the medicine in the jar he swallowed . " How do you feel , " Hermione whispered . 
Harry did not answer for a moment . 
Then , slowly but very clearly , the innermost feeling of excitement passed through it ; It felt like it could do everything , everything and getting Slughorn's memory seemed impossible not only to be able to do it , but it was also easy . It started with a pounding , laughing and full of confidence . " Excellent , " it said . " Really excellent . 
I will go down to see Hagrid . "" What ? " 
Ron and Hermione exclaimed . " No , Harry - you must go see Slughorn , remember ? " Hermione said . " No , " Harry said confidently . " Minhg will go to Hagrid's house , I have a great feeling to go to see him . " " You found buried a giant spider ? " Ron was surprised . " Yes , " said Harry , pulling the invisible cloak out of his bag . " I feel that's the place , do you know what that means ? " " No , " Ron and Hermione agreed , now they look so frightened . " This is Felix Felicis , do you think so ? " Hermione worried , raising the vase out of the light . " You do not have any more jars filled - I do not know - " " Insane substance ? " Ron suggested , as Harry put on his overcoat . 
Harry laughed , and Ron and Hermione looked more frightened . " Believe me , " he said . " I know what I'm doing or at least like that . " He walked confidently to the door . " He pulled the cloak over his head and started to go down the stairs , Ron and Hermione quickly . move forward it . Towards the end of the stairs , Harry gently flushed open the wings . " Hey , what are you doing here with her ? " Lavender Brown grinned , staring at Harry as Ron and Hermione appeared together in the male dorm room . 
Harry heard Ron stammer behind him as he rushed out of the room . 
Climbing through the portrait hole became easy , as it came close , Ginny and Dean went through it , and Harry ran past them . 
As it passed , it hit Ginny . " Do not push me , please . 
Dean , " she said , sounding disturbed ; " I'm always doing that . " The portrait was closed behind Harry , but he heard Dean recoil . Harry scrambles to the castle . 
It did not go crooked , and no one was on the way , but it did not surprise him at all . 
For this reason , it was the hottest guy in Hogwarts . 
He had no idea why he knew that going to Hagrid was a good thing , though , despite the fact that the drug had shone a few steps away . 
He could not see the final destination , he could not see where Slughorn had come , but he knew it was heading in the right direction to get the memory . 
When it came to the hall , it was revealed that Mr. Flich had forgotten the front door lock . 
In the open , Harry opened his mouth and breathed in the clean smell of air , and for a moment before going down the stairs into the dim darkness . It was when it reached the final stairs that suddenly popped up in his mind that it would be so cute if it would bring some vegetables in its path to Hagrid . 
It immediately turned to the piece of vegetables , which was satisfied , but not surprisingly , when Professor Slughorn found a conversation with Professor Sprout . 
Harry hides behind a low stone wall , feels peaceful around the world and listens to their conversation . " I thank you for taking the time , Pomona , " slughorn courteously , " Many experts agree that they are very effective if picked at dusk , " " Oh , I totally agree , " Professor Sprout said warmly . " Is this enough ? " " Too much , too much , " said Slughorn , whom Harry saw , holding a pile of leaves full of leaves . 
" It will give some leaves for every third year of my life , and a little more if someone can hardly cook them . Good morning , good morning , thank you very much , " said Professor Sprout . Road to his greenhouse , and slughorn approached where harry stood , invisible . Grabbing his right arm in front of him , Harry waved his jacket . " Goodbye to Merlin's beard , Harry , that made me jump , " Slughorn said , " how did you get to the castle ? " " I think Filch Harry locked the door , " and glad to see Slughorn angry , " I ' ll have to report back that this guy , he cares about rubbish rather than security right if he asks me . Why are you out here , Harry ? "" Yes , Professor , that's for Uncle Hagrid , " said Harry , knowing that the only thing he had to do was tell the truth . " He is in crisis But he will not say who , not professor ? 
I do not want him to get in trouble . " Slughorn's curiosity was obviously aroused , " Well , I can not promise that , " he gruffed . 
" But I know that Dumbledore believes him , so I'm sure he can not do anything terribly horrible . " " Yes , it's a giant spider , he fed it all year . I can say it and all that - "" I hear rumors that he has spiders in the woods , " Slughorn said gently , looking at the pile of black trees . 
" That's true , is not it ? " " Yes , " said Harry . 
" But it was a child , Aragog , the only child Hagrid had , it was dead yesterday . 
He was dismayed . 
He needs a friend when he bury him and you say you will come . "" so moving , so moving , " Slughorn said absently , his eyes closed in concentration on the distant light from Hagrid's hut . " But spider venom is well worth it . If the animal is dead , its strength will not be lost . Of course , we will not do anything unintentionally if Hagrid is suffering . But if there is no way to get it , , it is almost impossible to get venom from a spider if it is alive . " Slughorn seemed to be talking to himself rather than Harry . " That would be a terrible waste if you did not get it ... a pint of strength that was worth a hundred Galleons . Tell me , my salary is not much . " And now Harry saw clearly what he had done , " Yes , " she said , with the most convincing hesitation , " Well , if you want to go there , Professor , Hagrid will definitely be pleased ... 
For Argord the most offensive , you know . "" Yes , of course , " said Slughorn , with the enthusiasm now flowing from his weak eyes . " I say that , Harry , I will . Meet down with one or two jars . We ' ll drink it because it's scary - uh - not healthy - but we ' ll fend for it in a different way , basically , because it's only once . buried . 
And I'm going to change my bond , this is a little bit of my sentiment for this dip . " He rushed back to the castle , and Harry hurried to Hagrid's place , feeling satisfied . " Come on . " Hagrid grunted , as Harry opened it and Harry appeared from the invisible cloak in front of him . " Yes - though Ron and Hermione can not come , " said Harry , " they are really sorry . " No - it's okay . " Hagrid hugged one of them so well , he made himself a glove that looked like a piece of cloth dipped in shoe polish , and his eyes were puffy , red . , and increase . 
Harry patted his elbow , which was the highest point he could reach . " Where do we bury it ? " He asked . " In the woods ? " " Oh , no , " said Hagrid , wiping two eyes that were streaming down the center of his shirt . 
" The other spiders do not allow us to come close to their network . 
It is the only order that we can not eat meat ! 
Can you believe that , Harry ? "" The very honest answer is " Yes " ; Harry said with a hard effort as he and Ron came to face the spiders . 
It was certainly clear that Aragog was the only thing that blocked them from eating Hagrid's meat . " There has never been a place in the forest that we have not been to before ! " Said Hagrid , shaking his head . 
" It's not easy , to have the Aragod's body here , I can tell you - they eat the flesh of their fellow human beings , see no . But I want to give it a nice burial . " He puffed up again and Harry patted his elbow again , saying that he did very well ( which seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do ) . " Professor Glughorn came down to see us here , Hagrid . " " No trouble , " Hagrid said , looking frightened . " You can not get out of the castle at night , I know , it's my fault - " " No , no , when he hears what I do , he says he will come and pay respect . His teacher came to Aragog , " said Harry . " He said he would come here to change some things to fit , I think and he said he would bring some vases and we would drink to remember Aragog . " " He did that ? " Said Hagrid , looking surprised . " Really - what a nice person , indeed , . 
Did I really ever talk to Slughorn before coming here and kick off Aragog ? 
Hic , it will like that , Aragog will " : 
Harry thinks privately that Aragog will like Slughorn much of Slughorn's meat that he can eat , but it merely goes to the back of Hagrid's hut window , when he sees the terrible spider The fur is lying dead outside , the legs tangled and messy . 
" We ' ll bury him here , Hagrid , in the garden ? " " I think the pumpkins are on the other side , " said Hagrid in a twang . 
" I have digged - you know - the tomb . 
I just think we're going to say some good things about it - merry jerks , you know - " his voice trembled and broke . 
The door opened and he turned to answer it , blowing the scent from his old , delicate handkerchief . 
Slughorn flipped open the door , clamped on his hands , and put on a dark tie . " Hagrid , " he said gravely . " Very sorry about your loss . " " You are so kind , " Hagrid said . " Thank you very much , and thank you for not keeping Harry . " " A sad , sad night ? " " Out there , " said Hagrid in a shake . " We - will we do it ? " They stepped back out into the garden . 
The moon glowed through the trees , and the light blended with the light from Hagrid's window illuminated the Aragog's body lying next to a large hole next to a ten foot tall mound . " Good luck , " Glugh said , walking to the top of the alley , where one of the little boys was standing in the doorway . yo ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho hoi hoi hoi hoi , cong nho , moi moi , trong lan ho . " Really , " Slughorn said , reaching for the eardrumhead , where eight eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge , curved , immobile Moonlight . 
Harry thought he could hear the tinkling sound coming from the jar when Slughorn came to look at them , looking as if he was looking at his hair . " No one can understand how beautiful they are , " Hagrid said as Slughorn returned , tears streaming from his eyes . 
" I do not know that you care about a creature like Aragog , Horace . " " Interested ? 
Oh my god , Hagrid ! " Slughorn said , stepping closer from the corpse . 
Harry saw the sparkle of the jar appear beneath his coat . 
Harry thought , wiping his eyes again , was nothing to say . " Now can we start the burial ? " Hagrid nodded and followed . 
He struggled to pick up the big spider on his hand , and with a grunt , he rolled it down into the black hole , causing it to fall into the middle of the pit for a faint hiss . 
Hagrid starts to cry again . " Of course , it is hard for him , who knows it better than anyone else , " Slughorn said , who , like Hary , could not reach to Hagrid's elbow , but patted on it like Harry did . did . 
" I have a few . " He must have obtained some good quality poison from the Aragog , he thought , and gave Slughorn a silly smile as he walked down the hole and said , Slowly , with a majestic voice , " Bye , Aragog , the king of spiders , a loyal friend that we will not forget . 
Though your corpse is corroded , your soul remains on the quiet spider webs in the forest , your home . 
And your children will live well and your friends will find comfort in their loss . "" Fine is beautiful . " Hagrid jerked , he groaned to the dungeon and cried louder than ever . " Here , here , " Slughorn said , waving his wand to the huge pile of earth that rose high and fell to the ground , Up on the dead spider , forming a smooth grave . 
" Come in and have a drink . Come on up here . " They put Hagrid on the chair by the table . 
Fang , who had been hiding in the basket during the burial process , now gently reached them and thrust his head in Harry's heart as he usually did , slugging open the wine he carried . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 23 Horcruxes 
Harry could feel the Lucky Pepper dying as he sneaked back into the castle . 
The front door was unlocked , but on the third floor , Harry encountered the Peeves and was unaware of it , prompting him to slip into a nearby shortcut . 
When it came to Mrs. Beo's portrait , removing her Invisibility Cloak , it was not surprising that Mrs. Beo was very upset . Know what time it does not call the door ? I am sorry . 
You have to go out for something important Password has changed at midnight , you have difficulty sleeping in the hallway offline . Are you kidding ? 
Why change your password at midnight ? That's the order , Ms . Beo replied . If you do not agree then go complain to the principal . 
He gave orders to tighten security but nobody . Actually , Harry looked bitterly at the hard rock floor . Very good ! 
If I had Dumbledore here , I would go , because he wanted Professor Dumbledore to come back . A voice rang behind Harry . He came back to school one hour ago . Nick Sneak heads to Harry , the head swaying on the folded shirt . I hear the Nam drenched Bloody said so . 
He returned , looking a bit tired but happy . Where is he ? Harry asked , his heart pounding . It was moaning and smashing things on the Tower of Heaven . That's his favorite game I'm not saying Barbaric , I mean Dumbledore . Oh , he's in the office . 
With what the bloody Baron said , I think the principal had something to do before going to sleep . Of course , Harry replied , incredibly excited to think of Dumbledore telling him of his memory . Slughorn . 
He turned around and ran at full speed , leaving Mrs. Beow behind her back . Come back ! 
Hey , I'm lying ! 
I'm mad at you for waking me up ! 
The password is still ' tapeworm ' ! But Harry ran down the hallway and a few minutes later , stopped in front of Dumbledore's tentacle . 
When it says toffee eclairs , the gutters leap aside , allowing Harry to enter the twisted staircase . Come on , Dumbledore said as Harry knocked on the door . 
Sounds tired . 
Harry pushed the door open . 
Dumbledore's office was always the same , the only other was the black sky outside the window . Heaven and earth , Harry ? Dumbledore was surprised . How are you pleased to meet you at this late hour ? Teacher , I got it . 
You've got Slughorn's memory ! 
Harry took the small glass bottle and handed it to Dumbledore . 
The headmaster was astonished . 
Then his face flashed a bright smile . Harry , this is scary . 
Very good . 
You always believe that you can do it . It seemed to be forgotten that it was too late , he hurried out of the table , using his unpowered hand to pick up the bottle of memory of Slughorn , then strode to the signboard . And now , Dumbledore put the stone pot on the table , slipping off the bottle . Now we will know . 
Hurry up , Harry obediently bent to the sign and felt his feet leave the floor . Again it fell into the dark and landed in Horace Slughorn's office years ago . 
Slughorn looked much younger now , with thick , straw - blond hair and golden mustache . 
He was sitting comfortably on the couch , his feet on the velvet carpet , one hand holding a small glass of wine , and the other in the pineapple box . 
And about half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn , Tom Riddle sitting in the middle of the crowd , Marvolo's gold - and - black ring glittering in his hands . 
Dumbledore landed next to Harry just as Riddle asked , Teacher , is it true Professor Merrythought will retire ? Tom , Tom , if I knew I would not tell you , Slughorn waved his fingers at Riddle in rebuke , but at the same time winked . He wanted to know where I got this information . 
You know more than half the teachers here , boy . Riddle smiled , the boys laughed and looked at him with admiration . You have the strange ability to know the things you should not know , plus the smart stuff people need - thank you for the pineapple box , which is what I like . 
In this case , I think 20 years later , I will become Minister of Magic . 
No , 15 years if you keep trying to send pineapple for us , we know many people in the Ministry of Magic . Tom Riddle just smiled as the boys burst out laughing again . 
Harry noticed that even though Riddle was not the eldest of the group , the children seemed to regard him as a great hero . I do not know whether you are fit for politics , teacher , he said when the laughter was off . The first is that the child does not have proper descent . Some boys smiled at each other . 
Harry daresay that they are laughing at what they know , or think they know , about their great ancestor . Nonsense , Slughorn said quickly , of course , came from a family of witches . 
You talented like that ! 
Oh , I will go far . 
I never mistook a student at all . The little gold watch on Slughorn's desk was at 11 o ' clock , and he looked around . Oh , it's time . 
You should go to bed trouble . 
Lestrange , I want you to submit your essay tomorrow , otherwise you will be banned . 
Me too , Avery . One by one leave the room . 
Slughorn stretched out of the armchair and placed the empty wine on the table . 
There was a voice behind him making him back : Riddle was standing there . Hurry up Tom , I do not want to get caught up in sleep . 
Remember you are the master . Teacher , I want to ask you a few things . Just ask , sweetheart , just go and tell me , do you know anything about Horcrux ? Slughorn stared at the Riddle , his fingers clenching involuntarily for a glass of wine . 
Is this a Black Hawk Prevention topic ? But Harry could tell Slughorn that it was not a class assignment . Not really , Riddle replied . I found this word while reading books and I do not really understand . No ? 
Have not you found a book at Hogwarts to tell me about the Horcrux , Tom ? that is dark , very bad . But you know everything about them , right ? I mean , a wizard like you - sorry , I mean if you do not know , who knows ? - so perfect , Harry thought , this pause , This , and a little flattering , all just enough . 
Harry had so much experience in getting information from people who were not willing to talk , so he had to admit that Riddle was a master . 
Apparently Riddle craved what Slughorn knew , and may have been preparing for this moment for weeks . 
Slughorn did not look at Riddle , his hand on the ribbon on pineapple box cover . Actually , it would not hurt to let me know . 
Just let me know more about this term . ' Horcrux ' is something that people use to hide a part of their soul into it . I do not know how to do it , Riddle said . 
His voice was compressed , but he was obviously agitated . That is , we can separate our souls , and hide a part of our soul from something outside our body . 
If one does so , whether the body is attacked or destroyed , he can not die , because part of his soul remains in the physical world and is not disturbed . 
But of course , in such a way , Slughorn's face shrank . 
Harry suddenly remembered the words he heard about two years ago : I was torn from my body , I lost the ghost , lost the worst ghost But I still live . Nobody wants to survive that way , Tom . 
Better to die than to die . But Riddle's lust was becoming increasingly apparent , and he could not hide his greed . How to divide your soul ? Slughorn was very reluctant . You must understand that the soul needs to be kept intact . 
Breaking it down is the opposite of creativity . But how ? By committing a crime . 
The most terrible crime . 
By killing people . 
When murdered , the soul of the offender will be torn . 
Any witch who destined to create a Horcrux will take advantage of that . 
He will box the torn souls . canned 
How ? By some magic . Do not ask me , I do not know . Slughorn shook his head like an old elephant disturbed by mosquitoes . Do we look like murderers to box our souls ? Of course not , Teacher , Riddle answered quickly . I'm sorry , I do not mean to offend . It's okay , Slughorn hoarse . Curious about those things is easy to understand . 
Mages who have reached a certain level are always attracted to such issues . 
But I still do not understand - of course I'm just curious - Is a Horcrux enough ? 
Is not it better to be stronger if we separate our souls into many parts ? 
Seven parts , for example . 
No . 7 is the most magical , most powerful , is not it ? Swear by Merlin's beard , Slughorn exclaimed . These seven ! 
To think of killing a person is not enough sin ? 
Divide the soul , whatever the cause , also 
That's a lot of bad news , and then divided into 7 slughorn pieces that look worrying now . 
He stared at Riddle like regret for answering him . Of course , Slughorn muttered . What we're talking about is just a hypothesis . It's a story , is not it ? Yes , Riddle replied . But this Tom , no matter what , do not open to anyone what you just said , that is , what teachers have just discussed . 
Everyone knows it is not good . 
The Horcrux is banned at Hogwarts , you know that Dumbledore is very strict about this . I will not say a word , sir . Riddle said and walked away , but Harry caught a glimpse of him in the air as if for the first time he knew he was a witch . 
That joy did not make Riddle look more handsome , but on the contrary , making the lines on his face seem to lack humanity . Thank you , Harry . Dumbledore whispered . Let's go . When Harry landed in the principal's office , he was sitting behind his desk . 
Harry also sat down , silently waiting . You've been waiting for this proof for so long , Dumbledore finally spoke . He confirmed his hypothesis was true , and also showed that we had too much to do . Harry noticed that suddenly the old principals in the wall portraits woke up and listened to the conversation . 
A fat red nose magician even pulled out a deaf earphone . Harry , I'm sure you understand the importance of what we have just heard . 
Just about the same age as now that Tom Riddle dared to do everything to be able to become immortal . Do you think he succeeded ? Harry asked . Did he make a Horcrux ? 
So he did not die when attacking me ? 
He hid Horcrux somewhere ? 
Part of his soul is still intact ? More than one . 
I heard Voldemort say , he would like to know Horace's opinion about what might happen if he created more than one Horcrux , what could happen to a witch so deadly that he would kill Many times , I dare to tear my soul into pieces and hide them in the different Horcrux . 
No books tell him that . 
As you know , that teacher sure Voldemort knows , no witch dare to tear his soul into more than two pieces . Dumbledore paused for a moment , rearranged his lines of thought and continued . Four years ago , he received one of the strong evidence that Voldemort had broken his soul . Where ? 
How ? Asked Harry . You gave it to me , Harry . 
Riddle's diary , with instructions on how to open the secret room . Teacher , I do not understand . Although he did not watch Riddle step out of the diary , what he told me was not the same as anything he had seen before . 
Only one memory can think and act on its own ? 
Just a memory that can suck up the vitality of the little girl holding the diary ? 
No , there must be something else , more dangerous than hiding in that piece of soul , he was so sure . 
The diary must be a Horcrux . 
But more questions arise . What you want to know most and also most concern , is the diary does not seem to protect the soul . 
It is also used as a weapon . 
I still do not understand . The diary has the function of a Horcrux , meaning it protects the soul hidden inside it and helps its owner avoid death . 
But at the same time Riddle wanted others to read the diary , want his soul to enter or take another body to be able to remove the cage for the Slytherin monster again . Clearly he did not want his efforts wasted . Said Harry . He wanted everyone to know he was Slytherin's heir , because he could not reveal it at that time . Exactly , Dumbledore nodded . But if he was going to pass on the diary to a future Hogwarts student , could he possibly be indifferent to the precious piece of soul hidden in it ? 
As Professor Slughorn explained , the purpose of Horcrux is to keep a certain part of the soul safe , rather than to throw it away , and then risk being destroyed . 
And indeed , that has happened . 
Piece of soul is no longer . 
I've dealt with that , Harry . It is Voldemort's carelessness to use this Horcrux to make him worry . 
He must have made , or planned to make more Horcrux , so that if he loses the first Horcrux , it is not that bad . 
You do not want to believe this , but there is no better explanation . And then two years later , I told him that on the night Voldemort returned to his body , he declared the most frightening , most obvious to the Death Eaters : Who on the road to immortality . ' Beyond anyone ' - Death Eaters may not understand , but I understand what he wants to say . 
He talks about Horcruxes , HORRORs , Harry , which I believe no witch has ever done so . 
But everything fits together : Lord Voldemort is losing more and more humanity than ever . 
That change can only be explained by the fact that his soul has been cut far beyond the level of what is commonly referred to as ' common sin ' . So he killed another person so that no one could kill him ? Asked Harry . Why did not he make a Witch Stone or steal it if he craved for immortality ? Oh , we all know he tried that five years ago . 
But there are several reasons that I believe that the Stone of the Voldemort is not attractive to the Lord of Horcrux . 
While Triclosan can prolong life , but if you want to be immortal , drink it often . 
Therefore , Voldemort will have to depend entirely on the Antibiotic . 
Assuming that the drug is gone or poisoned , or if the Sorcerer's Stone is stolen , he will die as normal . 
Remember Voldemort likes to act alone . 
He thought he could not stand it if he felt depressed , depending on his lifespan . 
Of course , Voldemort is ready to take medicine if it helps him escape the horrible life that he suffered after attacking him . 
But only to have a body again . 
Later , I believe he continues to rely on the Horcrux . 
He did not need anything more after recovering the figure . 
Voldemort is ready to be immortal , you see , closer to immortality than anyone else . 
But now , Harry , get this information , a very important information , we are also closer to the possibility of killing Voldemort than anyone . 
You hear him say : Is it better to be stronger if we separate our souls into many parts ? No . 7 is the most magical , most powerful number . Great appeal to Lord Voldemort . He made up to 7 Horcrux ? Harry asked , stunned , while the wall portraits were both dumbfounded and outraged . These Horcrux can stay 
Any place in the world , hidden , buried , invisible , I'm glad you realized the severity of the problem . Dumbledore replied calmly . But first of all , there are not 7 , but only 6 Horcruxes . 
The seventh soul , despite being severely torn , must also be in Voldemort's newly created body . 
It is this spirit of Voldemort who has been pretending to be ghosts for years , without this soul is without him . This will be the last piece of soul that must be destroyed if you want to kill Voldemort , this piece is in his body . But how did the remaining 6 Horcrux find them ? I forgot , I destroyed one . 
You kill another one . So ? Asked Harry excitedly . That's right , Harry , Dumbledore said and held his hand as black as burned out . It is Marvolo's ring . 
A terrible curse is embedded in it . 
Sorry if you show a little humility , but if not for the extraordinary ability of the teacher , plus the timely help of Professor Snape when he reached Hogwarts serious injury , he probably I do not live to tell this story . 
Now the ring is no longer a Horcrux . But how did you find it ? Now that you know , I'm very interested in exploring Voldemort's past . 
He went to many places , visiting places Voldemort knew . 
He happened to find the ring hidden in the ruins of the Gaunt . 
Once Voldemort had attached a soul to the inside of the ring , he probably did not want to wear it . 
He protected it with powerful magic , hiding it in the ancestral hut he had lived ( of course , Morfin was put into Azkaban jail ) . But he could not have imagined that one day , into the rubble and look for things hidden by magic . 
But we should not praise ourselves too much . 
I canceled the diary , I canceled the ring , but if the seven souls were supposed to be correct , there are still 4 Horcruxes . And they can be anything , are not they ? 
It could be canned goods , empty bottles . I was thinking of the Harbor , Harry , the trivial item that nobody paid attention to . 
But could Lord Voldemort use canned cans with old bottles to preserve his precious soul ? 
I forgot what you showed me . 
Lord Voldemort likes to collect achievements , and especially likes things with powerful magical backgrounds . 
He is proud , he believes in the superiority of himself , he resolves to put his name in the most prominent position in the history of magic . That makes him believe Voldemort must be very careful when choosing objects used Horcrux , And things seem noble . The diary is so special . The diary , as you have said , is proof that he is the heir of Slytherin . 
With Voldemort it is of extraordinary importance . 
What about the other Horcruxes ? 
Do you know what they are ? You can only guess . 
Based on the reasons given , he thinks Voldemort will choose the things that have been noble in themselves . 
So he revisited Voldemort's past to see if anything had disappeared in the places where he had appeared . Hufflepuff's trophy ! Shouted Harry . And the pendant ! Yes . Dumbledore smiled . He is willing to bet , not a good hand , but only a few fingers , that is the third and fourth Horcrux . 
If Voldemort had created 6 horcruxes , the other two would be more difficult to guess , but he would have tried it too . 
After acquiring two relics from Hufflepuff and Slytherin , he will search for items belonging to Gryffindor and Ravenclaw . 
Four of the four founders of Hogwarts would have been fascinated by Voldemort's imagination . 
He does not know if he's got anything from Ravenclaw , but Gryffindor's only known remains are safe . Dumbledore pointed his black finger to the back wall , where the glazed sword was still dormant in the glass envelope . Is it because he wants to return to Hogwarts ? to find some items of school founders ? Thinking of it exactly , Harry , but it did not help us to go any further , because Voldemort had to leave without having the opportunity to rummage through the school . 
He was forced to conclude that he had not yet completed the dream of collecting all the relics of the four founders . 
He certainly has two things - maybe 3 - that's all we know . If he gets something from Ravenclaw or Gryffindor , there's still a sixth Horcrux . Said Harry , counting . Unless he has enough relics of both of them . I do not think so . Perhaps you know what the Sixth Horcrux is . 
What would you say if you told me you were curious about Nagini's snake behavior ? Snake ? Harry was startled . How can animals be used to make Horcrux ? To do so is not wise , because giving up a part of your soul to something that can be thought of and moved is extremely risky . 
However , if he correctly calculates , when Voldemort enters his parents ' house to kill his son , he has not created the last Horcrux in the set of 6 . 
It seems he wants to make Horcrux out of the particularly important deaths , which is one of them . 
He believes that by killing him , the danger of the prophecy will disappear , he will become champion . 
He was supposed to make the last Horcrux from his death . 
And then he failed . 
However , after several years of absence , he used the Nagini serpent to kill an old Muggle . 
Then maybe he made Nagini the last Horcrux . 
The snake is associated with Slytherin , which further increases the mystery of Lord Voldemort . 
He loved the serpent as well as the other . 
Apparently he likes to keep it close to him , and control it more than a regular Xà Khẩu does . So , Harry said , the diary and the ring were destroyed . 
The gold pendant , the trophy and the snake remained intact . 
And do you think maybe the sixth Horcrux is a relic of Ravenclaw or Gryffindor ? An accurate summary is very admirable . Dumbledore said and leaned over . Are you still looking for them ? 
Are you looking for them every time you leave school ? Yes . 
I have been searching for a long time . 
I thought maybe I was going to find another Horcrux . 
There are many good signs . If you find one , Harry said quickly , can you come along to help me destroy it ? Dumbledore stared at Harry for a moment before answering , he thought . Really ? Harry asked again , not believing his ears . Really , Dumbledore laughed . I think you have that right . Harry was relieved . 
How good it is not to listen to the reminder of careful care anymore . 
But the principals around the wall did not seem to be impressed by Dumbledore's decision . 
Harry saw some shaking his head . 
Phineas Nigellus even snorted loudly . Does Voldemort know when Horcrux is destroyed , Teacher ? 
Does he feel it ? Harry asked , ignoring the witches in the picture . 
Good question Harry . 
I do not think so . 
As Voldemort was more and more immersed in evil , when the pieces of that soul were cut off from him for so long , he did not feel like ordinary people anymore . 
Maybe when death comes , he will realize that he did not even know that the diary was destroyed until he forced Lucius Malfoy to tell the truth . 
Upon discovering that the book had been destroyed and lost its strength , he learned that Voldemort was in a rage . But do you think he wants Lucius Malfoy to get him into Hogwarts ? Yes , Voldemort had wanted so many years ago , when he was certain he could create new Horcruxes . 
Lucius had to wait for him , but soon after he gave Lucius his diary , he disappeared . 
Voldemort would think that Lucius was so fearful of his master that he would not dare to do anything else than to keep the book intact . 
But he was wrong . 
He disappeared for a long time and Lucius thought his master was dead . 
Besides , Lucius does not know what the book really is . 
Perhaps Voldemort just told Lucius that the diary could help open the Chamber of Secrets because it was cleverly manipulated . 
If Lucius knew he was holding a master's soul , he would have honored the book . 
Instead , he set up another plan to achieve his own goal . 
By pushing the diaries for the daughter of Arthur Weasley , he hopes to make Arthur discreditable , and just shoved the magical items that made him easy to catch . 
Oh dear Lucius After learning that Lucius dared to throw away the Horcrux for his own sake , plus the tragedy of the Magic Gear last year , Voldemort was mad . 
He is not surprised if Lucius is now more likely to be safe in the Azkaban dungeon . Harry thought for a moment and then : So if all the Horcrux were destroyed , could I kill Voldemort ? Yes , I think . 
Without these Horcruxes , Voldemort would be just a normal human with a crippled soul . 
However , you should remember that even though his soul is so damaged that it can not be restored , his magical powers and intelligence remain intact . 
It takes extra strength and skill to destroy a Voldemort - sized witch , even if he loses Horcrux . But you have extraordinary power . Harry was not able to speak . 
Are you , Dumbledore answered yes . I have the strength that Voldemort never had . 
You may know me , Harry is impatient . I can love . It's hard to refrain from adding a sentence . Dumbledore was like reading what Harry was trying to say . 
Yes , Harry , I know love . 
And that , expressed through what has happened to me , is great . 
I'm still too young to understand how unusual Harry is . So , when the prophecy says that you have a power that the Dark Lord does not know , it's just love ? Harrry was a bit disappointed . Yes , it is love . 
But Harry , remember that prophecy is only important when Vincent makes it important . 
Late last year he told me this . 
Voldemort considered me the most dangerous person , and in that way , he made me really the most scary of him . What is so different ? Dumbledore began to lose patience . 
And with dry black fingers to Harry , he said , I have too much respect for what the prophecy says . But , Harry faltered , he said that the prophecy meant that if Voldemort could not hear the prophecy , would it have been done ? Is there any value ? Of course not ! 
Do you think all the prophecies in the Prophet's office are all happening ? But , Harry was really bewildered , he said last year that he and Voldemort would have to kill each other . Harry , Harry , it was because Voldemort made a serious mistake : he acted according to what Professor Trelawney said ! 
If Voldemort did not kill his father , did he sow in me with such a vengeful desire for revenge ? 
No . of course . 
If he did not cause her mother to die to protect her , would he give her protection that he could not penetrate ? 
Oh Harry ! 
Do not you understand ? 
Like every tyrant in the world , Voldemort has created himself the most feared enemy . 
Do you know that every tyrant is afraid of the people they oppress ? All of them knew that one day , in the victims , one would stand up against them . 
Voldemort is the same . 
He is constantly looking for someone who can challenge his power . 
He heard the prophecy and hurried to act . 
As a result , he has chosen the one who can kill him , and gives him that unique weapon ! But most importantly you must understand this ! said Dumbledore , standing up and striding around the room , his sparkling robe clattering . 
Harry never felt so moved . By trying to kill his son , Voldemort creates the man sitting in front of me , and gives him the power to finish his career . 
It was through Voldemort's mistake that I could see his thoughts , his ambitions , and I could understand his snake's sound . 
However , Harry , even if you can infiltrate Voldemort's world - that's a special ability the Death Eater has always wanted to die for - but I've never been fascinated by the Dark side . 
I never expressed any wish even the smallest , is to join the team of Voldemort ! Of course you can not ! Harry replied indignantly . He killed my parents ! In short , the child is protected , thanks to the ability to know love ! Dumbledore's voice was loud . This is the only layer of protection that works well against the allure of Dark Power ! 
Despite all the temptations I have experienced , my heart is still as clean as my eleventh year , when I look at the mirror reflecting my hidden aspirations . 
And the mirror shows me the only way to defeat Lord Voldemort , not to show the desire to be immortal or wealthy . 
Harry , do you know that not many witches can see what I saw in the mirror ? 
Voldemort should have known what he was facing , but he did not know ! 
Now he knew . 
You can get into Voldemort's mind and still be safe , otherwise he can not have children without the terrible pain , as he saw in the Ministry of Magic . 
You think he can not understand why , Harry . 
Because when he hurried to cut his soul , Voldemort did not stop to understand the incomparable strength of a pure soul . But teacher , Harry said , trying to be calm , in the end the results are still the same , right ? 
Will you have to kill him , or MUST ? 
Of course you have to . 
But not by the prophecy proclaimed . This is because you , myself , will never feel safe if you do not act ! 
We both know that ! 
Imagine , if you have never heard of prophecy , how do you feel about Voldemort ? 
Think about it ! Harry looked at Dumbledore and walked over in front of him , thinking quietly . 
He thought about his mother , his father , Sirius . 
He thinks of Cedric Diggory . to the horrible crimes that Voldemort had done . 
A flame burns in his chest , making him dry his throat . I want him to die ! Said Harry quietly . 
And you want to kill yourself . That's right . 
See , prophecy does not mean you have to do anything ! 
But it made Lord Voldemort look like a peer to the lord . In other words , you are free to choose your own path , or even to turn away from prophecy ! 
But Voldemort still values ​​ the prophecy . 
He will continue to chase the child inevitably , leading to one of the two having to end his life , said Harry . right . Finally he understood what Dumbledore was trying to explain . 
Harry thought , he had to go to the arena to face death completely different from when he raised his head to the fight . 
Someone will say that the two are no different , but Dumbledore knows , and Harry thinks with a boiling pride , I know , just as your parents have known , that this is the biggest difference . in this world ! 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 24 SECTUMSEMPRA 
Exhausted but excited about work last night , Harry tells everything that has happened to Hermione and Ron in the High School classroom ( Harry has not forgotten the Muffiato charm to keep people around . Both of them were impressed and pleased with the way Harry used to get Professor Slughorn's memory , and was also extremely scared when Harry talked about Voldemort's Horcruxes and Professor Dumbledore's promise . Will bring Harry along when he finds the Horcruxes . Wow , Ron exclaimed as Harry finished his story , not realizing that he was waving his wandlessly toward the ceiling . Wow , you really will be with Professor Dumbledore trying to destroy Wow ! Ron , you're making snow , Hermione said gently , pulling Ron's wrist and turning his wand off the ceiling , where a snowball was beginning to fall . 
Harry noticed Lavender Brown glaring at Hermione from the table beside her red eyes . 
Hermione let go of Ron's hand immediately . Oh as Ron looked down at his shoulders in astonishment . Sorry it looked as if we were full of buckwheat Lavender cried as Ron brushed the fake snow on Hermione's shoulder . 
Looks wrong , Ron turned his back to her . We broke up last night , Ron said quietly to Harry . When she caught us coming out of the dorm room . 
Obviously , she can not see you under the invisibility cloak , so it's only Hermione and me together . Well , but you're not sorry when it's over , right ? Asked Harry . Absolutely not , Ron admitted . It was terrible when she screamed but at least I did not have to stand to finish things . Cowards , Hermione sarcastically though she looked amused . Last night was not a good night for the romantic stories around . 
Harry , Ginny and Dean also broke up last night . Harry felt Hermione's gaze hiding something but he still believed that she certainly could not know his heart suddenly danced inside . 
Trying not to reveal a strange face and voice , Harry asked : Why ? Well , that's a pretty funny reason . Ginny says that Dean is always trying to get her to climb up Mrs. Bard's hole , as if she can not get in on herself , but they are not going well for so long . 
Harry glances to the other side of the class , Dean looks unhappy . Obviously this will put you in a very awkward state , right ? Asked Hermione . What do you mean ? Harry hurried back . Quidditch team , Hermione replied . If Ginny and Dean do not talk to each other , right ? Said Harry . Flitwick . Ron warned . 
The small enchanted professor was heading toward them , and Hermione was the only one in the group who could turn vinegar into wine . 
Her glass was filled with red liquid , while Harry and Ron's liquids were still dark brown . Hey , boys , Professor Flitwick hissed at the shrieks in a reproachful manner . Talk a little and practice a lot to try to make me see . Both raised their wands and focused their attention on the jar . 
Harry's vinegar freezes while Ron's jar explodes . Okay , homework is rehearsal . Professor Flitwick said as he emerged from beneath the table and took the debris from the top of the hat . 
The three of them had a rare pause after the Spell so they went to the common room . 
Ron seems to feel comfortable after the relationship between him and Lavender ends . 
Hermione looked cheerful , though , when she was asked what she was smiling at , she replied simply : Today was a beautiful day . Neither of them seemed to notice the fierce battle that was going on in Harry's mind : She was Ron's sister . 
But she left Dean . 
She's still Ron's sister . 
I'm his best friend . That makes things even worse . 
If I told Ron before - He would beat you . 
What if I do not mind ? 
He is your best friend . 
Harry just realized that the three of them were climbing into the sun - kissed common room of Mrs. Be's portrays , and absentmindedly glanced at a group of seventh - year students clambering in there , until they heard Hermione scream . : Katie ! 
Are you back ? 
Are you okay ? Harry stared : It was Katie Bell , who looked healthy and surrounded by her delighted friends . I'm fine ! She responded cheerfully . They allowed me to leave the hospital Monday , stayed at home with my parents for a few days and returned to school this morning . 
Leanne just told me about McLaggen and the match , Harry Right , Harry replied , Oh , you came back and Ron was fine , we ' ll have a good chance to beat Ravenclaw , that is still have the opportunity to win the trophy . 
Listen this Katie Harry needs to ask her right away . 
Curiosity temporarily pushes Ginny aside in Harry's mind . 
While Katie's friends are picking things up because they are late for the Transcript , Harry asks quietly , " Who in the necklace do you remember who gave you ? No , Katie answered , shaking her head sadly . Everyone was asking me about it , but I did not have a clue whatsoever . The last thing I can remember is that I was walking into the ladies ' toilet at the Three Broom . Then I'm sure I was in the toilet ? Hermione interrupted . 
Oh , I know I pushed the door open . Katie answered . So I think the person who used the charm must be right behind the door . 
The story then completely oblivious to what happened two weeks ago at St . Mungo Hospital . 
Listen , I have to go . 
I do not want Professor McGonagall to give up today is my first day back at Katie's school with her books and bags and chasing after my friends to wear Harry , Ron and Hermione sit at the table in the window . , thoughtfully thinking about what she said . Then it must be a girl or woman who gave Katie the necklace , Hermione said , to be able to enter the female toilet . Or someone looking like a girl or a woman , Harry responds . Do not forget that there is a cauldron of Polyjuice Potion in Hogwarts . 
We know a little has been stolen . In Harry's mind , Crabbes and Goyles are in the shape of a girl . I thought I would take a few drops of Felix and go back to the Need Room again . Said Harry . That would be a waste . Hermione said emphatically and put the Spellman syllable just taken out of the bag . Fortunately , he can only help you in his testimony . 
Slughorn's case is not like this , he always has the ability to persuade him , just grasp the right moment . 
Fortunately not enough to help him break the strong spell . Do not waste the rest of the medicine , you will need all the luck you can have when Professor Dumbledore brings you along with her . Can not we make more ? Ron asked Harry , ignoring Hermione . It would be great if there was a stockpile available . Harry pulls out the luxury drug out of his pocket and finds Felix Felicis . Oh , extremely confusing , Harry answered while glancing through the ingredients list . 
And it took six months to complete the tunnel . Said Ron . 
Just ready to put the book aside , Harry suddenly saw the corner marked and turned over . That is the word Sectumsempra , the comment : for the enemy , which Harry marked a few weeks ago . 
In large part because of not wanting to see Hermione , Harry has not found the effect of the note and told himself to try on McLaggen as he approached him without being aware of it . ( This place is not sure because both of them use him , do not know who she is behind anyone ? ) ? The only one who is particularly unhappy about Katie's return is Dean Thomas knowing that he No longer needed to fill Katie's place on the Quidditch team . 
When Harry informed Dean about it , he was only a little grumpy and shrugged , accepting Harry's decision coldly . 
But Harry felt strongly that he and Seamus whispered something in his back . The next night was the best rehearsal since Harry's captaincy . 
The team was extremely pleased to be free of McLaggen and to have Katie in the squad so well that they all flew so well . 
Ginny does not seem to be upset about breaking up with Dean , on the contrary , she is the soul and vitality of the team . 
Ginny replayed Ron's dismay at the goal , and the scene was overrun by McLaggen before being knocked unconscious , making everyone very happy . 
Harry also joined in laughing at everyone and was not happy to have a good reason to look at Ginny . 
During the training session , Harry received more injuries from the Bludger because of not being able to find the Snitch . 
The battle between Ron and Ginny still takes place in Harry's mind . Sometimes he would tell Ron , after the incident with the lavender , would not mind if Harry dating Ginny , but then Ron's reaction when his sister and Dean kissed appear before Harry , making him believe . Just holding Ginny's hand was enough for Ron to think it was a mean betrayal . 
However , Harry could not stop chatting with Ginny , laughed at her , and returned after practicing ; Despite his conscience , Harry realized he was looking for the best way to go with Ginny . 
Assuming that Slughorn held a small party like before , it was convenient , because Ron would not be there . 
Unfortunately , Slughorn seems to have abandoned them . 
There were times when Harry thought of Hermione's help , but thought he could not stand Hermione's smug look that Harry felt whenever she caught him gazing at Ginny or laughing at him . Her joke . 
As if all was not enough trouble , Harry was also upset that if I did not talk to Ginny soon , there would be someone ahead of him , as both Ron and Harry had to admit that Ginny himself Very famous in school . 
In short , the intention to use Felix Felicis grows stronger in Harry , this is the case , as Hermion says , Harry needs a good time . 
Gently warm days passed , and Ron was always there when Harry met Ginny . 
Harry saw himself as wishing something of a magical fortune that made Ron realize that there was nothing more wonderful than his best friend and sister to have feelings for each other , and to give them a little bit of privacy . Even just a few seconds . 
It seemed as if those two wishes had no way of making it as the Quidditch final drew nearer , making Ron always ardently discussing tactics with Harry and not minding anything else . 
Ron is not the only one who cares about this but the excitement is spreading throughout the school as this is the decisive match for this year's trophy . 
If Gryffindor wins Ravenclaw with a disparity score of 300 points ( a pretty high goal , and Harry has never seen his team fly better ) , Gryffindor will be headed . 
Although Gryffindor wins , less than 300 points will be second to Ravenclaw . 
In the case of Harry's team losing 100 points , Gryffindor would be third and fourth if losing more than 100 points . 
Harry is convinced that no one will let Harry forget himself as the first captain in two centuries to bring Gryffindor to the table if that happens . 
The battle in this decisive battle has all the usual features : members of two rivals try to intimidate opponents in the corridor ; Funny songs about each member of the team are rehearsed loudly as they pass by . 
The Quidditch players do not go wild and enjoy the attention , they also go to the toilet to vomit . 
Somehow , the outcome of the game became inseparable from the success or failure of Ginny's plan in Harry's mind . 
Believing that if Gryffindor could win with more than 300 points , the happy scene and a bustling party after the game would suffice to replace Felix Felicis . 
In the midst of such worries , Harry did not forget the desire to find out what Malfoy was plotting in the Room of Need . 
Regularly reviewing the map of the hijackers and finding no Malfoy ever , Harry guessed that he was spending a lot of time in that room . 
Although there is no hope of breaking in , Harry tries again to try again , but no matter how much Harry has rearranged or changed the request in his mind , the door still does not appear . . 
A few days before the final with Ravenclaw , Harry went down to the dining room alone from the common room , while Ron rushed to the toilet to vomit again , and Hermione rushed to find Vector Professor for a mistake . She claims to have committed herself in the Arithmancy essay . 
By habit , Harry walks along the 7 th floor corridor while looking at the map of the hackers . 
At first , Harry could not find Malfoy on the map , so he was in the Room of Requirement . 
But then Malfoy's name appears with a dot in the lower level male toilet , but neither Crabbes nor Goyle are nearby , but the ghost is crying for Myrtle . 
Harry kept staring at those dots until he hit a suit of armor . awakened from his dream by the crash and unwilling to be caught by Flitch , Harry rushes down the stone stairs , into the corridor below . 
Outside the men's toilet , Harry pressed his ear against the door but could not hear . 
In a gentle way , Harry pushed open the door . 
Draco Malfoy was standing there , his back to the door , his hands clutching the sides of the sink , his head platinum bent . No , my cry crying Myrtle suddenly rang from a corner in the dressing room . Do not tell Myrtle what's going on . Myrtle can help you . No one can help me , Malfoy answered , shivering . I can not do it I can not all fail but if I do not make it soon he will say he will kill me Harry realizes that , with a big shock , he stood on one foot when he saw Malfoy crying But the tears flowed down his pale face and fell to the dusty sink . 
Malfoy sniffed , and then shivered , looking up at the broken mirror on the wall and saw Harry in the back , staring at him . 
Malfoy goes back , pulls his wand away , and Harry retrieves his magic wand . 
Malfoy's curse slipped through Harry a few inches away , breaking the wall lamp beside him . 
Harry jumps aside , lifts his wand and thinks of Levicorpus , but Malfoy stops the note and holds up his wand for another curse . Are not ! 
Are not ! 
Stop ! Myrtle screamed in the pale room . Stop ! 
Stop ! A loud thump and the barrel behind Harry exploded ; Harry tried to lock the foot and fire the wall behind Malfoy and smash the bottom of Myrtle , screaming loudly ; Water spilled over , Harry slipped down when Malfoy grimaced crying at Cruci - Sectumsempra ! On the floor , Harry waved his wand wildly . 
Blood sprayed from Malfoy's face and chest as if he had been hit by an invisible sword . 
Malfoy staggered backwards and fell heavily on the sodden floor , his magic wand falling from his arm with no energy left . No , " Harry blurted . 
Slipping and groggy , Harry stood up and rushed to Malfoy lying there with his bloody face and pale hands clawing at his bloody chest . No - I do not - Harry did not know what he was saying , kneeling next to Malfoy shaking uncontrollably in his bloody minefield . 
Ghost crying Myrtle screamed loudly : kill people ! 
Murder in the toilet . 
Killing ! The door opened behind Harry , who looked up into horror as he saw Snape enter the room with a pale face . Hurrying Harry aside , he knelt down to Malfoy , using his wand to trace the terrible wound he had caused , mumbling a spell that sounded like a song . 
Blood flow seemed to slow , Snape wiped the rest from Malfoy's face and repeated his note . 
At this point , the bruises seem to be coming back . 
Harry stood there in shock about what he had done , vaguely realizing that he himself was also soaked with blood and water . 
Ghost crying Myrtle is still sobbing and groaning on everyone's head . 
As Snape completed his third note , he lifted Malfoy slightly . You need to go to the clinic right now . 
It may leave quite a bit of scarring , but if it is used immediately , it can stop it . He helps Malfoy get out of the toilet , and stops at the door , returning to coldly saying to Harry . , angry : You , Potter wait for me here . Harry had no intention of objecting , stood up slowly , trembling , and gazed at the drenched floor . 
Bloodstains drifted like red flowers . 
Harry did not even think of telling the crying Myrtle cry as Myrtle continued to cry and moan , apparently becoming more and more amused . 
Snape returned after 10 minutes , walked into the toilet and closed the door . Come on , he told Myrtle , and the maid dashed down the toilet immediately to leave the silence behind her . I did not mean it , Harry said right away . 
His voice echoed in the cold and damp space . I did not know the consequences of that comment . But Snape ignored it all . Unfortunately I have underestimated you , Potter , You quietly say , Who taught you dark magic ? 
Who taught you that spell ? You - read the road somewhere Where ? In - a library book , Harry replied . I can not remember the name of the book . Lies , Snape replied . 
Harry's throat became dry . 
You know what he's going to do , which he never stopped . 
The toilet was blurry in front of Harry's eyes , and he tried to stop the thought , but no matter how hard he tried , the half - blood Prince's poison book was half - blooded . 
And then Harry stared at Snape again , in the ruined and steamy room . 
Look at Snape's dark eyes , hoping he will not see what Harry is scared of - - - Bring your partner , Snape gently ordered , and all your books . 
All . 
Bring me here . 
Right away . Knowing that no matter how controversial , Harry turns away and rushes out of the restroom . 
Once out of the corridor , Harry rushed to the Gryffindor Tower . 
Most of the people are going backwards , gaping at him with blood and water , but Harry does not answer any questions . 
Harry was shocked , as if a pet suddenly became wild , not knowing what that prince thought , and copied such a curse in his book ? 
And what will happen when Snape sees the book ? 
Did he tell Slughorn ? - Harry hobbled up - how did you achieve such a good position in the drug class this year ? ! 
Will he confiscate and destroy it ? 
The book taught Harry so many things and became a guide as well as Harry's friend . 
You can not let that happen Can not you Where are you - - ? 
Why are you wet ? 
Blood ? Ron was standing on the top of the stairs , looking shocked at Harry . I need your books , Harry gasped . Your poison books . 
Quickly give it to yourself . But the Prince's book - I ' ll explain after Ron took his senior drug book out of the bag and handed it to Harry ; He took Ron and ran to Ron to the meeting room . There Harry snatched up his briefcase , ignoring the surprised eyes of how many had finished dinner , rushed out through the portrait hole and ran up to the seventh corridor . Harry folded beside the embroidered carpet . The dwarf dancing , closing his eyes and starting slowly . 
I need a place to hide the book . I need a place to hide the book . I need a place to hide the book . Harry walks three times in front of an empty wall . 
Finally he saw it when he opened his eyes : the door to the Room of Need . 
Harry tugged open the door , dashed into the room , and slammed the door behind him . 
Harry gasped . 
Despite the urgency and fear of what was waiting for him at the toilet , Harry could not help but be wary of what he was looking at . 
His room was as big as a cathedral , with large windows glinting down like a city with towering walls built with items that had been hidden by so many generations . people living in Hogwarts . There are paths and trails surrounded by tilting pillars of classified items , perhaps to hide the evidence of misuse , or to be hidden by elves . proud of the castle . 
Thousands of books without any doubt , or banned , or painted , or stolen hidden in the room . 
There are also broken bottles containing frozen drugs , hats , jewelry , robes ; There are even things that look like dragon eggshells , poisonous bottles shining with scary shimmer , no less , swords rustling , and a heavy ax full of blood . 
Harry rushes to one of the paths between the hidden objects . 
Turn right at a huge embroidered picture , run a short walk , and turn left at the empty cupboard that Montague disappeared last year , Harry finally stopped by a cupboard look like acid spilled . to its blister surface . 
He opened one of the creaking doors of the closet : where there was a hiding place for something in the cage and had long since left only a five - foot dry skeleton . 
Harry loaded the Prince's book halfway through the cage and slammed the door . 
For a few seconds , Harry's heart beat violently as he looked up at the mess around . Could he find this place in the ruins ? 
Harry reached for the half - man statue of a witch in a nearby crate and placed it above the cupboard where the book was hidden , he wore a statue of an old , dusty wig , and one The tiara has stained to make it easier to find . 
Hurrying through the old ways as quickly as possible , Harry returned to the door , dashed out , slamming the door behind him . 
Blink the door back to the stone wall . 
Harry ran to the toilet , trying to stuff Ron's bra on his pair . 
A moment later , he was standing in front of Snape's hand reaching for Harry's briefcase without uttering a word . 
Harry gave him , gasping for breath , fear as it burned in his chest , and waited . 
Snape pulls out Harry's book , examining it closely . 
Finally , he gazed intently at the poisoned book before speaking . 
Is this your senior drug book , Potter ? Yes , Harry answered with a short breath . Are you sure , Potter ? Yes , Harry answered with a bit of a challenge . Is this a high - end drug book purchased by Flourish and Blotts ? Right . Harry said firmly . Then , Snape asked , why is the inner cover of the book called ' Roonil Wazlib ' ? Harry's heart stopped beating for a moment . That's my joke . Harry answered . Your joke , Snape repeated . 
Yes , you usually call me joking , Harry replied . I know what the name is , Snape said . His cold black eyes brushed Harry's eyes again ; He tried not to look at those eyes . Shut your mind shut your mind . But you never really learned how to do it . Do you know what I'm thinking , Potter ? Snape said quietly . I think you are a liar , deceiver and deserving of a ban every Saturday until the end of the school year . 
What do you think ? I - I do not agree , Professor , Harry replied , avoiding his eyes . 
All right , we ' ll see how you feel after the ban , Snape replied . Ten o ' clock Saturday morning , Potter . 
At our office . But Professor Harry raised his voice , looking up . Quidditch's last match of the Ten o ' clock , Snape whispered with a smile showing golden teeth . Poor Gryffindor this year , I'm afraid so . And he left the toilet without saying a word , leaving Harry staring at the cracked glass on the wall , feeling worse than Ron's . Harry had been so sure . I will not say ' I told you ' , Hermione said in the meeting room an hour later . Come on , Hermione , Ron said angrily . 
Harry left the dinner because he no longer wanted to eat . 
He told Ron , Hermione , and Ginny what had happened , though not necessary . 
The news spread so quickly : It seemed that the crying ghost Myrtle jumped from any toilet to tell the story ; Malfoy was visited by Pansy Parkinson in the medical room , and she did not spend a lot of time scolding Harry around , and Snape told all the teachers what had happened quite accurately . 
Harry was called out of the common room and suffered fifty minutes of tension in Professor MacGonagall's office , who said he was extremely lucky not to be expelled and strongly endorsed Snape's discipline decision . reserved for Harry every Saturday until the end of the school year . I said there was something unusual about the Prince , Hermione said , obviously can not stop . And I was right , was not it ? No , I do not think you're right , Harry stubbornly said . 
You have had enough bad time not to mention Hermione's teaching ; The look of the Quidditch team when Harry claimed he could not play on Saturday was the heaviest penalty . 
Harry felt Ginny's look but did not dare look her in the eye , afraid that he would see frustration or anger there . 
He has just announced that Ginny will be playing as Sean on Saturday , and Dean will play Ginny . 
Perhaps , if Gryffindor wins , Ginny and Dean will reconcile it . The thought goes through Harry like a knife Harry , Hermione speaks , How can he still cling to that book when his words - Chewing on each book story is not ? ! Harry interrupted her . The Prince only transcribed that note ! Not that he advises people to use it ! 
We only know that he may only keep what was used against him . I do not believe it , Hermione said . Actually , he's just trying to defend - - I do not defend what I did ! Harry quickly responded . I wish I had never done that , not only because I had about two meetings . 
You know you will not use such a word , even for Malfoy ; but he could not blame the prince , he did not write ' try this , it's good ' - he just kept writing for himself , not anyone else . Are you saying that , says Hermione , you will come back - and get the book ? 
Yes , Harrt responded strongly . Listen , if not for the Prince , I did not reach Felix Felicis . 
I could not save Ron when he was poisoned , not - - achieved the excellent reputation of toxic drugs he did not deserve , Hermion interference in a nasty way . Come on , Hermione ! Ginny spoke , and Harry was astonished , grateful , and he looked up . As it was then , Malfoy intended to use a Unforgivable Word , so glad that Harry had something good in hand to fight back ! Of course I'm glad Harry did not hit the curse ! Hermione said as if offended . But I can not call the Sectumsampra curse that's good , Ginny , look what it's causing him ! 
And I'm thinking , with what's causing it for the team's chances in the game - oh , do not start acting as if you understand Quidditch , Ginny steals your words , you just do yourself a favor . Harry and Ron were stunned to see Hermione and Ginny , who had been in great harmony with each other , both now sitting cross - legged , each looking in a furious direction . 
Ron looked at Harry anxiously , then grabbed a book and hid after that . 
However , Harry , knowing that he deserved to be , suddenly felt incredibly happy even if neither of them spoke to each other all night . 
Harry's carelessness did not last long . 
He also suffered sarcasm from the Slytherin members the following day , not to mention the grievances of Gryffindor himself when he learned that his teammates were banned from playing in the final game of the season . 
On Saturday morning , despite what he had said to Hermione , Harry willingly traded all of Felix Felicis in the world to be with Ron and Ginny and the others going down to Quidditch . 
He felt as unbearable as turning his back to the flow of people who were streaming out into the sunshine , all of them wearing rose banners , hats , flying banners and scarves , to go . go down the dark tunnel and go until the sound of the crowd seems to be gone , knowing that you will not be able to hear it either as a comment or as a shout or scream . Well , Potter , Snape said , as Harry knocked on the door and stepped into the familiar office in an uncomfortable way that Snape had not yet vacated even now the class was upstairs ; The room was as vague as ever , and still full of dead mucus hanging from the poison bottles around the wall . frantically , on the table where Harry would sit , there were many boxes full of spider webs ; It looks like it will be a tedious , difficult and useless job . Superintendent Filch is looking for someone to clean up these old records , Snape said softly . These are records of Hogwarts law violations and their punishment . 
Where the ink is blurred , or the cards are bitten by the mouse , you will copy the sins and punishments , and they will be sorted in alphabetical order , and placed back into the box . Yes , Professor , Harry replied , with all the contempt he could use , in the last three words . I think you can start , Snape said with a malicious smile on his lips , from the box of thousands of twelve to one thousand fifty - six . 
You will find some familiar names which make the job more interesting . Here , take a look . He drew a card from one of the boxes on the same note , and 
read : James Potter and Sirius Black . 
Being caught using an illegal charm on Bertram Aubrey causes Aubrey's head to double . 
Discipline is double . Snape smirked . It would be comforting to think that , despite their disappearance , the records of their great achievements still Harry felt the familiar bubbling feeling in his belly . 
Clenching his teeth to try not to retaliate , he sat down in front of the boxes and drew a card toward him . 
As Harry had predicted , it was a boring , useless , sometimes disruptive job ( as Snape intended it to be ) with sharp blows in his stomach as Harry read his father and son's name . Sirius's godfather , who often travels together in small plays , is sometimes joined by Remus Lupine and Peter Pettigrew . 
And while Harry copied all of their various offenses and penalties , he could not help wondering what was going on outside , where the match had just begun . Ginny was playing as a scorer against Harry . constantly glancing at the watch on the wall . 
It seemed as if the needles were running as fast as half the normal timepieces , perhaps because Snape had made the spell possible , causing it to rotate so slowly . 
You can not just be here half an hour an hour and a half . Harry's stomach twitched when the clock was twelve - and - a - half . 
Snape has not spoken since after the assignment to Harry finally looked up at the clock at ten o ' clock . I think that is enough , he said coldly . 
mark the place you've been to . 
Continue at ten o ' clock next week . Yes , Professor . Harry stuffed a card that had been folded into the box and rushed out the door before Snape changed his mind , hurried toward the stone steps , straining his ears hoping to hear any sound from Quidditch , but Everything was silent So the battle was over . Waited in the crowded hall , then Harry ran up the marble stairs ; If Gryffindor wins or loses , the team will also celebrate or condolence in the common room . Quid agis ? He said hesitantly to Mrs. Bug , wondering what was going on inside . You will see , Ms . Béo replied not to express some expression . 
And she dodged aside . 
The screams of the celebratory party rang out from her back hole . 
Harry gasped as everyone screamed at him ; A series of arms dragged him inside . We win ! Shouted Ron , dancing and waving his trophy in Harry's direction . We won ! 
Four hundred and fifty points compared to a hundred and forty ! 
We win ! Harry looked around ; Over there Ginny was running towards him ; With her eyes fixed and shining , she wrapped her arms around Harry . 
And without thinking , or anticipating , did not mind the fifty people watching , Harry kissed Ginny . 
After a long time - or maybe half an hour - it may also be after a few days of sunshine - the two split up . 
The room became silent . 
Then some people whistled and giggles . 
Harry looked over at Ginny's head , looking as though Dean Thomas was holding a broken glass in his hand , and Romilda Vane looked as though she was about to throw something . 
Hermione looked radiant , but Harry's eyes searched Ron . 
Eventually Harry found him still clutching the trophy and wearing a face that looked like a stick in his head . 
Within a fraction of a second they looked at each other , then Ron nodded , which Harry understood meant , Hmm - if you had to . 
The one in Harry's chest screams in victory , he looks down at Ginny , and without a word , gestures out of the portrait . 
A walk in the yard seems necessary , in which - if there is time - both can discuss the game . 
CHAPTER 25 The prophecy was heard 
Harry's disapproval of Ginny Weasley seems to be of great interest , especially to the girls , anyway , the last few weeks Harry was happy to talk about it . After all , there was an interesting Harry It is still remembered because it is attracted to the terrible situation of black magic . 
" Do you know what people are saying about you now ? " Ginny said as she sat on the floor , in the living room , and read the Daily Prophet . What Rolmida Vane did was ask if he really had a hippo tattoo on his chest ? Ron and Hermione both laughed but Harry ignored them . 
" What did you say to him ? " " I told him it was a Hungarian forest bee , " Ginny said , flipping to another page in a lazy way . " More than a macho man . " " Thanks , " Harry grinned . " And Ron ? " " A dwarf , but you have not said where tattoos are ? " Ron scowled as Hermione rolled over to laugh . 
" Watch out , " Ron pointed at Harry and Ginny . " Just because I'm okay does not mean I can not take my word back . " " Lets , " Ginny mumbled . " What do you allow me to do when , anyway , you said you liked Harry more than Michael or Dean ? " " Yes , I say , " Ron said reluctantly . Hugging each other in front of everyone . "" You're a hypocrite ! 
What about you and Lavender ? 
The two are wrapped around like a pair of worms everywhere . " Ginny retorted , but Ron's tolerance should not have been too much of a challenge to them , though , despite the fact that Harry and Ginny's time together was much smaller . 
Ginny's Gloomy Wizard was approaching , so she was forced to revisit at night . One night , Ginny went to the library , and Harry was sitting in the common room next to the window , It pretends to be a complete herbal exercise , but it really is a flashback of a fun time out on the edge of the lake next to Ginny's lunch time . The face is not very pleasant . " I want to talk to you , Harry . " " What ? " Harry asked suspiciously . 
Just yesterday , Hermione was slipping right in her face because it made Ginny distracted as the day was approaching . 
" Oh , do not , " harry moaned . " Please put it aside . " He did not even dare return to That Needy Room to retrieve the book , its actions at In the poison class it suffers ( though Slughorn , who agrees with Ginny , jokes that Harry is the same ) . But it sure was that Snape had not given up hope of touching the book and had to leave the book there while Snape was watching over it . 
" I did not leave " Hermione resolutely " .. until you hear me say . 
Now I'm trying to find some clue about who is interested in creating dark magic . 
" He does not like it . "" That person , who is that person ? " Prince , Hermione , Prince ? " " That's right , " said Hermione , her red cheeks flushed from her briefcase and flopped down on the table in front of her . Harry , look at this picture . " Harry picked up the newspaper , staring at the stained picture , Ron leaned down to see . 
In the picture is a girl about fifteen years old . She is not very beautiful , looks very uncomfortable and sad with long dark brows , face pale . 
Below the photo is the note : Eileen Prince , captain of Gobstoned , Hogwarts . 
" Really , " said Harry , gazing intently at the article about the photograph . It was a stupid story about the intercollegiate trophy . " The girl's name is Eileen Prince . 
Prince , understand Harry . " They looked at each other and then Harry realized what Hermione had said . 
She laughed . 
" No , " " What ? " " You think she's half - blood .. ? " " Why ? " " Why not ? 
Harry , there's no real prince in the magical world ! That may be a nickname , a self - given name , or maybe their common name , right ? 
Oh , listen to this ! 
If so , her father was a magician with the Prince family , and her mother was a Muggle , so she was " Prince - bloody " . " Wow , that's brilliant , Hermione ... " Maybe she's proud of being a blood - thirsty Prince . "" Listen , Hermione , I can say that's not a girl , and I can only say that . " " The truth is , you do not think girls can be so talented ! " Hermione was angry . 
" So how do you deny yourself over the past five years that you think you're not good at girls ? " Harry bitterly replied , " that's just the way people write . 
I just knew Prince was a guy . 
This girl does not have to do anything to do it . Anyway , where did you get this ? " library " Hermione replied , " There is a collection of ancient prophets . 
Well , I'm going to find a bit more information about Eileen if possible . 
"" Do it yourself , " Harry snapped . 
" Well done , " said Hermione , " and the first place I was looking for . " Triggered Harry as he walked toward the portrait . " Harry's scoop was the prize of poison . " Harry scowled at Hermione and continued to drop in . the sky is out there . 
" She never thought you could outnumber her , " said Ron , returning to her magical copy of One Thousand Fungus and Miracle Herbs . 
" You do not want to get angry , I ' ll take back that book . " " Of course not , " said Ron briskly . " Prince is a genius . 
Anyway ... without the wand .... " Ron put his fingers across his neck in a meaningful way . " I do not want to talk about this . I think the magic you use for Molfoy is great . "" Me too , " Harry said quickly , " but it was also cured , did not it ? "" That's right , " said Harry , " that's all right , even though it was uncomfortable in my heart all the time . "" Are you still banned from Snape ? " Ron continued . " Still , from Saturday to Saturday , " Harry sighed . 
" He said if I did not finish my assignment this year , five - star will continue . 
" It was really boring to be banished because it had spent most of its time with Ginny . 
Indeed , it has always wondered whether Snape knew this or not , as Snape kept it for longer . 
Suddenly the appearance of Jimmy Peakes pulled it out of his sour thoughts . Jimmy gave him the parchment scroll . 
" Thank you , Jimmy , ... Dumbledore ! " Harry excitedly opened the paper and read it intently . " I want to see you urgently . " The harry looked at each other . 
" Oh " Ron whispered , " You guessed wrong ... " 
You did not know ... ? "" I better get there soon , " Harry said , and jumped out . 
He hurried out of the living room , walking down the seventh floor at the fastest speed . 
There was no one in the corridor but my darling Peeves rolled over and crushed Harry like he used to do and then smiled dickily . Then the Peeves disappeared , the corridor becoming silent ; And everyone has returned to their living room 15 minutes before the curfew . 
Harry suddenly heard the screams along with the crash . 
It stopped and listened . 
" What - dare - a ! " The sound came from a nearby corridor . 
Harry rushed to the side , ready to wand in hand , to the corner of the corridor , he saw Professor Trelawney lying on the floor , wrapped around the shawl , while the bottle was next to him , there was a bellows . " Professor " Harry hurried to help Professor Trelawney stand up . Her stringy beads were tangled in glasses . 
She huffed , patted her head , pushing Harry's hand . 
" What's wrong , ma ' am ? " " Looks like I'm asking too much , " she said in a shrill voice . " She's walking , just thinking about the brief moments in her head . " But Harry very interested in that . 
He is paying attention to where he is standing : on the left is a dancing duck - shaped mat , on the right is a thick stone wall covering something . " Teacher , are you trying to enter the Needy Room ? " " ... you were informed - what ? " She inquired . " Room of necessity , " repeated Harry . " Are you trying to get in there ? " " She - ah - you do not know the student is allowed to know about it . " " There's nothing they do not know , " said Harry . " But what's going on ? so ? 
She screamed ... It sounded like she was attacked ... "" Cum - " The tralawnwy said , wrapping the towel and looking at Harry with wide eyes . " She wanted - " Well , some stuff in the room . " And she muttered something like " dirty accusation . " " Hary said , staring at the bottoms on the floor . " Can not you hide it ? " Harry was very strange . In front of the room appeared when he wanted to hide the book The Prince of Hybrids . 
" Oh , no , she was there , " said Trelawney , her eyes glaring at the wall . " But who's there before ? " " Who ? " Harry demanded . 
" Who is in it ? " " You do not know , " said Mrs. Tralawney , a little surprised at Harry's insistent tone . " She went into the room when she heard a voice , a voice she had never heard before , 
In her years of hiding , use this room . " " A voice ? 
What is it talking about ? "" You do not know what it says , it looks like it's cheering . 
" Reo happy ? " A joyous way . " She nodded slightly . 
Harry looked at her . 
" Is that male or female ? " " You guessed it was male , " she replied . 
" And it sounded good ? " " Yes , very good , " she assured him . 
" As if it was celebrating something ? " " Sure it is . " " And then - " " Then she asked , ' Who ? ' " " You can not find out who that person is before you speak ? " Harry asked , slightly daunted . 
" The spiritual eye , " she said with a serious expression , reshaping the shawl and thread . 
" Well chosen to hear the mundane voice . " " Yeah , " Harry said hastily ; He had heard much about Trelawney's spiritual eye before . " And the voice said who was there . " " No , " she said . " It was dark and then she was thrown out of the room ! " " And you do not know anything ? " Said Harry . 
" No , you do not know , like you said , throwing - " She stopped talking and looked at Harry suspiciously . 
" I think you should tell Dumbledore , " said Harry . " You should know about Malfoy's celebration - you mean about the one who threw you ? " A little surprised , Trelawney stifled at this suggestion , yes . annoyance 
" The principal said he would see me less , " she said coldly . 
" I do not want to talk to people who do not understand the value of prophetic words . 
If Dumbledore wants to ignore the card's warning - " Suddenly her bony arm tightened Harry's wrist . 
" Every time , no matter what I pointed out to them - " suddenly , Trelawney pulled out a card from his shawl . 
" The tower was struck by lightning , " she whispered . " The disaster . 
coming very close ... 
"" That's right , " Harry repeated . " Well , I still think you should tell Dumbledore about the voice , the things that happened in the dark , and the fact that you were thrown out of the room ... " really ? " Professor Trelawney hesitated for a moment , but it could be said that the idea told Dumbledore he was a bit adventurous . 
" Now I have to go to see you " Harry " I have an appointment with you . 
We can go together . " 
" Well , if so , " the professor smiled . 
She ends up picking up bottles of wine and throwing them roughly into the large white streaks on the nearby niches . 
" You left the baby in the classroom . " She moved while they were on the road . " You may not be a great prophet ... but you are a great object ... " Harry did not respond , reluctantly becoming an object of prophecy about her misfortune . 
" You're afraid , " she continued , " the little horse , alas , a centaur - not knowing about tarot cards . 
She asked him if she knew about it , did she feel the upcoming disaster was unclear ? 
but he seemed to find her funny . 
yes , it's funny " Her voice was a bit agitated , and Harry heard a strong thump from the bottle , though it was thrown back . 
" Maybe the centaur heard someone say that she inherited the gift from her great - great grandmother . 
Gossip is often rumored by jealous people for years . 
You know who you talk to , Harry ? 
Dumbledore had taught her at this wonderful school , putting so much faith in her over the years , had not she shown her that ? " Harry murmured something unknown . 
" She still remembered very well the first time Dumbledore had interviewed her . 
" Mrs. Trelawney continued in a hoarse voice . 
" You are really impressed , yes , very impressed ... She was sitting in the Pig's shop , randomly - bugs , cats - but low pay . " Dumbledore politely called me in . room . 
He asked her ... 
You have to admit that , for the first time , she thought that he was not good for fortune telling ... and she began to feel a bit strange , she did not eat much that day ... but then ... " And now Harry was paying a lot of attention for the first time , because he knew what was going on at that time : Trelawney had prophesied something that had changed his life , about Voldemort . 
" ... but then we were severely interrupted by Severus Snape ! " " What ? " " Yeah , there was something out the door and it popped open , the rude drunk standing with Snape , said they were wrong room . 
Still , she was afraid he was eavesdropping on the interview between her and Dumbledore , you know , at the time he was looking for work , and there was no doubt about getting a job ! 
Well , then , you know , Dumbledore seems to be ready for her job , and she can not help but think , Harry , that's because he appreciates the complete difference between humility . Your true talent and talents are compared to the lemonade , the winner , the one who sneaks out - Harry - dear ? " Looking through , Miss Trelawney realized that Harry was no longer standing by her side , standing there , about ten feet from her . 
" Harry , " she hesitated . 
His face was white , making her slightly frightened and fearful . 
Harry was standing motionless as if shocked by a shock , in a row , wiping out everything except what he did not want to remember . 
It was Snape , who heard the prophecy . 
He brought the prophecy to Voldemort . 
Snape along with Peter Pettigrew helped Voldemort hunt Lily and James and their son ... 
Everything else becomes meaningless for Harry at the moment . 
" Harry , " repeated Trelawney . 
" Do you think we have to go to the principal ? " " You stay here , " Harry said through his stiff lips . 
" But , darling ... you have to tell him how you got attacked in the room - " " You stay here , " Harry repeated angrily . 
Trelawney was frightened as Harry ran past her , crossing the corridor to Dumbledore's chambers , where a monster was guarded . 
Harry screams the password at the animal's head , then runs up the moving spiral staircase , launching it three times . 
At the place , it does not move strongly to the door , then jump into the room before the calm voice " Inviting " sounded . 
Fawles looked around , his bright black eyes glittering , yellowish , reflecting with the sun shining through the window . 
Dumbledore stood by the window , looking out into the yard , holding a long gown in his hands . 
" Oh , Harry , you promised me to go with you . " For a moment , Harry did not understand what he was saying . 
Talking to Miss Trelawney had messed everything up in her head and her brain seemed to have 
is operating slowly . 
" Just go with me ... ? " " Only if you want , of course . " " If you ... " Harry suddenly remembered the reason he eagerly rushed here at first . 
" Did you find out ? 
Did you find Horcux ? "" I suppose so . 
" Resentment and anger had caused a shock to Harry , who was agitated : for a moment he was speechless . 
" I'm afraid of course , " he said . 
" I'm not afraid ! " Immediately Harry said , but that was absolutely right ; Fear is the only feeling it feels at the moment . 
Where are you ? "" I'm not sure - though , I think we can eliminate the serpents - but I believe he hid in a cave on a beach a mile away , Searching for a long time : Tom Riddle has threatened the two orphans with him on an annual trip , do you remember ? "" Oh , " said Harry . 
" How is it protected ? " " I do not know , I suspect something is blurry , " he hesitated , then said , " Harry , I promise you I can go with you , and you keep my word . Promise me , but I'm wrong not to tell you this is going to be extremely dangerous . 
" I ' ll go , " said Harry , even before Dumbledore had warned him . 
Snape hated Snape , his desire to do something adventurous and reckless has risen tenfold . 
It seemed this was on Harry's face , for Dumbledore left the window , approached Harry and looked at it more closely , wrinkles appearing between his silver eyebrows . 
" What's wrong ? " " Yes , nothing , " Harry lied . 
" What do you worry about ? " " I'm not worried . " " Harry , I'm never a good Occlumens - " the words sparked back to Harry's wrath . 
" Snape ! " He shouted , the Fawkes screamed slightly behind them . " It was Snape , and he told Voldemort about the prophecy . 
Himself . 
He had been listening outside , Ms . Trelawney said . " Dumbledore's demeanor had no other expression , but Harry thought his face had changed in the light of the sun's rays . 
For a moment , he did not say anything . 
" When did you hear that ? " He finally said . 
" Just now ! " Said Harry , trying not to scream . Suddenly , he no longer mastered himself . 
" And the teacher was here to teach him , and he got VOLDEMORT SEARCHING FOR PARENTING ! " As if he had just been fighting , Harry turned away from him , who did not even notice a change , and Still walking back and forth in the room , rubbing the knuckles together . 
Harry wants to get angry and rush into the teacher , but he also wants to go with him to destroy Horcux ; She wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man who believed in Snape , but he was afraid he would not take it if he could not control his anger . " It's hard to stop him going back and forth as if he had to refrain from screaming . 
He stopped thinking , pursed his lips , looked at his wrinkled face . 
" Professor Snape did one thing - " " Do not tell me that's just a mistake , sir , he's been peeping out the door ! " " Do not interrupt me . " Dumbledore waited for Harry to nod . How curtly is it ? " Professor Snape made a serious mistake . 
He was still Voldemort's henchman on the night when he overheard the first half of Professor Trelawney's prophecy . 
Of course , he must immediately tell the subject that it has a profound influence on his master . 
but he did not know - he could not know - the baby Voldemort had hunted before , that is , his parents were killed in Voldemort's carnage , which he knew very well . His parents - ' Harry did not scream anymore but instead was a grin . 
" He hates the three like hating Sirius . 
Did you notice , professor , he hated to death . "" I can not imagine how he felt remorse when he saw the way Voldemort did prophecy . . 
Harry , I believe that's the biggest regret in his life and that's why he came back . " But he's a good Occlumens , teacher ? " Said Harry , his voice trembling , trying to keep himself calm . 
" And Voldemort did not convince Snape to take his side ? 
Teacher ... How can you be sure Snape is on our side ? " Master Dumbledore did not say anything , he looked like he was deciding something . Finally he said , " I'm sure . 
You believe Severus Snape . " Harry took a deep breath , trying to keep his own opinion . 
" Well , I'm not , " said Harry as loudly as possible . " Now Snape is having something blurry with Malfoy , right under his nose , and he still - " " I've talked about this , Harry . " he said , his voice sounding cool now . " You told me your point . 
"" You will leave school tonight and the fish will not know that Snape and Malfoy have decided - "" What ? " Teacher raised his eyebrows . " I guess what are they doing ? " I ... they're making a decision , " said Harry , hands rubbing against each other . " Professor Trelawney entered the room , she wanted to hide some bottles of wine , and she heard Malfoy cheering , it Trying to do something very dangerous . 
And if you still intend to leave the school without - "" enough , " said Dumbledore . 
He said calmly , Harry stopped . 
He knew it had gone too far . " Do you see that you are absent without any protection at school during this school year ? 
Tonight , when you leave , there will be more substitutes . Please do not think that you do not seriously regard the safety of your student , Harry ? "" I'm not . " Harry was a little confused , but Dumbledore did not notice . 
" I do not want to discuss anything else about this anymore . " She deliberated but stopped , afraid that it would be too much time to ruin the opportunity to go with him , but to continue , " Do you want to go with the teacher ? now ? " Yes , " Harry said at once . 
" Well , listen to this . " 
He straightened up . 
" I will take you with the condition : I must obey all the requirements you give here , not asked at all . " " Yes , " " Sure I understand , Harry . 
I mean , you have to follow orders like ' 
run ' , ' escape ' , ' step back ' , you understand "" me - yes , okay . " If you told me to hide , would you do that ? "" Yes . "" If you tell me to hide , will you obey ? " " Yes " . 
" If you tell me to leave you and save yourself , will you do as you say ? " " You - " " Harry ? " The two teachers looked at each other . 
" Yes , sir . " " Very good . 
Now you want me to get your invisibility cloak and see you in the hall in five minutes . " He came back , by the window . 
The sun is now shining a gleaming pink glow at the bottom of the horizon . 
Harry hurried out of the room , down the spiral staircase . 
Her heart suddenly has something very hard to describe . He knows what he is doing . 
Ron and Hermione were sitting in the common room when she returned . 
" What did Dumbledore say ? " Asked Hermione . " Harry , are you alright ? " 
" I'm fine , " said Harry briefly , coming quickly through them . He hurried up the stairs , into the boys ' bedroom , opened his chest , pulled out a map of the bandits , and wore socks . He returned to the living room , stopping at where Ron and Hermione sat , watching him with astonished eyes . 
" I do not have much time . " Harry panted . 
" Dumbledore called for his invisibility cloak , heard this ... " He spoke quickly about where it was going and why . He could not stop Hermione from scared or Ron's thoughts . Later they can discuss more details . 
" So you two understand ? " Harry said quickly . 
" Dumbledore is not going to be here tonight , so Malfoy will easily do it . 
No , listen to me ! " He sent angrily as both Hermione and Ron wanted to interrupt . 
" I know what Malfoy organizes in Need . 
" He pushed the map into Hermione's hands . " You must watch that guy and Snape . 
Dumbledore said he would increase the protection at school , but if Snape was involved , he would know what Dumbledore had trapped and how to neutralize them - but he did not know how to get old , right ? " Harry " Hermione started , her eyes wide with fear . 
" I do not have time to argue , " Harry said in a low voice . " Hold on this . " - He was holding Ron's socks . 
" Thank you , " said Ron , " oh , why do you need it ? " " Then you have to pack it up . 
that is Felix Felicis . 
Share it with Ginny . 
Send goodbye to her for her . 
Well , I have to go here , Dumbledore is waiting - "" No , " said Hermione , as Ron opened the little yellow bottle , panicking . " We do not need it , you keep it , you know . What are you going to face ? " I'm fine . 
I ' ll go with Dumbledore . " Said Harry . 
" I want to know that you're okay . 
Oh , do not be like that , Hermione . 
I ' ll meet you later . " Then , harry left , going through the portrait hole , hurrying to the hall . 
Dumbledore was waiting for him in front of the oak door . 
He turned around as Harry reached the third level , he gasped , feeling a little flush . " I want you to put on my robe , please . " Dumbledore said , and waited for Harry to finish . " Very good . 
Let's go " 
He walked down the stone steps . 
Harry rushed to the side , under an invisibility cloak , still panting and sweating . 
" But what would people think of leaving school ? " harry asked , thinking of Malfoy and Snape in his heart . 
" You have to go to Hogmead to drink something , " he said softly . 
" Sometimes you are a patron of Rosmerta , or a pig's head ... it's the best way to hide the place you really want to go to . 
" They came down to the courtyard at dusk . 
The air smelled of pleasant grass , the smell of the lake , and the smell of burning fire coming from Hagrid's house . 
It is hard to believe that they are confronted with dangerous , terrible things . 
" Teacher , " Harry whispered , when the gate appeared at the end of the line , " We ' ll be Apparating ? " " Yes , I can Apparate now , I believe , " he replied . 
" Yes , but I have not got a certificate , " said Harry . 
It feels best to be honest ; What would happen if it ruined everything by its appearance at where it was going hundreds of miles ago . 
" No problem , " said Dumbledore . " You can help me again . " 
They passed through the gate , ducked into the shadows , leaving the trail to Hogmead . 
The night went as fast as they went and when they reached the big road , it was already dark . The lights flashed from the windows of the shops . 
As they approached the Three Broom Shop , they heard a husky scream . 
" Go out ! " cried Rosmerta , a dirty - looking man thrown out . 
" Oh , hello Albus ... You're out late ... " " Good night , Mrs. Rosmerta , ... excuse me , I go to the Pork bar ... do not mean to bother you . But tonight I like the quiet atmosphere ... " A minute later , they came to the corner of the street , the sign of the pork bar stalled without a breeze . , empty bar , no guest . 
" We do not need to go in , " he said quietly , looking around him . " As long as no one sees us ... now , hold your hand , Harry . 
No need to be so tight , just take the lead . 
Come on , let's count to three : one ... two ... three ... " Harry turned around . Immediately , a disgusting sensation that the corpse was squeezed by a rigid rubber tube , it could not . breathing , all over it was crushed even though it tried to endure , and only when it thought he would die as if the invisible wire was cut off . 
He found himself standing in the cold darkness , he inhaled the lung fresh air , salty . 
Finally , after the night forget to eat , the day forget to sleep , I finally finished translation . 
Pee slowly read that ha . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 26 The cave 
Harry could feel the saltiness of the sea , the waves pounding the shore ; a cold , light breeze that disturbed the hair , as it watched the sea - the moonlit sea and the starry sky . 
It was standing on a tall rock , the sea stirring the bubbles below . 
He glanced over his shoulder . 
A cliff standing behind them , steep , black and no shape . 
The stones 
Harry and Dumbledore were standing , looking as if they had been left from the stone wall . 
The scenery was dry and empty , the sea and the rocks were clinging to each other without a shade of grass , grass or a sandbank . What do you think ? Asked Dumbledore . Harry's idea of ​​ whether this is a good place for a picnic . 
Did they bring the children from the orphanage here ? Harry asked , he could hardly imagine a secluded place for a picnic . 
Not exactly here . 
Dumbledore said . There is a village halfway along the cliffs behind us . 
I think the children were led there to catch the sea breeze and watch the waves . 
No , I think only Tom Riddle and some of his victims have come here . 
No Muggle can climb here unless it's a good mountaineer , boats can not park in the cliffs , the water around the cliff is too dangerous . 
I thought Riddle did not climb , magic would be better than ropes . 
And he brought two kids with him , probably for his enjoyment of scaring them . 
I think it's too sad to be alone , right ? 
Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt something . But his last stop - ours - is far from here . come here . Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the edge where the jagged hollows would be the fulcrum to climb down to the rocks half submerged in water and near the cliff . It was an incredible climb and Dumbledore was hindered a bit by the injured hand , moving slowly . 
The bottom slates are slippery because of seaweed . 
Harry could spot the sea vapor that hit his face . Lumos , said Dumbledore , as he approached the nearest rock of the cliff . 
The glittering yellow lights on the black water below where she was standing ; Black cliffs behind the instrument also sparkle . Do you see ? Dumbledore whispered , raising his wand slightly . 
Harry saw a slit open on the cliffs , swirling circles around him . Are you afraid of getting wet ? No , Harry answered . Take off your invisibility cloak - now no need - let's go down , And with the agility of a young man , leave the Dumbledore's stone jumping to the sea , and start to swim , with the the perfect hand , to the cliffs of the cliff , the wand is clenched in his mouth . 
Harry takes off his invisibility cloak , puts it in his pocket , and follows . 
Cold water , Harry's clothes are now soaked , heavy and quite entangled . 
The hard breath filled with the smell of salt and seaweed , Harry did not mind and tried to swim under the dim light , now dim fade into the cave . 
The store soon opened a dark cave that Harry thought would probably be flooded by the tide . 
The two sides of the cliff are separated by a small distance , damp and dim with little light from Dumbledore's wand . 
Deeper , the tunnel bends to the left , and it is found that the tunnel has eaten quite deep into the cliff . 
He continued to swim under Dumbledore , his fingertips beginning to numb against the rugged and damp cliffs . 
At that moment he saw Dumbledore jutting out of the water , his silver hair and his cloak . 
When Harry arrives , he sees the stairs leading to a large cave . 
He climbs hard , the water is disturbed from his sodden clothes , it is hard to contain tremors in the cold air around him . 
Dumbledore stood in the center of the cave , raising his wand , slowly examining the cliffs and ceiling . Yes , this is the place , Dumbledore said . 
Why do you know ? Harry whispered . It's magic , Dumbledore said shortly . 
Harry could hardly determine whether his trembling was due to cold or excitement . 
He looked at Dumbledore who was still looking around , obviously focused on things Harry could not even know . This is just the outside , the entrance , Dumbledore said after a while . We need to get inside .... These are the barriers of Vodemort for us , rather than the difficulties of nature .... Dumbledore reached for the cave wall and touched his dark brown fingers , murmuring words in a strange voice that Harry did not understand . 
Dumbledore went around the cave twice , watching almost all the stones , sometimes hesitantly pulling his hands away and then touching somewhere , until he finally stopped , pointing Definitely cliff . This place , he said . 
We continue from here , where the entrance has been covered . Harry did not ask how he knew . 
He had never seen a witch do this , simply by looking and touching his hand ; But Harry has long learned that explosions and smoke are often traces of inferiority to true ability . 
Dumbledore stepped back , pointing the wand to the stone . 
In a moment , the silhouette of a dome appears , with brilliant white light behind . Open it - it is ! Harry said in the shudder of his teeth , but before the words came out of his mouth , the silhouette disappeared , becoming the same stone slab as before . Harry , I'm sorry , I forgot , he said and pointed his wand at Harry , his clothes now becoming dry and warm as if they were dried under fire . Thank you , Harry said sincerely , but Dumbledore was now paying attention back to the cliff . 
You do not use any more magic , simply stand there and watch intently , as if there is something extremely attractive written on it . 
Harry stood still , not wanting to break Dumbledore's attention . 
After about two minutes of fairly stressful air , Dumbledore said calmly , Oh , that's not it . 
Too cruel . What is it , Professor ? I think , Dumbledore and said and put his wounded hand inside the cloak and drew a short silver knife like the one Harry used to cut when made in the poison layer , we were asked Pay something to go through . Pay ? Asked Harry . Do we have to give the door something ? Yes , Dumbledore answered . Blood , if I'm not mistaken . Blood ? I said that it was cruel , Dumbledore answered , in a voice of contempt and even despair , as if the Vodemort had gone a little further than Dumbledore had foretold . I mean , sure that you will understand , that we have to weaken ourselves to get inside . 
Again , Lord Voldemort failed to understand that there was much worse than physical pain . Yeah , but , if I could avoid it ... Harry said , it was painful so it looked a bit nervous . Sometimes , however , could not be avoided , Dumbledore said and pulled his sleeve up , revealing his injured arm . Sir ! Harry protested , as soon as Dumbledore raised his knife . I will do it , Son - It does not know what to say - younger , more appropriate ? 
But Dumbledore just smiled . 
A flash of silver , and red rays of blood , the face of the stone covered with shining blood . You're so good , Harry , Dumbledore said , pointing his wand at the deep cut he had 
On his arm , it heals immediately , as if Snape had healed Malfoy so badly , and this time it did not go away : The rocket's blood splashes disappeared , opening a completely dark entrance . toothpick . Follow me , Dumbledore said , and walked in with Harry , who was hurrying to light his wand . 
A strange sight in front of them : They were standing on the edge of a great lake , so wide that Harry could not imagine the width , the cave was so big that the ceiling was too much . 
A faint blue light in the distance , perhaps in the middle of the lake ; It is reflected by the perfectly flat water below . 
The blue light and the light from the two wands are probably the only things that break the dark , though the light can not go as far as Harry wants . 
The darkness seems denser than usual . 
Let's walk , Dumbledore whispered . Be careful not to step on water . Follow me . Their footsteps made an echo on the narrow rocky shore of the lake . They kept walking , but the scene was like a sliver , a dry cliff on one side , the other on the other . The darkness of the lake , in the middle is still a faint blue light mist . 
Harry felt a sense of suffocation and despair . Teacher ? Asked . Do you think Horcrux is here ? Oh yes , Dumbledore answered . I'm sure it's here . 
How hard , how to make it ? Why do not we ... not summon ? Harry said , sure it was a stupid proposition . 
But Harry was less worried now . 
We can , Dumbledore said , Why do not you try it ? How are you ? 
Oh ... yes ... Harry was not expecting such a situation , but he quickly overcame the hesitation and called out and waved his wand , Accio Horcrux ! A sound like an explosion , something big up from the water about 20 feet away , before Harry realized what it was , it was gone , leaving the waves above . Lake surface . 
Harry was surprised and hit the cliff ; Heart still beats when asked Dumbledore . What is it ? Something , I think it's ready to appear when we try to call Horcrux . Harry looked at the water . 
The surface of the lake was now flat like a mirror . 
The waves have disappeared abnormally ; Harry's heart , however . 
Still beating . You know that before ? I know that something will happen if we try to get Horcrux with normal effort . 
It was a good idea , Harry , but it was simple . But we do not know what the last thing was , Harry said , looking at the water flat . Those things , Dumbledore answered . I suspect that not just one . 
Should we go ? Sir ? Yes , Harry ? Do you think we have to go down the lake ? Down below ? 
Only if we are very unlucky . Do not you think the Hocrux is underneath ? Oh no ... . 
I think it's in the middle . And Dumbledore pointed his finger at the glowing blue light in the middle of the lake . So we have to cross the lake to get there ? Yes , I think so . Harry did not say anything . 
Its thinking now is about the water monsters , the giant lizards , the devils , the elves . 
Aha , Dumbledore uttered , and suddenly stopped , Harry stabbed him , he fell to the water , and his unarmed arm pulled it back . Sorry , Harry , I should warn you . Climbing to the cliff , I thought I had found it . Harry had no idea of ​​ what Dumbledore was saying ; This place is exactly like the places that have passed , but it looks like Dumbledore has discovered something strange . 
This time he used his hand , but not on the cliff but in the space around him , as if searching for and stealing something invisible . 
Oh , Dumbledore exclaimed happily , a moment later . 
The handler touched something in the space that Harry could not see . 
Dumbledore moved closer to the water , Harry watched curiously as his shoe was close to the edge of the rock . 
Still holding his hands tightly in the air , Dumbledore lifted his wand with the other hand and tapped his fist on the spot . 
Immediately a thick bronze chain of copper appeared , connecting from his grasping hand to the depths of the lake . 
Dumbledore pulled the chain around his hand like a snake , and it hit the rocky shore , making a shrill sound that echoed through the cliff , pulling something from the bottom of the lake . 
Harry did not say a word as a little boat floated on the water , a blue chain , with ripples rippling , as he slowly reached the edge where Harry and Dumbledore were standing . How do you know it ? Harry asked in astonishment . Magic always leaves traces , Dumbledore replied , as the boat touched the rock with a slight whistle , occasionally the tracks were very individual . 
I taught Tom Riddle . 
I know his style . It . 
Is the boat safe ? Oh yes , I think so . 
Voldemort needed to create a tool to cross the lake without provoking what he had created in case he wanted to visit or retrieve Horcrux . So what would be beneath the water that would not do us any good if we were using Voldemort's boat ? I think we should think that they will recognize , we are not the lord Voldemort . 
Anyhow , now we have done very well . 
They gave us the boat . But why do they give us ? Asked Harry , feeling the view from below the water as it turned away . Voldemort may have reason to believe that no one but a great sorcerer can find the boat , Dumbledore replied . I think he was prepared for this , he knew , because whoever was able to find the boat knew that he had barriers ahead that only he could go through . 
We wait to see if this is true . Harry looked at the boat . 
It's really tiny . It's not like it can hold two people at a time . 
Can it contain both of us ? 
Are we too heavy ? Dumbledore shook his head . Voldemort does not care about weight matters , he only cares about magic through his lake . 
I think a curse was placed on the boat so that only one witch could use it . But - - - - ? I do not think I have a problem , Harry : You are young and not strong enough . 
Voldemort will never think of a sixteen - year - old boy coming here : I think that adding to his magic is fine too . Those words did not excite Harry ; Maybe Dumbledore knew that , so he added , Voldemor was wrong , Harry , Voldemort was wrong .... 
Age is foolishness when we despise youth .... 
Now , first , and careful not to water . Dumbledore stood by and Harry climbed carefully into the boat . 
Dumbledore stepped in , then dangled the dangling chain onto the deck of the boat . 
Harry sat hard . 
The boat began to move , quiet space only the boat surfing water ; It automatically moves , as if there is some invisible force that pulls it to the light in the middle of the lake . 
After a while , the cliffs disappear . 
They are in the middle of the ocean , the ocean has no waves . 
Harry watched the small waves made by the boat , and suddenly he saw a white light under the water . 
Teacher ! he screamed . Harry ? I thought I saw an arm under the water - a human arm ! Yes , I'm sure you see , Dumbledore said calmly . 
Harry looked at the water as if to see his arm again . Has it just jumped out of the water ? But Herry had answers before Dumbledore replied ; In the light of the wand , a man's body was lying under his face a few inches wide , his eyes wide , his hair and gown fluttering . There are corpses here ! Harry said urgently . 
Yes , Dumbledore calmly replied , but at the moment we do not need to worry about them . At this time Harry repeated , turning his gaze from the water to Dumbledore . It's okay if they do not do anything , Dumbledore answers . Do not be afraid of the corpses , Harry , just as there should be no fear of anything behind darkness . 
Lord Voldemort of course he is afraid and thinks we will . 
So again he proved his inferiority . 
It makes no sense when we are scared to look at death and darkness . : Harry did not say anything ; It agrees , but it still has a terrible thought inside the head about the bodies floating around and beneath it , and it can not believe that they are not dangerous . But one of them jumped , it said When you try to call Horcrux right , Dumbledore replied . I'm sure that when we get the Horcrux , they will not be friendly anymore . 
However , just as things are born from the cold and dark , they are afraid of light and warmth , which we will call upon to support when needed . 
Fire , Harry . Dumbledore added a smile as he answered Harry . 
Yes .... 
Yes ... . Harry quickly replied . 
He looked at the blue light that the shuttle was still passing by . 
It does not hide the fear it has . 
The lake is wide and deadly .... 
It seems like a lot of hours have passed since she met Professor Trelawney , since it melted Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis . 
It's natural to say goodbye longer to them .... 
And it still did not meet Ginny ... Almost there , Dumbledore said excitedly . 
The blue light was getting louder , the boat came up with something with a shock that Harry could not recognize for the first time , but as it lighted the wand's light , it realized they had hit a small island in the middle of the lake . Be careful not to water , Dumbledore repeated as Harry climbed out of the boat . 
Honor is no bigger than Dumbledore's office , which is the extension of the rock , the source of the blue light when viewed from afar . 
Harry was squinting , thinking that it was some kind of lamp , but then he realized that the light came from a stone pot like the Pensieve , and was reached on a pedestal . 
Dumbledore and Harry reached for the pot . 
They look inside . 
Inside it is filled with a liquid that emits a bright blue glow . What is it ? Asked Harry . I'm not sure , Dumbledore answered . Something more worrisome than blood and bodies . Dumbledore lifted his cloak on the side of his blackened hand , and pointed his fingers to the surface of the water . 
Teacher , no , do not touch - ! I did not touch , Dumbledore answered , smiling slightly . See , we can not touch closer . 
Let's see . Harry reached his hand inside the pot , and tried to touch that water . 
It touches an invisible barrier that separates it by almost an inch , no matter how hard it tries . Get out , Harry , Dumbledore said . 
He lifted his wand and made complicated movements above the liquid , and mumbled quietly . 
Nothing happens , except the water seems a bit brighter . 
Harry remained silent and looked at Dumbledore , but after he drew his wand , Harry felt good to talk . 
Do you think the Horcrux is here ? Oh , yes , Dumbledore leaned closer to the pot . 
Harry saw the mirror face on a blue liquid . But how to touch it ? 
It can not be touched by hand , disappears , or taken out , nor can it be used . Just as without thinking , Dumbledore lifted his wand again , and a small , glass - like glass appeared . 
We can only guess that this liquid is for drinking . What ? Said Harry . Are not ! Yes , we can only drink it , we can know what's underneath . But what if - he killed him ? Oh , I think about that , Dumbledore answered . Lord Voldemort did not want to kill him , but went to his island . Harry did not believe it . 
Has Dumbledore gone too far in recognizing the good inside ? Master , Harry keep calm , Master , it's our Voldemort - I'm sorry , Harry ; I should say , he did not want to immediately kill the man who had come to his island , Dumbledore said . He wants them to live to know why they can penetrate all of his barriers , and most importantly , why they dare drink the pot . Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that only he knows about the Horcruxes . Harry wanted to say but Dumbledore kept silent , looking at the liquid , seemed to think a lot . No doubt , he said , this country would do its duty to prevent us from taking the Horcrux . 
It will probably change me , so I do not remember why we are here , or cause more pain , or make us lose our ability . 
At that time , Harry , it was my job to continue to drink , even force me . 
Do you understand ? Their eyes look at the pot . 
Harry did not say anything . 
Why was it told to give Dumbledore something to drink that could hurt him ? Remember , Dumbledore said , the condition for me to follow you ? Harry looked hesitant , looking at his blue eyes , now turned green by the reflection of the water . But if - ? You promised , would not you , would do whatever I told you ? Yes , but - I warned you , did not you , would be dangerous ? Yes , Harry replied , but - well , Dumbledore replied , tucking his sleeve up and lifting the cup , I had my requests . Why can not you drink ? Harry asked desperately . Because we are older , smarter , and many times less useful . Dumbledore answered . Last time , Harry , I want your consent that you will do all we can to drink it . Can not do that - ? Can I have it ? 
But - You say it , Harry . It's okay , but - Before Harry could react a bit more , Dumbledore reached the glass into the water . 
For a moment , Harry wished that he could not touch it , but the glass touched as unobtrusively , as the glass was filled with water , Dumbledore brought it to his mouth . 
Good health , Harry . And drink all the water . 
Harry watched , worried , and scared . Sir ? he asked curiously , when Dumbledore dropped the empty cup , how do you feel ? Dumbledore shook his head , his face crushed . 
Harry wondered if he was in pain . 
Dumbledore got the cup back into the basin , filled it , and drank it again . teacher ? Harry said in a frightened voice . Do you hear me ? Dumbledore did not answer . 
Her face was like sleeping very drunk , but was dreaming a nightmare . 
Hold your hands on the cup of liquid water gradually , and the water as if want to flow . 
Harry took the cup and held it . Teacher , have you heard me ? It repeated loudly , creating an echo in the cave . 
Dumbledore sobbed and spoke in a voice that Harry did not recognize . 
I do not want to .... do not force me ... Harry stared at him , he did not know what to do . 
.... dislike ... . want to stop .... Dumbledore moaned . 
Teacher .... You can not stop , Master . Harry said , he said he would continue to drink , right ? 
You say you have to drink again . 
Here he scolds himself for what he is doing . 
Harry took the glass of water into his mouth and poured it . 
Are not ... . Whew whack Harry a glass again , I do not want to .... I do not want to .... Let's go .... It's alright , teacher . Hary said . It's okay - you go , stop it , Dumbledore pleads . 
Yes , this , Harry lied . 
He poured a glass of water into his mouth . 
Dumbledore shouted . No , no , no , no , I can not , I can not , do not pressure me , I do not want to .... It's alright , teacher , it's okay ! Harry could not hold the sixth cup with his trembling hands , the pot was half empty . Nothing , you are safe , it's not real , I swear it's not real - drink it , drink it .... And dumbly , Dumbledore took it as if it was the antidote Harry gave him , but then he put his face to his knees and trembled . It is my wander , all , sobbing . Please stop it , I know I was wrong , oh stop it , I will never again ... This will stop it , master . Said Harry and poured a seventh cup for the drinker . 
Dumbledore shrieked as if there were invisible torments all around him ; his crazy hand waving almost nearly spilled a new glass to fill Harry's hands , do not harm them , do not harm them , it is my fault , hurt me .... Here , drink it , drink it , you ' ll be fine , Harry said desperately , and again Dumbledore heard it . 
He fell forward , continued screaming , punching his fists on the ground , when Harry grabbed the ninth cup . 
Please , please , do not .... is not it . 
I will do everything .... Just drink a little , professor , just drink .... Dumbledore was drinking like a thirsty child , but when he had finished , he shouted that inside he was the fire . No , please do not continue .... Haeey filled the tenth cup and felt the cup touched the bottom of the pot . We're almost done , Professor . 
Drink it , drink it .... He helped Dumbledore get up and again he drank the cup ; When Harry walked away , the next cup , Dumbledore started screaming louder than ever , I want to die ! 
I want to die ! 
Stop it , stop it , I want to die ! Drink it , Professor . 
Drink it .... Dumbledore drank , and as soon as he finished , he screamed , KILLING ! This will be ! Harry gasped . Drink this .... 
It's over ... . 
all right Dumbledore grabbed the cup , drank it all , and something he wanted to say on his face . Are not ! Harry screamed , instead of pulling on ; he ran and got up ; His glasses almost fell out , his mouth open , his eyes closed . 
No , Harry and say and lay Dumbledore , no , you did not die , did not you , it was not poison , he woke up , woke up - Rennervate ! he cried , pointing his wand on his chest ; a flashing red but nothing happened . 
Rennervate - please - Dumbledore's eyes open slightly ; Harry's heart pounded , Master , teacher ? Water , whispered Dumbledore . Water , Harry sighed tiredly . Yes - It broke and took the cup still inside the pot ; He noticed a pendant inside , wrapped around the cup . Aguamenti ! he shouted , filling the cup with a wand . 
The cup filled with clean water ; Harry went to Dumbledore , picked him up and gave him a drink - but it was completely empty . 
Dumbledore gasped . I have it - wait - Aguamenti ! Harry repeated , pointing his wand at the glass . 
Once again the cup was filled with clean water , but when it reached Dumbledore's mouth it was completely empty . Teacher , I'm trying , I'm trying ! Harry said desperately , whether Dumbledore could hear it or not ; Aguamenti - Agguamenti - AGUAMENTI ! The cup is full of water again . 
Now Dumbledore was breathing weakly . 
Harry thought , only the rest , because Voldemort wanted to ... 
He leaned out of the rock and took the glass to the lake , filling it with cold water that would not disappear . Teacher - here ! Said Harry , trying to drown in Dumbledore's face . That is the only thing it can do , the cold feeling in the arm without the glass is not due to the cold . 
One of the skinny hands was clenched and tried to pull it down from the rock . 
The lake is no longer flat ; Everywhere it is disturbed by heads and white arms appearing from below the water , men , women , and children with deep , dark eyebrows are approaching an island . The army dies from beneath the black water . Petrificus Totalus ! Harry barked , trying to retreat to the edge of the stone just in time to reach the Inferius holding his arm . 
She let go and sank back into the water ; It's got to be standing up , but there's more of an Inferi ready to climb the island . 
The faces of the offerings are glancing at Harry . Petrificus Totalus ! Harry screamed again , pushing back six or seven more names , but more names approached him . Impedimenta ! Incarcerous ! Some stumble , one or two are tied up , but others go on and stomp on the names . 
Still holding the wand , Harry screamed , Sectumsempra ! 
SECTUMSEMPRA ! But in addition to the incision on the skin , they had no blood to flow : they kept moving , no emotion , the arms were moving toward Harry , and as he tried to step back further , he felt the arms cold from behind , it was lifted up , and they took it all away , down the water , feeling that there was no hope of rescuing it anymore , and would become a guardian of the soul . of Voldemort here .... 
But , through the night , a fire appeared , crimson and yellow , a ring of fire surrounding the island , the Inferi clutching Harry staggered and they weakened ; They dare not cross the ring of fire and return to the water . 
They let go of Harry , he was thrown to the ground , with the mace's arm , after which he stood up quickly , raised his wand to the defense . 
Dumbledore is now standing up , as blue as the Inferi around , but higher , the flames glittering in his eyes , his pes as a torch , his head making the rings of fire , like noose , tighten them to the heat . 
The Inferi bump into each other , hopeless to escape them .... 
Dumbledore bent down and picked up the pendant from the bottom of the pot and put it inside the cloak . 
Armed with fire rings , the Inferi do not know that their prey is leaving when Dumbledore and Harry are back inside the boat , the ring of fire follows them , around , the Inferi follow them . when they leave the shore , where they also disappear after dark . 
Harry , very scared , thought that Dumbledore could not climb into the boat , he was a bit stunned when he tried to do it , all his strength was focused on creating a fire ring to protect them . 
Harry takes Dumbledore to his seat . 
When they were safely squeezed tight on the boat , it began to move , the fire ring still surrounded them , and it seemed the Inferi bodies were swimming beneath them but they did not dare to appear . Mister , Harry whispered , I forgot - about calling fire - they attacked and I was frightened - I understand , Dumbledore whispered . 
Harry could hear his weak voice . 
They came back to this side with a small touch of the boat on the rock , Harry climbed down , and quickly turned around to help Dumbledore . 
When Dumbledore had stepped down , he dropped his wand ; The ring of fire disappears , but Inferi's body does not appear anymore . 
The boat sank back into the water , fearing the chains too sank under the lake in clattering . 
Dumbledore sighed and leaned against the cave wall . I'm weak ... He said , " No problem , sir , " said Harry , anxious for his pale and puffy gait . Do not worry , I will bring you home .... 
Based on the child , teacher .... And with his unarmed arm on his shoulders , Harry had a hard time finding the headmaster around the lake to return . The defense was thoughtful , Dumbledore said weakly . One will not do anything .... 
I did very well , very well , Harry .... Do not say teacher , Harry said , Nursing home , teacher .... 
We're leaving here .... The gate was closed .... 
My knife ... No need , I ' ll cut the stone , Harry said soberly . Show me where it is .... Here ... . Harry rubs his wrist on the stone : When he realizes the blood's offering to him , the gate opens again . 
They escape , and Harry helps Dumbledore down the cold water in the tunnel . That's fine , teacher . Harry repeated several times , afraid of his silence , than when he spoke weakly again . We are coming soon .... 
You can lay the ground back for both ... do not worry .... I'm fine , Harry , Dumbledore said , his voice was bigger than the sound of the water . 
I am with you . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 27 The Lightning Tower 
Back at the starry sky , Harry dragged Dumbledore to the nearest rock . 
Shaking and shaking , with the weight of Dumbledore above , it focused hard to the destination : Hogsmeade . 
Closing his eyes , holding Dumbledore's arm tightly , Harry continued his horrible grip . 
Before he opened his eyes , Harry knew he had done it : the smell of sand , the waves had disappeared . 
He and Dumbledore were in the dark path leading to Hosgmeade . 
For a moment , he saw many Inferi slowly approaching him from the shops , but after a blink of an eye they disappeared . 
Around it , there was only darkness with a few luminescent lights . We have arrived , Master Harry said a difficulty . 
It suddenly recognized the stitches in the chest was dry . We came , we came to Horcrux ! Dumbledore staggered in front of him . 
For a moment , Harry thought that its subterfuge had left him unbalanced . 
Then he saw his face , pale and drenched in the light of the distance of the street lamp . I would be better off than Dumbledore saying weakly , though the corner of his mouth tugged . That dose was not an antidote . And when he saw Harry's shudder , he lowered his head . Do not worry , you will be fine . It looks desperately around , but no one . 
All he could think of now was to give Dumbledore all the way to the clinic . We need to go to school , mister ... Mrs. Pomfrey No one says we need Professor Snape now but we do not think we can go that far Yes , teacher . 
I ' ll find a place for you to rest , then I ' ll go find Severus . Dumbledore says we need Severus .. well , Snape . 
But you will have to go for a while , so you can . But before Harry could do anything , he heard footsteps running . 
Its heart jumped : Someone has seen , somebody knows they need help . 
And he saw Rosmerta running down the dark path in front of them with high heels and a silk robe embroidered with dragons . 
We see Turkish terrier pulling the bedroom screen . 
Thank God , thank God , I can not think of anything but what happened to you , Mr. Albus ? She paused , gasping and staring , with her eyes wide open , down to Dumbledore . He was hurt , Harry said Rosmerta , can you bring him to the Three Brooms shop when he goes to school and find help ? 
I can not go there alone , I do not recognize - I do not see .. ? If you help my son , Harry , do not listen to what Rosmerta says you think we can put him in ? 
What happened ? 
Dumbledore said : What happened , Rosmerta ? 
Sign - black sign , instrumental And then she pointed to the sky , toward Hogwarts . 
Fear was in Harry . He looked up . 
It was there , hovering in the sky above the field : the green skull , burning with the serpent's tongue , the sign that the Death Eaters were leaving when they entered the building whenever they killed . Someone It When ? 
asked Dumbledore , and his hand tightened on Harry's shoulder as he struggled to get up . 
It was probably a few minutes ago when I took the cat out without it , but when I went upstairs - ? We need to come back to the castle again , Dumbledore says Rosmerta , and though a little staggering , it's almost entirely up to the person who ordered us to have brooms I have a pair behind her . Say , look very scared I can run away and get - ? No , Harry could do it Harry held up his wand again . Rosmerta's Accio's broom A second later , they heard a loud bang when the front door of the pub broke open , two brooms jutting out the street and They rush to Harry's side , where they stop suddenly , shaking slightly , at the highest speed . 
Rosmerta , please send a letter to the Ministry of Magic Dumbledore said , when he was riding on the nearest broom . Maybe no one in Hogwarts noticed something was wrong . Harry , wearing his invisibility cloak , Stealthy jacket came out of the bag , and wrapped it in the man before climbing up the broom , Rosmetra staggered back to her pub , as Harry and Dumbledore pedaled to the ground and flew up . 
As they accelerated toward the castle , Harry glided past Dumbledore , ready to grab the instrument if it fell , but it seemed the black signal excited him : he lowered himself , eyes staring at the black mark . , his beard and silver hair flew back in the night sky . 
And Harry also looked at the skull , growing scared in it , like a vicious bubble , compressing his lungs , taking all the other worries in his mind . 
Are Ron , Hermione , and Ginny all the same ? 
Does the school or Neville , or Luna or other members of the DA find out who made the black mark ? 
And if he was the one who asked them to patrol the corridors , would he tell them to leave the safe he trusted , again , for the death of a friend ? 
As she flew through the night , circling down the path she had been walking before , despite the hiss of the night air , Harry heard Dumbledore speak in a foreign language . He knew why his broom shake a little as they fly into the yard : Dumbledore has broken the charms that he himself has around the castle , so they can quickly enter the castle . 
The black sign is glittering above the astronomical pyramid , the highest point of the castle . 
Was death already there ? 
Dumbledore just crossed the wall and landed , Harry landed behind him for a few seconds and looked around . 
Empty court . 
The door leads to the spiral staircase leading to the castle being closed . 
There is no sign of a battle to the death or one . What does this mean ? Harry asked Dumbledore , then looked up at the blue skull with the snake's tongue twinkling cruelly . Does it have a black mark ? Must someone identify - teacher ? In the dim light of the black mark , Harry saw Dumbledore clutching his chest with his dark hand . 
walks up to Severus and says weak but clear . Tell him what happened and tell me to come . Do not do anything else , do not tell anyone and do not take off your coat . 
I will wait here . But - 
I swear to follow me , Harry - go away ! Harry rushed to the door leading to the spiral staircase , but his hand had just touched the iron ring of the door when he heard footsteps from the other side . 
He looked over at Dumbledore gesturing for him to step back . 
He just pulled away from the door and pulled out a wand . 
The wings of the tossing and a person appeared , shouted Expelliarmus ! The Harry becomes hard and immobile , and he feels it falls on the wall of the tower , standing like a statue , unable to move or speak . 
He does not know what happened - Expelliarmus is not a frozen curse . 
Then , with the light of the black sign , he saw Dumbledore's wand flying around the bar , and it came to pass that he had been silent for a moment , and the very fact that the curse had made it . You pay the price with the opportunity to defend yourself . facing the edge of the city , Dumbledore had no signs of panic or pain . 
He merely looked at the man who had knocked out his wand and said good evening , Draco Malfoy stepped forward , glancing around to check if anyone else was there . 
His eyes stopped at the second broom . 
Is there anyone else here ? 
That's a question we should ask you , or are you acting alone ? Harry saw Malfoy's pale eyes turn to Dumbledore in the pale blue of the sign he did not say I was angry . 
Death of a Death Eater in your school tonight Well , Dumbledore said , as if Malfoy was presenting an ambitious homework . indeed very well . 
You figured out how to put them in , right ? That's right , Malfoy said , panting just under his nose , which he never recognized . Dumbledore said , " Now , what's going on ? " 
You do not seem to get help . They met his guardians . 
They are underneath each other . They will not be late to go ahead . I - I have a job to do Well , then , you have to manage it yourself , dear boy Dumbledore said gently . 
Then all silence . 
Harry was imprisoned in their stealthy body , paralyzed , staring at them , his ears straining to hear the sound of death eagles from far away , and in front of him , Draco Malfoy Nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore , who , unbelievably , was smiling . Draco , Draco , you're not a killer How did you know ? Malfoy said he seemed to have realized how childish it was , Harry saw him turn red in the blue of the black sign he did not know my ability . Malfoy said stronger than he did not know what I just did . Oh yes , I know Dumbledore said gently he almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley . 
He tried to kill me , with desperation rising , throughout the school year . 
Forgive me , Draco , but that's really a weak effort , honestly , I want to know if your heart really allows it ! Malfoy said fiercely that I did it for the whole school year , and tonight - 
Somewhere deep in the castle below , Harry heard a scream . 
Malfoy froze , then glanced back . 
Someone is fighting a fight or Dumbledore says cheerfully . 
But you are saying yes , you managed to bring the Death Eaters to my school , I admit , I think you can not do that ? But Malfoy did not say anything , he was still listening to what was going on beneath him and he was almost paralyzed like Harry . 
Maybe you have to do this alone Dumnledore said if his men were prevented ? 
You may have noticed , members of the phoenix association are here tonight . 
After all , you really do not need help . Right now , I do not have a wand I have nothing to defend Malfoy still just stare at me . I know he said kindly , when Malfoy did not say a word , he was afraid to do this without me . Malfoy growled , though he did not do anything to Dumbledore himself , so he was afraid ! Why ? 
I do not think you ' ll kill me , Draco . 
Murder is not as easy as innocent trust . So tell us , while we wait for your friends . How did you put them here ? 
It seems that he spent a lot of time planning Malfoy looking like he was fighting with the urge to scream or vomit . 
He choked and took a deep breath , glaring at Dumbledore , his wand pointing to the nearby heart . 
And then , as if he could not help himself , he said I had repaired the vanishing Cabinet that nobody had used for years . 
One Montague was lost last year . 
Aaaah sigh , half moan , Dumbledore's . 
For a moment , his eyes closed . 
Very clever have a pair , I will take it ? The other in Borgin and Burkes Malfoy says they create a kind of corridor between them . 
Montague told me that when he was stranded at Hogwarts , he was locked up in the prison , but occasionally he could hear what was going on in the castle , occasionally hearing what was in the store , as if the Cabinet was in between them . , but no one can hear him . 
He finally surrendered , although he never passed the exam . 
He almost died . 
Everybody thinks it's a good story , but only I realize its meaning - even Borgin does not know - I'm the only one who realizes that it's possible to get into Hogwarts through the Cabinet if I fix it . They are so good Dumbledore whispered , Death Eaters could go from Borgin and Burkes to school to help him with a smart plan , very smart and , as he said , right under my nose , Ừ Malfoy said . 
He seemed to have taken the courage and comfort of Dumbledore's compliment . 
Yes , that's right . But many times he's still not sure if he can fix the cabinet , right ? 
And he used to take a look at the villainous and ugly as he gave us a string of hazards that are certainly wrong . There is only a very thin chance for us to drink that wine , but , you still do not recognize the person behind the item ? 
Malfoy taunted , while Dumbledore was slammed down a bit against the wall , his strength obviously decreasing , and Harry struggled in vain , silent , with the curse tied to it . Actually , I do not see Dumbledore saying I'm sure it's you so why do not you stop me ? Malfoy asked if he had tried , Draco . 
Professor Snape has supervised him on my orders . He did not follow his orders , he promised my mother - of course that's what he said to you , Draco , but - He's a spy . you two , you old fool , he did not work for you , only he thought so We have to disagree , Draco . 
I believe Professor Snape - Well , he has lost his wisdom . Malfoy taunted him to offer to help me - to take all the glory - to take a little action - what are you doing ? You made that bead , was stupid , it could blow everything - But I did not tell him what I did at the request room , he got up tomorrow and everything was done and he will no longer be the man of darkness , he will be nothing compared to me , nothing ! Very well , Dumbledore said softly . Of course , we all like to appreciate our own work , but you must have been an accomplice . 
Someone at Hogsmeade , who can release Katie - aaah Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded , as if he was about to fall asleep . 
of course Rosmerta . 
How long has she been cursed [ Imperius Curse ] ? Finally he realized , right ? Malfoy taunted There was another scream at the bottom , a bit louder than the first . 
Malfoy looked back in awe , then looked back at Dumbledore , who was speaking . Poor Rosmerta was forced to shuffle in the bathroom and handed the bead to any Hogwarts students alone . 
And the jar of honey was , of course , Rosmerta could poison it before she sent it to Slughorn , and believed it would be Christmas present , very clear . 
Mr. Filch is not guilty , of course , thinking of checking Rosmerta's bottle to tell me , how do you contact Rosmerta ? 
I think all the way in and out of the school was monitored by the penny Malfoy said , as if he was forced to keep saying , even though the wand in his hand was shaking violently I had one and She has one and I can send messages to her - is not that the secret way of contacting the group that is called Dumbledore's army [ DA ] ? asked Dumbledore . 
The voice was soft and cheerful , but Harry saw him slide down an inch when he spoke . 
Yes , we got the idea from them , Malfoy said , with a grim smile we took the idea of ​​ the poison bottle from Granger's bloody mud , we hear the little girl say , in the library , the poison that Filch does not recognize . Please do not use derogatory words in front of me . Dumbledore says Malfoy grinning . He cares about me saying that bloody mud when I want to kill him ? Dumbledore said , and Harry saw his leg slip a little on the floor when he tried to stand upright . But when he was about to kill Draco , it took him a long time . 
We are alone 
I have no ability to defend at any time , and you still do not act Malfoy's mouth is not distracted , as if he had just tasted something so bitter . Now , about tonight Dumbledore continues to be a little confused about what has happened . 
How did you know I was leaving school ? 
But of course , answering his own question , Rosmerta saw me leave , she told him with his pennies , yes Malfoy said but she said he just went out to drink a bit , then You will come back .. Well , I definitely had a drink and I turned back to mumbling . 
So you decided to set the trap ? We decided to put the Black Sign above the tower and let him come here faster , so he could see the murdered man Malfoy said And it succeeded Well yes and no Dumbledore said But I came , who was killed ? Someone died , and Malfoy said , and his voice seemed to grow a little louder . one of his men . 
I'm not who it was , it was very dark I walked across the body I was ordered to wait here when he came back , his Phoenix was on this road right Dumbledore said There are screams and screams below , larger than before ; It sounds like someone is fighting on a twisted staircase , the stairs leading to where Dumbledore , Malfoy and Harry are standing . 
And Harry's heart thrashed in his invisible cage . Someone died . Malfoy walked through the corpse but who was it ? Have a short time , one way or another Dumbledore said So we talk about your options , Draco My choice ! Malfoy says I'm standing here with a magic wand - I'm going to kill him - dear boy , we will not pretend that . 
If you were going to kill me , you did it when you knocked off my wand , you would not stop for the cheerful chat about this method and meaning . I had no choice , Malfoy said , and he as white as Dumbledore . 
I have to do ! 
He ' ll kill me ! 
He will kill my whole house ! I see the difficult position of the Dumbledore says Do not you think why did not I confront you before ? 
Because I know you will be killed if Voldemort realizes that I suspect Malfoy frowned at the name I did not dare to talk to him about the task that I know he was delivered , if He put the Legilimency on him . continue but now in the end we can also talk frankly with each other . no damage at all , he did not hurt anyone , although he was lucky when his victims accidentally alive . Can you help me , Draco , you can not Malfoy say , his chopsticks are shaking badly , no one can help me . 
He told me to do it otherwise he would kill me . I have no right to choose to return to the right , Draco . 
And we will hide you more perfectly than you can imagine . 
Moreover , I will give the members of the Association to hide his mother tonight . 
Now your dad is safe in Azkaban when it's time to protect him back , Draco ... he's not Malfoy's killer staring at him , but I've gone too far , right ? he said slowly . They think I'm going to die , but I'm here , and you're under my power I'm the one with your wand that needs my kindness , Draco Dumbledore said Now my kindness , no Your right , meaningful Malfoy did not say . 
His mouth opened , his chopsticks still shaking . 
But the sound of footsteps echoed on the stairs and a second behind Malfoy was knocked over when four men in black robes exploded the door on the edge of town . 
Still motionless , Harry watched in horror at the four of them : the Death Eaters seemed to have won the battle at the bottom . 
A humpback man , tilted to the side , and Dumbledore was cornered ! he said , and he turned around to the little woman who looked like his sister , grinning Dumbledore without chopsticks , Dumbledore alone ! 
Very well done , Draco , Very good Hello , Mr. Dycledore , bravely said Ambrous , as if welcoming him to the tea party and he also brought Alecto very gracefully . Think of that little joke that will help him escape from death ? joking joke ? 
No , no , that's the polite way Dumbledore responds . Take away the one closest to Harry , a fat man with long , long hair , a black cloak . 
He had a voice that Harry had never heard : a coughing voice . 
Harry could smell a strong odor mixed with sweat and , more infallible , blood from him . 
Dirty fingers with slightly yellow nails . 
Is that you , Fenrir ? Dumbledore was right , another said , Nice to meet me , Dumbledore ? No , I can not say that , Fenrir Greyback smiled , pointed at the sharp teeth . 
Little blood dripped down his chin and he licked his lips slowly , a dirty way . But you do not know how much we like them , Dumbledore now he attacked even without a round ? 
this is not normal Do you need to eat meat once a month does not satisfy you ? That's right Greyback says It does not he Dumbledore ? 
Does it scare him ? 
Well , I can not pretend it does not scare me a bit , Dumbledore said and , yes , I'm surprised when Draco invited him , of all people , to the school where all his friends were living . I did not invite Malfoy whispered . 
He did not look at Greyback , he did not even seem to , glanced at Greyback . I did not know he was coming - I did not want to miss a visit to Hogwarts , Dumbledore à Greyback said . Out . 
Delicious , very tasty . And he put a yellow nail up and flossed the front teeth , while he was glaring at Dumbledore . He could make a side dish for me , Dumbledore .. No fourth death eater . . 
He has a big , evil face . We have been ordered . 
Draco must do it . 
Draco , hurry up Malfoy seems less determined . 
He looked horrified as he stared at her face , pale as it was and lower than usual , as he slid down the wall of the wall . He does not need this world anymore , if you ask me ! he was leaning to tell the old woman , Seeing him away - what happened to her , Dumby ? Oh , weaker resistance , slower reflexes , Ambrose Dumbledore said Old Age , in a nutshell .. one day , maybe , it would have come to him if he was lucky he was ? The death of a real spirit is suddenly shouting , strong It is always , yes , Dumby , say and do nothing , nothing , I do not know why Dark Lord did not sad to kill him ! 
Come on Draco , do it . But right then , there is a voice from the fight below and a voice shouting They blocked the stairs - Reducto ! 
REDUCTO ! Harry's heart jumped : Those four did not kill all those who resisted them , only 
Go up to the tower , and , as it has heard , they only create Draco's hurdles , hurry up the man with the cruel face saying angrily . 
But Malfoy's hands were trembling so hard that he could not exactly aim to make Greyback roar , and he headed for Dumbledore with his open hand , wide open . I say no ! the man with his cruel face shouted ; the light flashed and the werewolf burst , hit the shore and then he staggered , looking very angry . 
Harry's heart pounded so hard that he could hear and know that he was standing there , trapped by Dumbledore's curse - if he could move , he could have been aiming at a cloak under his invisibility cloak . Draco , do it , or you are no longer with us - the woman hissed , but right then , the door burst open again and Snape stood there , clutching his wand in his hand , when Dumbledore's eyes were leaning against the wall to four death squads , including the werewolf , and Malfoy we had a problem , Snape Amycus said many humps , eyes and wand pointed . At Dumbledore , the boy seemed unlikely - but one of Snape's callers , mildly gentle . Severus The sound made Harry more frightened than anything he had experienced tonight . 
For the first time , Dumbledore begged Snape not to say anything , only to step forward and push Malfoy . 
Three Death Eaters step back . 
Even the wolf seemed scared . Snape looked at Dumbledore , and there was a change , the hiccups appeared on the rough lines of his face . Severus asked Snape to bring the chopsticks up and point it to him . Dumbledore Avada Kedavra ! A blue ray shot from Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore's chest . 
Harry's screams were not heard , silent and unable to budge , he was forced to stand watching Dumbledore being thrown over : in half a second he seemed to be hanging under the glowing head , and then The instrument falls slowly , like a doll , through the maivà hole and fly out . 
Chapter 28 The Prince's Flight 
Harry felt as if he himself was thrown through the air . 
But that did not happen , maybe it did not happen to him Out of here , hurry up ! Snap instructed and flung Malfoy's neck and handed it over to the front door of the racks ; Greyback and the low friends followed ; Only the last pair of panting gasps in agitation . 
As they vanished through the door , Harry suddenly realized it could move again ! What has kept it paralyzed with walls so far ? 
Something is not magical but really horrible in Harry's mind . 
He flipped his Invisibility T - shirt aside while the vicious Death Eater was disappearing through the door . " Petrificus Totalus ! " Suddenly , the Deathly Hallows was as if he had just touched something 
solid and falling to the ground , then stiff as a waxy figure , but he was only near the floor when Harry climbed over him and ran down the dark stairs . 
The pain , the fear , all torn Harry's heart Harry had to go to Mr. Dumbledore and arrest Snape . 
In a way these two things are intimately related . It would be possible to reverse the bad things that had happened if it had done both . And then , maybe , Dumbledore would not die . traverses the last ten steps of the twisted staircase and stands on the legs with the wand ready . 
The corridor was dimly lit with trash and ashes . The top of the house was collapsed in half , and the wall was scaly . 
A fierce battle took place in front of him , but as soon as he tried to guess who was fighting with him , the harsh plastic voice spoke clearly : Finished , let's go ! . it's Snape . 
He disappeared at the end of the corridor , along with Malfoy . 
Just as Harry was chasing after them , one of the fighters freed himself from the fight and rushed over to it - the werewolf Fenrir . 
He was on top of Harry before Harry could react . 
She fell backward , her hair tangled on her face , the unpleasant odor of the sweat and the sneer of blood spilling in her mouth , and the breath that filled her throat . " Petrificus Totalus ! " Harry saw Fenrir collapse in front of him , with a magical attempt to get rid of the werewolf's corpse and lie on the floor as a green light flashed through it . 
She slammed her head down and avoided running towards the fight . 
It touches something soft and slippery . 
It stumbles . 
There are two people lying there , face down puddle of blood but it does not have much time to look . 
Harry realizes that his red hair was fluttering like fire : Ginny was trapped in the battle with the real Death Eater named Amycus . 
He rushes Ginny at the same time , causing Ginny to dodge constantly . 
But Amycus giggled and looked amused at the game ... Crucio , Crucio - you can not dance like that , girl ... Impedimenta ! Harry shouted . 
Curse in the middle of the chest Amycus . 
He squealed a painful sound like a pig , and his feet flickered off the ground like a rocket leaving the pedestal and thrashed against the opposite wall , sliding down like a piece of cloth and out of sight behind Ron . , Prof . McGonalgall and Lupine . 
They are fighting valiantly with the remaining Death Eaters . 
A little too far , Harry could see Tonks fighting with a massive blond magician launching curses from every direction , to the extent that they hit in and out , breaking the rock and making the window the closest shattered . Harry , where are you now ? Ginny had a hearty cry but did not have time for Harry to answer her . 
He clawed his head down and ran all the way forward , away from the spell blades on his head and falling like rain on the wall . 
Snape can not escape , and it must catch him ! He McGonagall screamed , for a moment , Harry caught a glimpse of a Death Eater , Alecto , running all the way through the linen corridor with his arms covered with his brother next to him . 
Harry followed him , but his feet , again , encountered something , and for a moment he realized he was falling over a leg . 
Looking around it realized Neville's pale face was falling on the floor . Neville , you still .... 
Oh ... I'm fine , Neville said softly while holding his stomach , hurry up Harry , Snape and Malfoy just ran over and .... I know , and I'm on the way to catch them ! Harry said and aimed a spell from the floor at the blonde eater , who had caused the most turmoil ever . 
The man cried out in pain in the middle of his face . 
He turned around uncertainly , staggered , staggered and then followed the other . 
Harry crawled on the floor and straightened up , running down the corridor , ignoring the beatings of the sky , the chants of his companions , and the croaking cry of the floor . fate is only like a thousand pounds hanging hair ... 
He stopped at the end of the corridor , where his shoes were sliding away with blood . 
Snape kept a great advantage . 
Did he reach the Needle , or are they still passing through the traps that Order created to stop the Death Eaters in case they escaped by the road ? 
He could hear nothing but footsteps on the stone floor , his heart pounding as he ran through the empty hallway . 
Next , it suddenly found a bloody footprint that showed that at least one Death Eater was hiding toward the door - perhaps the Essential Room was actually locked . 
It crossed the corners of the next corridor . 
Suddenly , a curse flew through it . 
He hides behind a set of armor that has exploded . 
He saw people running down the front marble stairs and aiming a spell at them , but only hit a few witches with wigs in a portrait hanging from the top of the stairs , causing them to squeak and steal . on the next picture . 
As it jumped over the debris of the armor , it heard more yells , more bangs , more screams . 
The others in the castle looked awake . 
He squeezed his leg against his neck and ran into a shortcut in hopes of catching up with the others and getting closer to Snape and Malfoy . 
They must have reached the ground now . 
Jumping through the invisible steps halfway down the hidden staircase , he landed on a rug on the ground and outside the village where some Hufflepuff students wore panties . Harry ! 
They hear the noise , and then someone talks about the Signs of Black again ! Ernie Macmillan says Get out ! Harry said and pushed the boys out to run to the top of the stairs and down the rest of the marble stairs . 
The door was blown up , and there were blood stains on the paving stones . 
Some of the students looked horrified and gathered together at the wall , some of them sat cringing with arms covering their heads . 
The huge sand clock counts for the Gryffindor , with many curses shattering , and some of the ruby ​​ inside is still falling out on the rocks with a tinkling sound . 
Harry crosses the Hall and into the darkness of the front of the castle . 
It can recognize three shapes crossing the lawn , toward the far side of the gate . 
He saw the blond Death Eater , and before him Snape and Malfoy ... 
They will be able to get through the door ! 
The cold , frosty night air hit Harry's face and slammed into his lungs as he walked quickly and tore through the breeze . 
He saw a flash of light from far away , shining it under the damp ground immediately . 
Harry did not know if he should run or was close enough to aim for a deadly curse ... 
Another flash , then screams , then the light flashes back . 
Harry understood : Hagrid stood out in the middle of the hut and looked like he was trying to stop a Death Eater from escaping . 
Though every breath seemed to tear apart his lungs , though his chest was as hot as a furnace , Harry accelerated with his own heart that it was not Hagrid . 
Something hit Harry from behind , causing it to dart forward , his face pounding on the ground , blood spilling from both nostrils . 
He knew , as soon as it rolled , the wand in his hand was ready , and the people he had just crossed used the same shortcut as he was right behind him ... Impedimenta ! He shouted while rolling again , crouching near the black ground and wondering how his spell hit one of them . 
He stumbles and falls and bumps into the others , causing the party to fall . 
Harry jumped and continued running towards Snape . 
And now it was clear that Hagrid's shapely shape was illuminated by the illuminated crescent moon but had been obscured by dark clouds as the sign of the darkness of the darkness of the sky . 
The death of the golden eagle still echoing the curse and the curse of the keeper ; But the strength and skin that Hagrid inherited from the giant mother seems to be protecting him . 
Snape and Malfoy , however , are still running fast . 
With this momentum they will pass through the gate and can be able to fill the ground ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
Harry surpassed Hagrid and his opponent , targeting Snape's back and shouting : Stupefy ! How long did it take : a flash of red light over Snape's head . 
He turned around , saw Harry and shouted : Run fast to Draco ! and turn around . 
At 20 yards apart , he and Harry looked at each other , in the cold breeze , in the rustling of leaves , in the faint moonlight , and throwing wands at the same time . 
Cru ... But Snape managed to curse and hit Harry up in the sky before Harry could finish the curse . 
He turned around and crawled out after the Death Eater shouted : Incendio ! Harry heard a blast of landslide , then the orange jumps on the ground : Hagrid's hut was burning . Fang is in it , the devil ! Hagrid roars on Cru ... Harry shouted again and pointed to the figure illuminated by the fire in front , but Snape was still blocking Harry's dharma . 
Then , he laughed , laughing at the scorn , laughing at Harry . There is no unforgivable curse from you who can hit me , Potter ! He screamed in the fire . 
Meanwhile , Hagrid still screams , crying over the screams of Fang's panic : You have no conscience ... 
Incarc ... Harry screamed , but Snape had deflected with a lazy hand swipe . 
Harry said in the wind Retaliate ! 
Why do not you fight back cowardice ? Cowards , we Potter ? 
Your father has not attacked me , never if he has no friends nearby . 
Will you call him that , I'm wondering here ? STUPE ... Block and block , I ' ll block your attack until you know how to keep the mouth of the mouth of Potter ! He said again and blamed him . 
Then he shouted at the Death Eater on his back . Harry : Now let's go , before the nose sets up . 
IMPEDI .... But before he had finished speaking , a great pain overwhelmed Harry , causing him to roll in the grass . 
Someone is screaming , hearing , pain , it can die because of this pain . 
Snape was torturing him , torturing him ... No ! Old Snape shouted . 
The pain of it stopped , suddenly as it began . 
Harry curled up on the grass , grabbing his wand next to him . 
A voice from Snape's head said , Did you forget our command ? 
Potter belongs to the Dark Lord . 
Leave it there and go ! scat ! And Harry felt the ground vibrate beneath his face . 
Great Death Eaters obey the command above , run to the gate . 
Harry made an angry noise . 
At that moment , Harry does not care whether he will live or die . 
Trying to get up in the last attempt , she staggers and walks blindly toward Snape , who is now as hostile as Voldemort once hated . 
" Sectum .... 
" Snape snapped his wand and the curse was pushed back , but Harry was only a foot away and could finally see his face . 
He did not laugh anymore , and the flashes of light showed the face full of anger and anger . 
Highly focused on all the power of attention , Harry thought , Levi .... No , Potter ! Snape screamed . 
Then a loud explosion and Harry flew up again , jerking back and forth , banging on the ground . 
This time , his wand slipped out of his hand . 
It might have been Hagrid's voice , the loud fang in the fire house as Snape approached and looked down upon it , a man with no wand and helplessness as Dumbledore had been . 
Snape's rejuvenated face lit up in the fire of the hut emerging from his anger , his mute resentment as it had been before he'd drowned Dumbledore . Do you dare to use my spell against me Potter ? 
I created them - I , Prince Hybrid ! 
That's me ! 
And you use an invention on the inventor itself , like your filthy father ? 
I do not think so ... 
Non - stop ! ! It was Harry jumping down to grab his wand . 
Snape shot a spell into the wand , spreading it away , swallowed by the darkness , and out of sight . Kill me ! Harry whispered without fear in spite of contempt and anger . Kill me as if you had killed the old man ! No ... Snape screamed , and he suddenly went mad and inhuman as if he were in pain like a roaring dog , barking at the house behind them ... calling me cowardice ! Then he wiped the air between them with his wand . that's a curse . 
Harry felt like a hot whip hurled across his face and fell to the ground behind him . 
Many spots explode right in front of him , then momentarily , as if life had left him . 
He heard many fluttering wings above his head , and something huge obscured the stars above . 
Buckbeak attacks Snape . 
The old man jerked backward , his razor sharp claws sharpening him . 
As Harry sat up himself , his head was still circling since it hit the ground . 
He noticed that Snape was running all night , because the giant monster still fluttered behind him and hissed louder than he had ever hissed before . 
Harry struggled with the legs of the season , looking around to find the wand to continue the hunt for the gods , but as soon as his fingers clawed at the grass , Throwing away the baby branches that it thought was the wand itself found that it was too late . 
When he found the precious wand , he only saw the Equator fly around the door . 
Snape had managed to subdue just outside the boundary of the sorcerer's school . Hagrid ! Harry whispered in shock , looking around calling out HAGRID ? She ran to the burning hut at a distance when a huge figure appeared from the fire , on the shoulders of Fang groaning . 
A tearful stream of tears poured out of Harry's jade eyes , which knelt down , helpless . 
Her limbs are not strong enough , her body aches in all places , and her breath is painful , because her nose is hurt and bleeding ... How are you , Harry ? 
Are you OK ? 
Talk to Harry , say .... Hagrid , with his bearded face flashing in front of him and covering his eyes . 
Harry smelled of burning wood , the smell of dog hair . 
It brought the helpless arm away to feel the warmth of Fang and a living body trembling beside it . I'm fine , okay ... all . 
Uncle ? of course . 
It takes more than that to finish ! 
Hagrid wrapped his arms around Harry and lifted it up with the force of a momentary stiffness that was no longer attached to the ground before he dropped it . 
He could see blood flowing down Hagrid's cheeks from a deep cut under his swollen eye . We should put out the fire , says Harry , the ' Aguamenti ' will .... I've known it , Hagrid stuttered , then raised a smoldering pink umbrella and shouted : Aguamenti . 
A stream of water from the tip of the umbrella . 
Harry held up his arm as heavy as the chopsticks he was holding up and said : Aguamenti . 
Together , it and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished . A few minutes later , he looked at the ruins , smirking in hopeful light : It was not so bad . is not it Harry ? 
Nothing is Dumbledore can not do ... 
Harry felt a chill when he heard that name . 
In the silence and silence , the horror unfolds in itself ... " Hagrid ... " I was working when I heard them , Hagrid said sadly , his eyes still on the ruined hut . All the trees , poor ... " Hagrid ... " But what happened Harry ? 
We see them , Death Eaters , run down from the castle . 
But what the hell did Snape do with them ? 
Where are you going ? Elder chasing them ? Harry ... I learned from him . 
It has dried up since now because of the smoke and the fear . Hagrid , you killed ... killed ? Hagrid says loudly and stares at Harry Snape for killing ? 
What are you talking about , Harry ? Dumbledore ... 
Snape killed , Dum - ble - dore ... ... ... Hagrid looked at him , part of a dull face , and did not seem to understand the problem . " Dumbledore , Harry ? " 
Snape killed you ... do not say that ! Harry says rude Snape killed him ? Do not be fooled by Harry . What makes you say that ? I saw him kill you ... You could not see that ! You see , Hagrid ! Hagrid shook his head . 
He did not believe , but pity Harry . 
Harry knew that Hagrid thought he was the only side effect of the spells , that he was being tricked . What really happened , Dumbledore said Snape with the Death Eaters Hagrid confidently said I hope he still holds his cover . 
Come on , I have to take you back to school . Come on Harry ... Harry is not trying to explain or argue at all . 
He is still so untouched . 
Hagrid himself will find the truth soon , too soon . 
As they walked straight to the castle , Harry saw that many of the windows had lights . 
He clearly imagined the scene was in it . 
People ran from room to room , telling each other that the Death Eaters had entered , that the Sign had emitted in Hogwarts , and that someone had been killed . 
The oak door is still open in front . 
The light spilled out on the front lawn . 
Slowly and uncertainly , many in their robes crept down the stairs , looking worried about the signs the Death Eaters had left behind . 
However , Harry looked up at the tallest tower . 
He imagined that he saw a black man lying there , in the grass , far too far away so he could really see something . 
At the same time it looked silent to where it was thinking . 
Dumbledore's body was still there and Harry noticed that everyone was starting to turn to him . What are you looking at ? Hagrid said as he and Harry touched the castle steps . 
Fang held himself close to Hagrid's leg . 
What's on that grass ? 
Added Hagrid , toward the astronomical pyramid where a small crowd gathered . See not Harry ? 
At the foot of the tower ? 
Under the sign of black ... 
Oh , do you think anyone can pass ? 
Harry was silent , his thoughts were too terrifying to reveal . 
Harry walked with him , feeling the pain in his face and thighs that the various spells had hit him half an hour ago , though it was in a crowd as if someone near him was smashing it . 
Something true and undeniable is hurting it in the spirit . 
It and Hagrid went , like a dream , through a crowd before , where many students and teachers were dumbfounded to make room . 
He heard Hagrid's grief and agitation , but it did not stop . He walked slowly forward until he reached the place where he was lying . 
Harry knew that there was no hope any longer since the moment that the Blasphemous Torture was placed on him , knowing that it might have happened just because the magician had died . 
But it was not prepared to see him lying there , the greatest wizard Harry ever had and would never see . 
His eyes were closed , but his lying position made people just think that he was in the dream . 
Harry adjusted to the missing glasses like the moon on the other high above the curved nose and then clean the blood on the surface with the sleeves . 
Then he stared at the old , but wise and wise face , and tried to accept the truth and could hardly believe that he would never talk to Harry again , never again . 
the crowd whispered behind Harry . 
After a long period of time , he realized it was kneeling on a rather hard object . 
He looked down . 
A metal box that they wanted to mow long hours had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket . 
The box was opened , probably because the impact was so strong on the ground . 
And as soon as she did not feel weak or scared or upset , Hary knew , when she picked up the box , he knew there was something wrong . 
He turned the box on his wrist . 
This is not as big as it is remembered in the Potsdam , or not marked on the lid . 
There is no sign of the S decorated as splendid as the Slytherin symbol . 
Moreover , nothing inside except a small piece of parchment paper loose at the position of a portrait as normal . 
Automatically and unaware of what he was doing , Harry pulled out a piece of parchment , stayed in it , and read in the light of many wands lit in the back of it all the time . 
To The Dark Lord I died long before you read this , but I wanted to know that I had discovered the secret of the day myself . 
I stole Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as possible . 
I faced death in the hope that when he entered the final battle he would be destroyed again . 
R . A . B Harry does not know and does not need to know anything . 
Only one thing is important : it's not Horcrux . 
Dumbledore had weakened himself with that illicit drink that had nothing . 
Harry tormented the piece of paper in his hands , and 
Surface water spilling out of the jade blue eyes . 
He cried . 
Behind him , Fang spat out a long , mournful sound . 
harry potter and the Prince 
Chapter 29 All the Pharaohs 
Come on , Harry No I can not stay here , Harry .... get up ... 
No It does not want to leave Dumbledore here , he does not want to go anywhere . 
Hagrid's hand on his shoulders trembling . 
Then another voice came up : Harry , let's go . A little warmer hand took Harry's hand and pulled it away . 
It follows without really thinking at all . 
It was only through the crowd that he realized , through a breath of fresh air , that it was Ginny who was taking it to the castle . 
But voices rushed to his head , sobs , screams and groans ripped through the night , but Harry and Ginny continued on , up the steps leading to the hall . 
The faces swimming in front of Harry's eyes , looking , whispering , and the Gryffindor rubies glittering on the floor like drops of blood as they fade to the marble stairs . We will go to Ginny's disease , you will not get hurt . Harry says it's McGonagall's request . Ginny goes on . Everyone is there , Ron , Hermione , Lupine and all the others - Fear . Harry spilled onto Harry's chest again : It had forgotten the immobile body that had left behind . Ginny , who else died ? Do not worry , there's none of us . But the sign of darkness - Malfoy says it's a human - He's tripped up with Bill , but he's okay , but in Ginny's voice there's something , Let it know that there will be casualties . Are you sure ? Of course I'm sure .... 
he is ... 
Oh , it's a little tear , but only that . 
Greyback attacked him . Mrs. Pomfrey said ... he would look ... would not be the same anymore . Ginny's voice shook . People do not really know what the consequences will be , I mean , Greyback is a werewolf , but he has not changed yet . But what about the others ? 
There are still other bodies on the floor .... Neville and Flitwick were both injured , but Mrs Pomfrey said they would be fine . 
And a Death Eater . 
He was hit by a deadly curse and that huge blonde hair splashed everywhere . 
Harry , if we do not have a bottle of his Felix , I think we have been killed , but it seems that all of them just passed ... They both went to sickness . 
Opening the door , Harry saw Neville lying , probably sleeping , on a bed near the window . 
Ron , Hermione , Luna , Tonks and Lupine are ringing around another bed near the back of the room . 
When they heard the door open , they all looked up . 
Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him , and Lupine stepped forward , her face too 
anxious . Are you okay , Harry ? I'm fine ... 
Bill what ? Nobody answered . 
Harry looked over at Hermione's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face on Bill's pillow , torn so badly that he looked ugly . 
Pomfrey was lightly rubbing his wounds with a tinge of green ointment . 
Harry suddenly remembered that Snape had easily cured the wounds of the curse of Sectumsempra with his wand . Can not you cure these marks with spells or something else ? He asked the nurse . There were no spells that worked well with these marks , she said . I tried all the things I know , but there was no way to cure the wolf's bites . But he was not bitten at full moon . Ron said , looking down at his brother's face as if it could cure him . All from just by looking at that . Greyback has not changed yet , so it is unlikely that Bill will really be - He looks at Lupine with uncertainty . No , I do not think Bill would be a real wolf , Lupine said , but that does not mean that there will not be a change . These are the wounds that have been cursed . 
They seem to never fully recover , and - Bill will probably carry a few wolves , from now on Dumbledore will probably know something . Ron said where was he ? 
Bill fought with those crazy people at his command . 
Dumbledore owes him , he can not leave him in this state ! Ron - Dumbledore lost Ginny said no ! Lupine looks from Ginny to Harry with a wild look , hoping that he ' ll tell her the wrong way , but when Harry's still standing , Lupine drops himself in a chair by Bill's bed , arms folded . 
Previously Harry had never seen Lupine lose control , it felt like it was breaking into something private . 
He turned away and caught Ron's look , quietly exchanging a glance with him to confirm what Ginny had said . What does it take ? Whispered Tonks . What happened ? Snape killed Harry and said he was standing there watching . 
They both turned to the Astronomical Observatory because that was where the Dark Sign appeared . 
Dumbledore was injured , and very weak , but I think he realized it was a trap when they heard footsteps running down the stairs . 
I could not do anything and was wearing an invisibility cloak - and then Malfoy stepped through the door , stripped of his wand . - Hermione put her hand to her mouth , Ron roared . 
Luna's lips trembled . 
Death Eaters - and then Snape - and Snape did it . 
Avada Kedavra . Harry could not say anymore . 
Mrs. Pomfrey burst into tears . 
No one noticed her except Ginny , she whispered to Shh ! 
Listen ! Mrs. Pomfrey just hushed her fingers to her mouth , her eyes wide . somewhere beyond the dark sky , a phoenix singing in a way that Harry had never heard , a mournful song . 
And Harry felt , as before , he had felt when listening to the phoenix song , that the music was coming from within him : that the pain of his own had miraculously been sung , the courtyard and through the windows of the castle . 
They have been sitting there listening for so long , they do not know , as well as how their belts seem to relax when they sit there , listening to their own cries , but it seems like a long time after the sick door . and Professor McGonagall entered the room . 
Like all the others , she also had the wounds of the battle : her face was covered with scratches , and her tunic was torn . Molly and Arthur are on their way . She said , and the magic of the song ended . 
Everyone stood up as if waking up to the dream , turned to look at Bill or rubbed his eyes , shaking his head . Harry , what happened ? 
Hagrid said that I was with Dumbledore when he was ... when that happened . 
He also said that Professor Snape also joined in a few - Snape killed Dumbledore , Harry said . 
She looked at Harry for a moment , then trembled horribly . 
Mrs. Pomfrey , seemingly calmed down , ran to her and took out a chair from the air , laying down for Miss McGonagall . Snape , Miss McGonagall , recalls weakly , dropping herself into a chair . 
We all wonder .... 
But he always believed ... always . 
Snape .... 
Unbelievable ... . Snape was an extremely tight joker , Lupine said , his voice hard to hear and very strange . We always knew that . But Dumbledore swore he was on our side ! ! I always thought that Dumbledore knew something about Snape that we did not know ... You always said you had a sure reason to trust Snape Professor McGonagall had just said a little wipe his eyes were smudged with a handkerchief . I mean ... with Snape's profile .... Of course people will doubt .... 
But Dumbledore convinced me that Snape was really repentant ... No word yet against him ! I wish I knew what Snape had said to convince him , Tonks said . I know , Harry replied , and all turned to look at him . Snape had given Voldemort the news that had caused Voldemort to kill his parents . 
And then Snape told Dumbledore that he did not realize what he had done , that he was sorry for doing it , regretting that they had died . Everyone looked at it . And Dumbledore believed that ? Asked Lupine , suspiciously . Dumbledore believed that Snape felt sorry that James had died ? 
Snape hates James ... And he thinks that his mother is not worth anything . Harry says that Muggle - born mummy calls him so .... No one asked how Harry knew it . 
All of them seemed to be in terrible shock about what had happened . 
All is my fault . Professor McGonagall suddenly said . 
She looked completely disoriented , her hands twisted wet handkerchief . My error . 
I told Filius to call Snape tonight , I called him here to help us ! 
If I did not tell Snape what was going on , he never came to help the Death Eaters . 
I do not think he knew them there before Filius told him , I do not think he knew they were coming . That's not your fault , Minerva à Lupine said firmly . We all want to be helped , and we're glad Snape is on his way . So when he came to the battle , he joined the Death Eaters ? Harry wanted to know all the details of Snape's betrayal and the two sides , anxious to find more reasons to hate him , to be determined to take revenge . I do not know exactly how things went , Professor McGonagall said absently . All tangled up .... 
Dumbledore told us that he would leave the school for a few hours , and that he would have to patrol the corridor , in case of necessity . 
Remus , Bill , Nymphadora will also join us , and 
So I patrol . 
All the secret pathways out of the school were blocked . 
We know no one can fly in . 
Very powerful spells are cast on every entrance to the castle . 
I still do not know how the Death Eaters could reach ... I know , Harry said , and gave a brief explanation of the two mobile rooms as well as the magic path they created . And they went through the requesting room . It seemed to immediately look at Ron and Hermione , who both looked tired . I do not understand , Harry Ron said miserable . We did as he said : We checked the map of the robber and did not see Malfoy there , so we thought it must be in the requested room , so I , Ginny and Neville came to watch over it . ... 
But Malfoy got past these guys . It came out of the room about an hour after we started looking out for Ginny saying , " It's alright , hold on to that scary , dry hand . " illuminate the person holding it , remember ? Anyway , Ginny continued . Surely he always checked to see if it was safe to lead the Death Eaters , because when he saw us , he threw something into the air , and then It was dark as ink . - Powder to create the dark instant Ron said bitter Fred and George . 
Maybe I ' ll have to talk to the two of them about letting people buy . We tried everything , Lumos , Incendio , Ginny went on . But nothing went through that darkness ; All we can do is open the way to the corridor . 
Obviously , Malfoy could see that the hand had led them ; But we did not dare use any curse or anything else for fear of mating , and when we reached the corridor in the morning they were gone . Luckily , Lupine spoke thickly Ron , Ginny and Neville . Meet us almost immediately and tell us what happened . 
A few moments later we found the Death Eaters walking in the direction of the Heavenly Tower . 
By default , Malfoy did not anticipate that there would be more watchers , it seemed to have run out of shade . 
When a battle broke out , they ran scattered and we had to chase . 
One of them , Gibbon , escaped and up the stairs leading up to the tower - to call the Dark Sign ? Harry asked . Surely he called , yes , they must have arranged it before they left the room . Lupine replied . But he did not think Gibbon liked the idea of ​​ standing alone for Dumbledore on it , since he then ran down the stairs to return to battle and hit the deadly curse that had just hit him . . If Ron was watching the room with Ginny and Neville , Harry continued , turning to Hermione . Outside Snape's office , Hermione whispered , her eyes sparkling . 
along with Luna . 
We have been around for a long time and nothing happened . 
We did not know what was going on upstairs , Ron kept the map ... 
Near midnight , Professor Flitwick ran down to the basement . 
He screams about the Death Eaters in the castle , I do not think he really realized that he and Luna were there , he just rushed straight into Snape's office and we heard him . That Snape had to go back to the teacher to help and then we heard a loud noise , and Snape rushed out of the room , and he saw us - and - Why ? Harry urged her . I'm a fool , Harry Hermione whispered in a high pitched voice . He said Professor Flitwick was shocked and we had to go to look after him while he was - 
while he came to help people fight the Death Eaters - She embraced her face in shame , so her voice was not clear . We went into his office to see if Professor Flitwick could help me a little . see him lying unconscious on the floor .... 
Now , it's clear , Snape's got a point at Flitwick , but we do not recognize him , Harry , we do not recognize , we've let Snape go ! It's not Lupine's fault to say Hermione's ass , if you do not listen to Snape and stay away from him , maybe he ' ll kill you and Luna . Then he goes upstairs to Harry , imagine Snape was running up the marble stairs , his black robes fluttering behind him as always , drawing his wand as he approached , and he found where everyone was fighting ... We Trouble , we almost lost the battle , Tonks said Gibbon fell , but it seems that all the Death Eaters are willing to fight to death . 
Neville was injured , and Bill was attacked by Greyback . 
All are dark ... curses fly everywhere . 
The Malfoy kid has disappeared , it is definitely gone and run up . 
And then another name followed , but one guy blocked the stairs with a spell . 
Neville ran in and was thrown into the air - Neither of us could get over it . Ron continued . And that damn Death Eater continued to shoot the curse everywhere , banging on the wall , shooting back . And just across the gang .... And then Snape came to say Tonks And he did not ... I saw him run over us , but the giant Death Eater immediately cursed to hit me , I have to avoid and forget everything , Ginny I saw him run through the vow as there was nothing there Lupine said I tried running after him , but was knocked back like Neville .... He must have known a mantra that we did not Miss McGonagall at the end - he is also a Black Martial Arts teacher ... 
I thought he was chasing the Death Eaters who ran to the tower . He did , Harry said furiously but to help them , not to stop them ... 
And the fish must have a dark sign to overcome that barrier - what happens when he goes down ? Oh , the Death Eater released a curse that halved the ceiling , and thus broke the spell that blocked the stairs . Lupine replied , " Everyone runs up - All the people still standing - and then Snape and the boy appeared behind the dust - so , none of us attacked them . - We let them go through Tonks , whispered everyone . They thought they were chasing Death Eaters - and then the other Death Eaters and Greyback came back and we had to keep on hitting - I thought I heard Snape yell at something , but I do not know what that is - He shouted Done ! Harry did what he wanted to do . Everyone was silent . 
Fawkes ' friends still rang through the night on the school grounds . 
As the music reverberated everywhere , thoughts all over Harry unconsciously .... 
Did they put Dumbledore's body out of the tower ? 
What will happen next ? 
Where will you rest ? 
He clutched his hand in his pocket . 
He could feel the chill of the Horcrux faking his right wrist . 
The door to the hospital again opened again , causing everyone to startle . 
Mrs Weasley ran into the ward , Fleur followed them , her beautiful face frightened . Molly - Arthur - Professor McGonagall speaks , rush to greet them I'm really sorry .. Bill Weasley whispered , over to Professor McGonagall to see the broken face of Bill Oh , Bill ! Lupine and Tonks got up quickly and made room for Mrs. Weasley to get closer to the bed . 
Mrs. Weasley hugged her son and placed her lips on his bloody forehead . She said Greyback had attacked it ? Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall . But he has not changed yet ? 
What does that mean ? 
What will happen to Bill ? We do not know yet , Professor McGonagall answered , looking helplessly at Lupine . Maybe there will be some changes , Arthur Lupine said this is a rare case , perhaps the only one ... 
We still do not know what Bill's attitude would be like when it came to wake up ... Mrs. Weasley took the light blue ointment from Mrs. Promfrey and started pinning Bill's wounds . And Dumbledore .... Mrs. Weasley went on to Minerva , was not she ? Actually it was .... To As Professor McGonagall nodded , Harry felt Ginny walk towards her and look at her . Her narrow eyes fixed on Fleur , who was looking down at Bill with a cold face . Dumbledore was gone , Mr. Weasley whispered , but Mrs. Weasley just looked at her eldest son , and she began to sob , the tears of Bill's face differently . Of course , no matter what it looks like ... 
Really not important ... 
But it was a very handsome boy .... 
always very handsome .... 
And it was getting married .... What do you say ? Fleur suddenly said that he was preparing to marry ? Mrs. Weasley turned her watery eyes , surprised - just - you Bill would not want to marry me ? Fleur asked him , because of the bite that Bill would not love him anymore ? No , that's not .. Because we're going to get married ! Fleur said , straightening up and throwing his long platinum hair back . Will need more than a werewolf to make Bill not love me anymore ! Well , that's probably what Mrs. Weasley said . But I think maybe - let's say - it's going to be ... Uncle thinks I'm not going to marry him ? Or maybe you're hoping ? Fleur continued , his nostrils were all he needed to care about what he would look like . 
You are beautiful enough for both of you , I am so ! 
All these scars will show everyone that your husband is a brave man ! 
And I will do it ! She added in a fierce manner , pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching a bottle of ointment in her hand . 
Mrs. Weasley turned to her husband and watched Fleur wipe the wounds of Bill with an utterly curious look . 
No one said anything , Harry did not even dare to move . 
Like everyone else , it waits for a rage to erupt . Mrs. Weasley's mother's aunt Muriel spoke after a long , beautiful crescent crown - made by a goblin - and she was sure she would convince her aunt to borrow on the wedding day . 
She likes Bill very well , you know , and it will fit your hair . Thank you , Fleur said stiffly . I'm sure it will be beautiful . And then , Harry did not know how to do so , both women crying and hugging each other . 
Confused , and as if the world had gone mad , he turned back : Ron looked just as shocked as he and Ginny and Hermione exchanged astonishment . You see ! A weak voice . 
Tonks looking at Lupine . She still wants to marry him , even though he's been bitten ! 
She does not care ! But that was different , Lupine said without seeming to smirk , and suddenly looked very tense Bill would not really be a werewolf . 
This is the case . But I do not care , I do not care ! Said Tonks , gripping the front of Lupine's shirt . I told you a thousand times .... And the meaning of the Tonks ' guardian spirit , as well as the gray hair of her rat hair , and the reason she had run to find Dumbledore right after hearing that someone had been attacked by Greyback , all suddenly became clear . With Harry , Sirius is not the person Tonks loves . And you have told me a thousand times , Lupine continued , avoiding looking in her eyes and looking at the floor that he was too old for me , too poor .... 
Too dangerous ... ... I said you have set yourself a strange limit in this , then Remus Mrs. Weasley said over Fleur while patting her shoulder . I do not bother , Lupine said firmly . Tonks deserves a young and perfect person But she wants him , Mr. Weasley replies , with a slight smile . And after all , Remus , young men and integrity are not forever . He looked sadly at his son , lying among them . Now ... it's not the time to talk about this , Lupine said , avoiding all eyes of people when he looked around indifferently . Dumbledore lost .... Dumbledore would be more than happy to think that there is a little love in the world . Professor McGonagall said shortly , as the door to the sickness opened again and Hargid came in . 
A small part of it was not covered by hair or beard on his face soaked and swollen ; he was trembling with tears , in his hand was a large handkerchief , patchy . I did ... . was done , Professor Lean hiccup . 
I have already moved . 
Professor Sprout took the children to bed . 
Professor Flitwick was lying down , and he said he would be fine in a little while , and Professor Slughorn said that the Ministry had been informed . Thank you , Hagrid , Professor McGonagall said , get up immediately and look back at the people around Bill's bed . I will have to see the Ministry when they come here . 
Hagrid , tell the house masters - Slughorn can represent the Slytherins - that I would like to meet them in my office . 
And I also want you to go with them . When Hagrid nodded , turned away and left the room , she looked down at Harry . Before meeting them , she wanted a word with Harry . 
If you go with her .... Harry got up , talked to everyone else with Ron , Hermione and Ginny , and followed Professor McGonagall across the room . 
The outer corridor is completely deserted and the only sound is the phoenix song resounding far away . 
A few minutes ago Harry realized that they were not going to Professor McGonagall's office , but toward Dumbledore's office , and a few seconds later he realized that , of course , she was an assistant principal . . 
Maybe now she has become the headmaster ... so is the room behind the stone statue now . 
They silently walked up the spiral staircase and entered the circular room . 
He did not know what it was waiting for , that the room would be covered in black , perhaps , or even that Dumbledore's body was lying there . 
Actually , it looks almost 
It was just like it and Dumbledore had left a few hours ago , silver tools still hissing and shaking gently on their table , the Gryffindor sword still in the glass , glittering under the light . moon , hat on the shelf under the table , Fawkes tree sticks stand still , the phoenix continues to keep his pupil on the school grounds ... 
And a new portrait joined the ranks of the deceased Hogwarts principals : Dumbledore was sleeping in the middle of a hanging frame on his desk , his half - moon glasses resting on his crutched nose , looking peaceful . and serene . 
After glancing at the portrait , Professor McGonagall made a quirky act as though he were taking the spirits , and she rounded the table to look at Harry , his tense face . Harry , she says she wants to know what she and Dumbledore did tonight , when she and her son left school . I can not tell you , Professor Harry said . 
It was waiting for this question and prepared the answer . 
It is here , in this room , that Dumbledore told him not to tell anyone about the contents of their lessons , except for Ron and Hermione . 
Harry , this is important , said Harry , very important , but he did not want me to tell anyone that Professor McGonagall glanced at Potter - Harry realized he was being called by them - In the light of Dumbledore's departure , she thought she had definitely realized how the situation had changed - I do not think so , said Harry , shrugging . Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop doing what he told me after he lost . But - There is one thing you need to know before the magic set . 
Mrs. Rosmerta was struck by an authoritative curse ; she helped Malfoy and the Death Eaters , which is why the necklace and the poison cup - Rosmerta ? Professor McGonagall reiterated , skeptical , but before she could speak again , there was a knock on the door behind them , and Professor Sprout , Flitwick and Slughorn came into the room , followed by Hagrid , still crying nonstop , his ribs trembled in sobs . Snape ! Slughorn uttered , looks the most shocking , pale and sweating the most . Snape ! 
I taught him ! 
I thought I knew him ! But before anyone could respond , a very distinctive voice rang out from Minerva's feet . The Minister would come in seconds , he had just landed from the set . Thanks , Everard Professor McGonagall . said , and she turned quickly to the teachers . I want to talk about what happened at Hogwarts before he came here , she said quickly . Personally , I think the school will reopen next year . 
The death of the principal in the hands of one of our colleagues is a stigma in Hogwarts history . 
It's horrible I'm sure Dumbledore will want the school to continue . Professor Sprout says , " If only one student wanted to go to school , the school would be open to that student . a student after this ? Slughorn said , wiping his sweaty eyebrows with a silk handkerchief . Parents will want to keep their children home and I can not blame them . 
In my opinion , I think we are not safe at Hogwarts , but we can not expect mothers to think the same way . 
They will want the whole family together , of course . 
I agree , Professor McGonagall goes on . And in any case , it's not entirely right to say that Dumbledore has never confronted school closures - and I must say Dumbledore's murder . Much more worrisome than a Slytherin monster living in the castle ... We have to consult the government . Professor Flitwick said in a mice voice , he had a big bruise on his forehead . , but does not seem to have been injured by the frost in Snape's office . We have to follow the prescribed procedures . 
Can not make a decision in a hurry . Hagrid , you have not said anything yet . Professor McGonagall says how he is , should Hogwarts continue to open the door ? Hagrid , who was crying quietly at his old handkerchief during the conversation , raised his red eyes and said , " I do not know , Professor ... that's the decision of the Chair . the houses and the principal ... Professor Dumbledore always appreciates Professor McGonagall's comments , and I too , I will stay , Hagrid said , tears still flowing out of the corner of his eye . old and fallen bearded here is my home , this is my home since I was 13 years old . 
And if the kids want me to teach them , I ' ll teach them . 
But ... I do not know ... 
Hogwarts without Dumbledore .... He woke up and disappeared from his handkerchief , and the silence was over . Very well , Professor McGonagall said , glancing out the window to the yard to check if the Minister has arrived , and I have to agree with Filius that the thing to do is consult the government , who will make the decision . final . Now , be prepared to take all the students home ... have ideas that should do it soon . 
We can arrange the Hogwarts to tomorrow if needed ... What about Dumbledore's funeral ? Harry finally spoke . 
Professor McGonagall said , losing a little bit of agility as her voice shuddered . I - I know Dumbledore wants to be here , at Hogwarts ... And that will be done , right ? Harry says fierce If the witch thinks it is appropriate Prof . McGonagall replies No other principal has ever ... No principals ever contributed to this school ! Growled Hagrid . Hogwarts should be where Dumbledore is forever resting , says Professor Flitwick . That's right , Professor Sprout said . And in that case , Harry said , teachers should not send students home until the funeral ends . 
They will want to say - The last choke in his throat , but Professor Sprout said it was a good farewell , Professor Flitwick uttered . 
Our students should be grateful , so be it . 
We can step back and leave . Then Professor Sprout cut off , I think ... 
yeah ... Slughorn said in a rather agitated voice , while Hagrid uttered a sob . He arrived , Professor McGonagall suddenly said , looking down the court Mr. Minister .... 
And as far as I see , he brought with him a delegation .... Can you go , professor ? Harry said at once It was totally undesirable to meet , or questioned by Rufus Scrimgeour tonight . Okay , Professor McGonagall answered . Hurry up and go to the door and open it . 
He hurried toward the staircase and through the empty corridor , it had left the stealth cloak at the top of the astronomical pyramid , but nothing happened , no one in the corridor to see it through , even Even Filch , Mrs. Norris , or Peeves are not . 
She did not see anyone until she reached the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower . Really ? Mrs. Beo whispered when he met her . Is that really true ? Dumbledore - dead ? Yes , Harry answered . 
She uttered a moan and , without waiting for the password , moved forward for it . 
As Harry thought , the living room was crowded . 
The room sank into silence as it entered through the portrait hole . 
He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in the middle of a nearby group : so that means the bedroom would be empty , or almost the same . 
Without saying a word , without looking at anyone , Harry went straight through the room and into the boys ' bedroom . 
As he hoped , Ron was waiting for him , still wearing his clothes , sitting on his bed . 
Harry sat down and for a moment , the two of them simply looked at each other . They talked about closing Harry's school to Lupine saying they would do it , Ron replied . 
Silent . So ? Ron said in a very small voice , as if he was scared of the stuff that was eavesdropping . Did you find out ? 
Can you get it ? 
One - a Horcrux ? Harry shook his head . 
Everything that happens around that dark lake now seems like an old nightmare , is that really happening , just hours ago ? Can not you get it ? Said Ron , disappointed It was not there ? No Harry replied . Someone took it first and left a fake in that place and got it - ? Without saying anything , Harry took the bag from his heart pocket and opened it and handed it to Ron . 
The whole story can be left behind .... 
That did not happen tonight . . 
Nothing happens except the ending , the end of that meaningless trip , the end of Dumbledore's life .... 
R . A . B Ron whispered but who was it ? Not knowing anymore Harry said , put his back on the bed and still leave the clothes and look lifeless in front . 
It's not curious about R . A . B : It's doubtful whether it will ever be curious again . 
While lying there , it suddenly found that the school grounds had become quiet . 
Fawkes stopped singing . 
And he knew , not knowing that he knew , that the phoenix had left Hogwarts forever , just as Dumbledore had left school , leaving the world ... leaving Harry 
Chapter 30 White Tomb 
All lessons are postponed , and all competitions are suspended . 
Then a few days later some of the students rushed away from Hogwarts with their parents - Patil's twins had gone before breakfast the day after Dumbledore and Zacharias Smith's death escorted out of the castle by the real father . his arrogance . 
On the other hand , Seamus Finnigan refused to go straight to his mother ; They had a quarrel in the entrance to the hall that was only resolved when she accepted that it could stay for the funeral . 
Seamus had told Harry and Ron that she had trouble finding a place to stay in Hogsmeade Village , because the witches and wizards flocked to the village , prepared to pay their last tribute to their respect . Dumbledore . 
Some excitement has occurred among young students , who have never seen such a thing before , when a blue - haired horse carriage was about the size of a house , pulled by twelve giant wings of gold , soaring through the sky at sunset before the funeral and landing on the edge of the restricted forest . 
Harry looked from a window as a gorgeous and beautiful woman with olive skin , black hair came down from the wagon and plunged into Hagrid's waiting arms . 
Meanwhile a delegation of ministry officials , including the Minister of Magic , was in the castle . 
Harry decided to avoid contact with any of them ; It is certain that , sooner or later , he will be asked about what happened to Dumbledore's last trip out of Hogwarts . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny spent all their time together . 
The weather is as ridiculous as them ; Harry could imagine how Dumbledore would die , and they could have been together for the rest of the school year , Ginny's exams were over , the burden of homework was removed . And every now and then , it talks about what it knows it must say , doing what it knows is right , because it's so hard to give up the best source of comfort it has . 
They visited the hospital twice a day : Neville was discharged , but Bill was still under the care of Mrs. Pomfrey . 
His scars are so terrible ; Actually , now he's Moody crazy , obviously with good luck with his eyes and legs , but personally he seems to be the same . 
All the changes are that now he has a strong appetite for delicious beef . 
So fortunately he would marry me , Fleur said happily , fixing Bill's pillow , because the Brit was cooking too much meat , I always said this . I suppose you ' ll have to admit that he's going to marry her , then Ginny sighs in the dark , when Harry , Ron , and Hermione sit by the open window of the Gryffindor living room , looking out . The dark areas are dim . She was not that bad , Harry said . Although , silly , it hastily added , as Ginny raised her eyebrows and she revealed a reluctant laugh . Well , I think if you can bear it , you can bear it . Is there anyone else that we know die ? Ron asked Hermione , studying the ' evening prophet ' . 
Hermione frowned at the persistent compulsion in her voice . No , she rebuked , folded the newspaper . They're still looking for Snape , but there's no trace of course . No , of course , Harry said , he became angry every time the subject was pulled out . 
They will not find Snape until they find Voldemort , and find that they will never do it this time . I go to sleep , Ginny yawns . I have not been able to sleep since I was able to sleep . The girl kisses Harry ( Ron looks away sarcastically ) , waving to the other two and into the student dorm . 
When the door behind the girl was closed , Hermione leaned toward Harry with a look - like - Hermione - on her face . Harry , this morning I found one , in the library , About R . A . B . Harry asked , sitting up straight . 
It does not feel like it was before , stimulating , curious , anxious to find out to the end of a secret ; It simply knows that the task of discovering the truth about the True Spirit must be fulfilled before it can advance a little along the dark and winding path that stretches before it , the way it and Dumledore had started the journey together , and was the way he now knew he would have to go alone . 
There may be four Pieces of Soul 
Somewhere out there and must be found and removed even before the possibility of Voldemort being destroyed . 
They recite their names , as if by listing them , they can carry them with a touch of the hand : the locket , the snake trophy something belongs to Gryffindor or Ravenclaw locket , Snake Cup Something belongs to Gryffindor or Ravenclaw . This muttering seems to have passed through Harry's mind as it sank into sleep at night , and his dreams were filled with trophies , laces and objects . Dumbledore was kind enough to give it a rope ladder that immediately turned into snakes as it began to climb . It showed Hermione the note inside the locket . The morning after Dumbledore's preparation , and although she did not immediately recognize the first words belonged to an unknown witch She had read that , since her library more often essential both for people without homework . No , she's sad , I tried hard , Harry , but I did not find a few famous witches with these initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... 
Rupert " Axebanger " Brookstanton ... but no one seems to match . 
According to this inscription , the person who had stolen that Death Piece knew Voldemort , and I could not find a piece of evidence of what Bungs or Axebanger had ever had with him , actually , that was about . Well , Snape . She looked upset when she said the name again . What about him ? Harry asked heavily , dropping his armchair . 
Well , that's just the part I'm about right now about the Prince , she said hesitantly . Are you forced to do that ? Do you know how I feel about that now ? No - no - Harry , I did not mean it ! she said hastily , looking around to make sure they were not eavesdropping . I'm referring to Eileen Prince once owned the book . 
You see she's Snape's mother ! I think she must have been not that easy , Ron said . 
Hermione ignored it . I'm reading the rest of the Old Prophet and there is a small note about Eileen Prince marrying a man named Tobias Snape , and then there is a message saying she was born a murderer , Harry Spit out , Hermione said . So I was somewhat right . 
Snape must have been proud to be Prince , you see ? 
Tobias Snape is a Muggie according to what was said in The Prophet . Yeah , that's it , Harry said . He goes to the purebred because he can integrate with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them like Voldemort . 
A pure mother , a shameless Muggie father , tries to scare himself by using Dark Arts , giving himself an impressive new name . - Lord Voldemort - Prince of Hybrids - How could Dumbledore be wrong ? 
She dumped the object , looking out the window . 
It could not stop Dumbledore's inexcusable belief in Snape , but when Hermione had accidentally reminded him of it , it was Harry , who himself had feigned that despite the increasing disgust scribbled screams , it refused to believe in the evil side of the boy was very clever , has helped it a lot Help it is a thought almost unbearable , now I I do not understand why he did not make you stop using that book , Ron said . He must know that you have all of these things from here . ' I still do not get why he did not turn you in for that book , ' said Ron . ' He was known where you were getting it from . ' 
He knew , Harry said bitterly . He knew when I used the curse Secfumsempra . 
He really did not need to read his mind even before , thanks to Slughorn talking about how he excelled in the poison he'd put his old book in the bottom of that cupboard , right To But why did not he ? I did not think he wanted to have any relationship with the book , Hermione said . I do not think Dumbledore liked it if he knew it . 
And even if Snape pretends it's not his , then Slughorn will pick up his streak . 
Nevertheless , the book was left in Snape's old classroom , and I bet Dumbledore knew that his mother had them as ' Prince ' . I should not have given Dumbledore a look at the book , Harry said . All of those times , I showed how badly Voldemort was when he was at school , and I proved that Snape was the same - ' Bad ' was the wrong word , Hermione said calmly . You're the one who kept telling me that the book was dangerous ! I'm trying to say , Harry , that you're condemning yourself too well . 
I think the Prince seems to have a dirty sense of humor , but I could not guess he was a potential killer . Neither of us could have guessed that Snape would know you , Ron said . . 
They covered each other , but Harry was sure that they , like him , were thinking of the next morning when Dumbledore's body would be laid to rest . 
Harry never attended a funeral before ; There is no body to bury when Sirius dies . 
It does not know what to expect and is a little worried about what it will have to look at , what it will feel . 
He wondered if Dumbledore's death had become more real to him at the end of the funeral . 
Although it has moments when the terrible truth threatens to bury it , there are long empty places of frostbite somewhere , despite the fact that nobody in the castle has spoken about anything else , It was still hard to believe that Dumbledore had actually left . 
Admittedly , it was not , as Sirius , desperately looking for a somber hole , somehow , that Dumbledore would return to it , feeling in his pockets the cold chain of the Piece . The fake soul that carries it all over , not as a charm , but to remind it of what it costs and what still has to be done . 
The next day Harry got up early to arrange ; The Hogwarts will be delivered one hour after the funeral . 
When he went downstairs , he saw a relief in the Great Hall . 
Everyone was dressed in robes and no one seemed hungry . 
Professor McGonagall had left the high chair between the empty teacher's desk . 
Hagrid's chair was empty too : Harry thought he might not be able to face breakfast ; But Snape's place was taken by Rufus Scrimgeour . 
Harry avoided his yellow eyes as they swept through the Hall ; Harry has an uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour is looking for it . 
In Scrimgeour's entourage , Harry saw redheads and horns of Percy Weasley . 
Ron does not seem to have noticed that Percy , except for stabbing a smoked salted herring with a rare hatred . 
At the table Slytherin Crabbe and Goyle were whispering to each other . 
Though they are big awkward , they look lonely without Malfoy's high - pitched look in the middle , leading them . 
Harry did not spend much thought on Malfoy . 
Its hatred for Snape , but it did not forget the fear in Malfoy's voice at the top of the tower , nor did it forget the fact that it had sacked the wand before the Death Eaters arrived . 
Harry did not believe that Malfoy would kill Dumbledore . 
He still despised Malfoy for his wild devotion to Dark Arts , but now even the smallest regret is mixed with hatred . 
Harry wondered , where was Malfoy now , and what did Voldemort do for him when threatening to kill him and his parents ? 
Harry's thoughts are interrupted by Ginny's impulses to his side . 
Professor McGonagall stood up and the murmuring murmur in the hall immediately disappeared . It's about time , she said . 
Follow the masters of the game . 
Gryffindors house , follow her . They lined up behind the benches in silence . 
Harry glanced at Slughorn , who was at the head of the Slytherin Row , wearing a splendid silver garment . 
He had never seen Professor Sprout , the President of the Hufflepuffs , look so clean ; There was not a piece of ice on her cap , and as they reached the entrance to the hall , they saw Mrs. Pince , in a thick black net covering her knees , standing next to Mr. Filch in a black tuxedo . Old and dirty black tie smells mingled . 
They were leading , as Harry realized as he walked up the stone stairs in front of the castle to get out , toward the lake . 
The warm sun scorched his face as they followed silently behind Professor McGonagall to place the hundred seats in the line . 
A long walkway in the middle : a marble table in front , and all the chairs face it . It is the most beautiful summer day . 
An unusual classification among those who sit on half the seats : dull and drab , old and young . 
Harry did not notice all the monks , but there were some things he noticed , including the members of the Order of the Phoenix : Kingsley Shacklebolt , Mr. Moody's eyes - crazy , Miss Tonks , her hair color turned radiant pink Remus Lupine , they seem to be holding hands , Mr. and Mrs. Weasley , Bill is Fleur and behind is Fred and Georgh , wearing a black leather dragon skirt . 
Then there was Mrs. Maxime , who occupied more than two chairs , Tom , the owner of the cauldron , the witch Arabella Figg , the neighbor of Harry , the bass player of the band Monroe , Irnie Frang , Mrs Malkin , who owns a T - shirt in Algonquin , and some of the others Harry barely knew , as the bartender at the pig's head and the witch still pushing the cart on Hogwarts . 
The ghosts in the castle are also there , hard to see in the bright sun , only visible when they move , dim in the air . 
Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny sat down on the stools near the lake . 
People whispered to each other , like the flies on , but the birds singing is still here . the crowd continues to crowd ; Without any effect , Harry sees Neville being assisted by Luna in a chair . 
Only those two responded to Hermione's nickname the night Dumbledore died , and Harry knew why : Only the two of them remembered the DA , who checked their pennies in hopes of winning . that there would be another meeting . Cornelius Fudge walked past them toward the front row , without showing any emotion , turning his berries as usual ; Then Harry noticed Rita Skeeter , who made her go mad when she saw it , clutching a notebook in the hand of an autopilot ; And then , with the greatest anger , Dolores Umbridge , an uncharacteristically sullen look on her toad - like face , a velvet ribbon lurking on top of curly hair . 
When he saw the centaur Firenze standing as a guard by the lake , she immediately rushed to the farthest chair . 
The officials sat down in the end . 
Harry could see Scrimgeour looking brave and respectful in the upstairs room with Professor McGonagall . 
He wondered whether this Scrimgeour was as good as any of this important people 
Grieve for Dumbledore and forget his hatred for the Ministry when looking around for that . 
Not only myself : a lot of heads are turning around , looking for a small signal . There , Ginny whispered into Harry's ear . 
And he saw them in the water clean and sunny , under the surface of the tenth , reminding him of the horrors of the living Flesh ; a mermaid's song in a strange language that he does not understand , their pale faces rippling , the red hair of the mermaid swirling around them . 
That music made Harry's hair bulge up and it felt uncomfortable . 
The song is about loss and despair . 
As he looked down at the wild faces of the fishermen , he felt that they , at least , were grieving for Dumbledore's departure . 
Then Ginny pushed it again and looked around . 
Hagrid was walking slowly down the aisle . 
He was crying silently , his face tingling , and his arms were wrapped in purple velvet with gold stars , something Harry knew was the body of Dumbledore . 
A sore throat in Harry's throat when he saw this : for a moment , the strange music and the realization that the dumbledore body was so close seemed to take away all the warmth of the day . 
Ron looked pale and shocked . 
Tears fell on the gown of Ginny and Hermione . 
They can not see clearly what is going on . 
Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully on the table . 
Now he backed off the aisle , blowing his nose like a trumpet , causing a look of resentment from some , like Harry saw , including Dolores Umbridge but Harry knew Dumbledore was not interested . 
He tried to make a friendly gesture as Hagrid passed by , but Hagrid's eyes were puffy so he wondered if he saw the road . 
Harry glanced back to the back seat to see where Hagrid was aiming and realized , in his suit and trousers , the size of the cafeteria was giant Grawp with a round , rocky , stupid , easy - going head . Makes , looks almost like a human . 
Hagrid sat down next to his half - sister and Grawp slammed Hagrid's head into the ground . 
Harry had a moment to laugh . 
But then the song stopped and it turned upside down . 
A small man with a thick beard in his large black robes stood up and was now standing in front of Dumbledore's body . 
Harry could not hear him . 
The words pounding towards them through hundreds of noble souls contribute to their great intellectual heart which does not mean much . 
It did not make sense to Dumbledore that Harry knew . 
It suddenly recalled Dumbledore's ideas in a few words : ' stupid ' , ' scarlet head ' , ' blush ' and ' pinch ' , and again , it had to stop a grin . Have not you been wrong ? 
There was a tap on the left side of it , and he saw that the fishermen had also come up out of the water to hear . 
He still remembered Dumbledore kneeling on the water two years ago , very close to where Harry was sitting , and talking in Human language with the Captain of the Mermaid . 
Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned the Human language . 
There are so many things she has never asked , so many things she should tell her . And then , without warning , sweep through it , that terrible , complete and undeniable truth like never before . 
Dumbledore was already dead , he was far away , and he gripped the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt , but it could not stop the hot tears from his eyes : it turned away . Ginny and the others and looking out into the lake , the Forbidden Forest , when the little man still said there was a movement between the trees . 
The Centaurs also came and paid homage . 
They did not come out of the forest but Harry did 
Seeing them standing silent , hiding half in the dark , watching the witches , the bow hanging from his side . 
And Harry remembered his first nightmare trip into the Forbidden Forest , first encountering what was then Voldemort , and how it had faced him , and he and Dumbledore had spoken . Why did not the fight last ? This is very important , Dumbledore said , fighting , and fighting back , and continuing to fight , only when the cruelty was cornered , never completely destroyed . Under the sun , those who took care of it were standing by it one by one , his mother , his father , his godfather , and finally Dumbledore , who firmly defended it ; But now it's over . 
She can not let anyone stand between her and Voldemort ; It must forever shed the illusion that it seemed to have died at the age of one : the arms of her parents meant that nothing could hurt her . 
Never once did it awaken in the nightmare without the unpleasant whispers in the dark that it was really safe , it was only in its imagination ; The last and greatest protector died and it was much loner than before . 
The little man in his black robes stopped speaking and finally returned to his place . 
Harry waits for someone to stand up ; He expected the eulogy , perhaps from the Minister , but no one moved . 
Then there were many screaming . 
The bright , white flames flickered around Dumbledore's body and the table beneath them : they kept rising , rising forever , obscuring their bodies . 
White smoke pulses into the air and creates freakish shapes : Harry thought , for a brief while his heart stopped , that he saw a phoenix happily flying into the sky , but only a second behind . fire has disappeared . 
Instead , it was a white marble table , Dumbledore's shroud and the table on which it was placed . 
There were a few screams of horror when a rain of arrows torn , but they fell far away from the crowd . that is , Harry knew , the grapevine's words : he saw them turn and disappear into the shady trees . 
Likewise fishermen slowly dive into the deep blue waters and lose sight of them . 
Harry looked at Ginny , Ron and Hermione : Ron's face was narrowed down by the sun . 
Hermion's tearful face was filled with tears , but Ginny did not cry anymore . 
She caught her gaze with a fierce glare that she had never seen since she had embraced it after winning the Quidditch trophy without it , and in that moment it knew . They understand each other well , and when she is about to tell her what she will do , she will not say ' be careful ' or ' do not do it ' , but will accept her decision , because she Will not expect anything lower than that in it . 
And so it made itself hard to say what it knew it had to say since Dumbledore had died . Ginny , he heard this quietly , as the noise of the conversation grew louder around them and people began to walk . I can not be with you anymore . 
We must stop seeing each other . 
We can not be together . She said , with a stupid laugh , for some noble reason , silly ? It's like there's something more than life , the last few weeks with you , Harry said . But you can not we can not now you have things to do alone . She did not cry , she only looked at him , Voldemort used those close to his enemy . 
He also used me as bait once , and only because he was the sister of his best friend . 
Think about how dangerous you will be if we still maintain this relationship . 
He will know , he will find out . 
He will try to catch you through me . What if I do not care ? Asked Ginny fiercely . He cared , Harry said . Do you know what I'm going to see if this is my funeral and for your sake ? He turned away , looking over the lake . I never really stopped loving you , she said . 
really not . 
I have always hoped for Hermione to say that I have to try my best in life , to be able to date someone else , to relax a bit with him , because I have never been used to talking when he was in the room , he Remember ? 
And she thinks that you will pay more attention if you do more . An intelligent girl , Hermione , said Harry , laughing . I just wish you had spoken to me earlier . 
We were able to make the months possible . But he was too busy to save the wizarding world , Ginny said , smiling slightly . Well I can not say I was surprised . You already know that this will eventually happen . 
I know you will not be happy until you hunt for Voldemort . 
Maybe that's why I like him so much . Harry could not bear to hear these words , just as he did not think he was determined to remain with her . 
Ron , as he saw it , was hugging Hermione now and stroking her hair as she sobbed over her shoulder , tears dripping down her long nose . 
With a pained expression , Harry stands up , turns his back on Ginny and Dumbledore's grave and walks around the lake . Traveling makes it a lot easier to sit back : as well as starting the traces of the Soul Piece as soon as possible and destroying Voldemort will be more pleasant than waiting to do it . She turned around . 
Rufus Scrimgeour was limping so fast toward him by the lake , leaning against his cane . 
I was hoping some words would you mind if I went for a walk with you ? No , Harry said innocently , and again Harry , this is a terrible tragedy , Scrimgeour said quietly , I can not tell you how scared I was when I heard that . 
Dumbledore was a great witch . 
We have points of disagreement , you know , but no one knows as well - What do you want ? Harry asked frankly Scrimgeour looked annoyed but , as before , he hastily adjusted his gaze to a sullen look . I was , of course , destroyed , he said . 
I know you are very close to Dumbledore . 
I think she may be the best student of her . 
The bond between him and the instrument . What do you want ? Harry repeated , stopping . 
Scrimgeour also stood , leaning on the cane and staring at Harry , whose expression was irritating . The words that I was with him the night he left school and because it was dead . Whose words ? Someone has struck a Death Eater on the top of the tower after Dumbledore's invention . 
There are also two broomsticks . 
You know , Harry . It was nice to hear that , Harry said . Yes , where I went with Dumbledore and what we did was my job . 
You do not want anyone to know . It was a great honor , of course , Scrimgeour said , it was hard 
Dumbledore was gone , Harry . 
You have gone far . He pointed out that there was no one here who was loyal to him , Hary said , smiling despite himself . 
My dear son even Dumbledore can not return from - I do not say he can . 
You do not understand . 
But I have nothing to say to you . Scrimgeour hesitated , then spoke in a tone that was considered elegant , that the Department could give him any protection , you know , Harry . 
I would be very happy to set some gods to protect you - Harry laughed . Voldemort wanted to kill me myself and the gods would not stop him . 
So thanks for the offer . 
But no thanks . Then , Scrimgeour said , in a cold voice , the request I made to you at Christmas - What petition ? Oh yes where I told people about the work you are doing great new way to exchange for - - the elevation of the spirit of everyone ! Scrimgeour said suddenly . 
Harry assessed him for a moment . 
Stan Shunpike has been released yet ? Scrimgeour's face turned into an angry purple that reminded him of Uncle Vernon . I see that you are - Dumbledore's man forever , Harry said . that's right Scrimgeour stared at it for a moment , then turned away and limped off without saying a word . 
Harry could see Percy and the rest of the delegation waiting for him , glaring uncomfortably at Hagrid , and Grawp was sitting in his chair . 
Ron and Hermione hurried toward Harry , past Scrimgeour , who was walking in the opposite direction ; Harry turned and walked slowly , catching up with them , and they caught up to the shade of the oak tree , which at their base had been sitting together in happier times . 
What does Scrimgeour want ? Asked Hermione . As he wanted at Christmas , Harry shrugged . Want to give confidential information about Dumbledore and want to become a puppet of the Ministry . Ron seems to struggle with himself for a moment , and then he speaks loudly to Hermione , See this , let me go back and give Percy a fight ! No , she said firmly , grabbing his arm . That will make me feel better ! Harry laughed . 
Even Hermione smiled a little , though her smile was pale and she looked up at the castle . I can not stand the thought that we will never come back . She said softly . How could Hogwarts shut the door ? Maybe not , Ron said . We are safer here than at home , right ? 
Nowhere is that possible . 
Even though I can say Hogwarts is safer , there are more witches in here to protect this place . 
What are you doing , Harry ? I will not go back even though the school opened the door , Harry said . 
Ron gasped at it , but Hermione just said sadly , I know he would say so . 
But what will you do ? I will return to the Dursleys again , because Dumbledore wanted me to do so , Harry said . But just for a short trip , and then I will go always . But where would you go if you did not go to school ? I thought I would return to Godric's Valley , Harry whispered . 
It had this idea in mind since the night Dumbledore had died . For me , everything has 
Starting from there , all things . 
I have a feeling that I have to come . 
And I can go to visit his father's cheeks , I want to do that . So then ? Asked Ron . Then I will have to look for the remaining Souls , right ? Harry said , his gaze resting on Dumbledore's white tomb , reflecting on the water at the other side of the lake . That's what you want to do , that's why you talk to me about it . 
If Dumbledore was right - and I'm sure this - there are still four out there . 
I have to go find and destroy them and trace the seventh soul of Voldemort , it is still in his body , and I will destroy him . 
And if I meet Severus Snape on the way , he adds , the more I try , the worse he will be . Silent for a long moment . The crowd was almost dispersed , the people who had lagged behind Grawp as he cuddled old Hagrid , sucking in dreadful mournful echoes across the water . 
We will also be there , Harry , Ron said . What ? to your aunt , Ron said . And then we ' ll go with you , to wherever you are going . No - Harry said quickly , it did not take into account this , it was only intended to let them know that he was taking this dangerous journey alone . 
Once upon a time he told us , Hermione said quietly , that there is still time to go back if we want . 
We have time , right ? We were with you no matter what , Ron said . But , this friend , you will have to go through your parents before we even charge , including the valley of Godric . Why ? Bill's and Fleur's wedding , remember ? Harry looked at him , startled ; The idea that there is something normal like a wedding can still happen seems unbelievable and really great . Oh , we should not miss that occasion , in the end say . 
His hand automatically grips the fake Horcrux , but despite everything , despite the dark and winding path it sees stretched out in front of him , no matter what the final confrontation with Voldemort speaks for sure . will come , whether in a month , a year or ten years , he sees his heart fly in the thought that there is always a last peace day of peace he enjoys with Ron and Hermione .
