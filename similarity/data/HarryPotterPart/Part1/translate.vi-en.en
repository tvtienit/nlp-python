Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone 
CHAPTER ONE : THE BOY WHO LIVED 
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley , Privet Drive Privet Drive No . 4 , is proud to say that they are completely normal , thank you for your concern . 
Do not expect them to believe in bizarre or mysterious things , simply because they do not seem to care about those silly things . 
Mr. Dursley is the director of a company called Grunnings , which specializes in drilling . 
He was a tall , athletic , almost neckless man , but with a great mustache . 
Mrs Dursley was thin , blond , with a long double normal neck , which was good for her to cross the fence to look at her neighbor . 
The Dursleys have a baby boy named Dudley who , in their opinion , can not have a better baby in the world . 
The Dursleys had everything they wanted , but they also had a secret , and their biggest fear was that the secret was revealed to someone . 
They are afraid that it will be difficult to bear if the story of the Potter family is discovered . 
Mrs. Potter is Mrs. Dursley's sister , but for years they have never met . 
Mrs. Dursley pretended she did not have any sisters , because her cousin and her inexperienced husband could not have had the style of the Dursleys . 
Mrs Dursley shivered at the thought of what the neighbors would say if the Potter family appeared at her door . 
They know the Potter family has a little boy , but they have not seen it yet . That child was one reason they were away from the Potter family : They did not want Dudley's son to betray Potter . 
On a drab , murky Tuesday morning , the Dursleys woke up , not feeling at all , that the sky was clouded by mysterious strangest things going on in England . 
Mr. Dursley gulped down at the world's most worn tie to wear his neck . 
Mrs. Dursley clapped her hands while struggling with Dudley's screaming mother , who refused to sit down for good . 
No one noticed a large and black owl flying through the window . 
At eight o ' clock , Mr. Dursley books a couple , sneaks Mrs. Dursley one by one and tries to kiss his son before going to work . 
But Dudley was playing trumpet drumming , puffing food and pounding everything , including his father's kiss . 
Mr. Dursley laughed : The puppy , just out of the house . 
He got in his car , drove out of his 4 th house . 
It was at the corner of the road that he noticed the first sign of a strange thing : A cat saw the map . 
At first , Mr. Dursley did not realize that was bizarre . 
Then he jerked back to look again . 
There was a wildcat standing at the corner of Privet Drive , but now there is no map ! 
Was it imagined by you ? 
Or did the light dazzle him ? 
Mr. Dursley blinked at the cat . 
It also looked back at him . 
He drove around the corner , went on , and continued to look at the cat through the rearview mirror . 
He was reading the road sign Privet Drive - Oh no , look at the road sign , the cat could not read the road sign or see the map ! 
Mr. Dursley shook his head , chasing the cat out of his mind . 
When driving into the city , he did not want to think of anything other than the expensive drills he wished to have much of that day . 
But coming to the city , suddenly there was one thing that he no longer thought about the drilling machine : while sitting in the car , amid the traffic jam , he could not help but notice that around the very Many dress up strangely . 
All of them were wearing cloaks . 
Mr. Dursley was unbearable for the dressmakers - the haunting things the kids were wearing ! - so he thought this would be a stupid fashion this time . 
He ran his fingers through the steering wheel of his car and his gaze fell on a pair of headless monsters standing nearby . 
They were whispering together as if they were excited . 
Mr. Dursley froze when he noticed that the pair were no longer young : Look , the man looked older than he was , but he was wearing jade blue shirt ! 
Can not do anything ! What is the mind ? 
But Mr. Dursley was startled - it looks like these people are gathering for something , oh , look ! 
The traffic , and a few minutes later Mr. Dursley drove to the Grunnings parking lot , his mind was back on the drilling machines . 
In the office on the ninth floor , Mr. Dursley often sat back to the window . 
Assuming that you do not sit that way , it is very likely that you will hardly be able to concentrate in the morning . 
By sitting so , he did not see , outside the window , a fluttering hover in the middle of the day . 
Everyone in the street saw , but Mr. Dursley did not . 
People are just pointing astonished , even gasp when looking up the flutter flies overhead , many of them have not even seen an owl in the middle of the night , do not say in the middle of the day like this . 
Everybody sees Mr. Dursley alone . 
He had a completely normal morning , with no owls . 
That morning , he yelled five different people . 
He made several important phone calls and screamed again . 
His mood was refreshed until lunch , and he had to stretch his legs slightly , crossing the street , making himself a bread at the bakery . 
He almost forgot about the cloaked ones until he passed a bunch of people near the bakery . 
They all wear a hoodie . 
He looked at them angrily . 
He did not know why , but they annoyed him too . 
These whispers seemed to be very provocative , but he could not hear any words . 
It was only when he was on his way back from the bakery that he came across the men in the cloak that Dursley had heard what they said : 
- The Potter family , that's right . 
I heard that right 
- Oh , their son , Harry 
Mr. Dursley stood dumbfounded . 
He was overwhelmed with fear . 
He looked at the people whispering as if to say something to them , but then again . 
He hurried across the street , rushed to the office , buried his secretary not to disturb him , then picked up the phone , about to call home to return to change his mind . 
He placed the receiver down , his shoulders rattling , thinking No , he was a little map . 
Potter is not a rare one . 
He made sure that there were a bunch of people carrying the Potter family and naming his son Harry . 
Thought to think back carefully , he also not sure his grandson named Harry . 
He never met it . 
Maybe it's Harvey or Harold . 
There was nothing he had to bother about Mrs. Dursley ; She was always angry and upset when she heard about her sister . 
He would not blame her either , he would be the same if he had a sister like that . But his sister or his sister was the same anyway . 
But the cloak ! 
At noon , he suddenly found it hard to concentrate on drilling machines , and when leaving the workplace at five o ' clock , he became so anxious and nervous that he crashed into a person at the door . 
- Sorry ! 
He grunted at the little man he had hit , causing him to nearly fall behind . 
But just a few seconds later , Mr. Dursley suddenly realized that the man was wearing a purple suit . 
He did not seem angry that he nearly rolled to the ground . 
On the contrary , his face widened with a grin , and he spoke in an ambiguous voice that made everyone pass by . 
- do not worry , sir , today nothing can irritate me . 
Cheer up . 
Because who - who - well - know - who - is - has finally turned ! 
Even Muggles like you should celebrate this happy , happy day . 
And the man hugged Mr. Dursley intently and walked away . 
Mr. Dursley stood in the spotlight . 
He was a total stranger embracing one ! 
You are called Muggles , do not know what the devil ? 
He was surprised . 
Hurrying to the car , he drove home , hoping that what happened was just his imagination . 
But in the past , have you ever recognized that there is imagination in life ? 
When the car entered the house number 4 , the first thing he saw - and did not make him easier to breathe at all - was the big wildcat he had seen in the morning . 
The cat was sitting on the edge of the garden wall of his home . 
He must be the right cat in the morning , because around his eyes there is a square shape . 
Mr. Dursley said : 
- Swell . 
The cat did not bother . 
She looked back at him coldly . 
Mr. Dursley wondered . 
Do not know what the usual behavior of cats is ? Trying to regain self - control , he walks into the house . 
He is determined not to say anything to his wife about Potter . 
Ms . Dursley also spent a good day . 
At dinner , she told her husband about the troubles of their neighbors and their daughters , and today Dudley learns that two new words are missing . 
Mr. Dursley tried to behave as usual . 
When Dudley was placed on his bed , he entered the living room to watch the evening news . 
- And lastly , your audience , watchmen all over the place reported that owls across the country have acted unusually well today . 
Although hunters often go hunting at night and rarely appear during the day , but today , early in the morning , there were hundreds of flies flying in all directions . 
Experts can not explain why the change in sleep habits has changed . 
The spokesman said to himself rewarded a smile and continued : 
- Extremely mysterious . 
And now it's Jim McGuffin's weather forecast . 
Will there be any more rain tonight ? 
The weather forecaster replied : 
- Well , I do not know that much , but today is not only the action of monster , but the weather is also unusual . 
Observers in different regions have called me complaining that instead of a rain like I had predicted yesterday , they received a meteor shower . 
Maybe people celebrate the fireworks too early , but my cousin , next week to fireworks ! 
However , I assure you that the weather will be very humid tonight . 
Mr. Dursley sat frozen on the couch . 
Meteors across the sky Britain - sand - benefit ? 
How to fly in the day ? 
The people wearing mysterious cloaks everywhere . 
And the whispering stories about the Potter family 
Mrs. Dursley brought two cups of tea into her room . 
It's not OK . 
You have nothing to say to her . 
He cleared his throat : 
- I have not heard about your sister for a long time ? 
- Are not . 
as he expected , Mrs. Dursley was startled and spat . 
Have not you both been so tacitly assumed she has no sister at all ? 
Her voice was sharp : 
- What ? 
Mr. Dursley elected : 
- Oh , just three laughs . 
Now the meteor has a bunch of bosses taunted in the street today 
- So what ? Mrs. Dursley interrupted . 
Mr. Dursley said , 
- I just thought maybe something had to do with my aunt that she knew it was her aunt 
Mrs. Dursley clicked her lips on the tea . 
Mr. Dursley wondered if he would dare tell his wife that he had heard rumors of Potter's name . Finally he did not dare . 
Instead , he tried to look normal : 
" Their son must be the same age as his little Dudley , are not you ? " 
Mrs. Dursley smiles : 
- Maybe 
- What it's name ? 
Howard right ? 
- Harry . 
An ordinary name ugly . 
- Oh , bad . 
I totally agree with you . 
He did not say any more about the subject when they went upstairs to the bedroom . 
While Mrs. Dursley was in the shower , Mr. Dursley stood by the window overlooking the garden . 
The cat is still there . 
He was chasing Privet Drive like he was waiting for something . 
Or did he just imagine everything ? 
What are all this nonsense about the Potter family ? 
If there was any involvement with the pair , he thought he could not bear it . 
Mrs Dursley went to bed . 
Mrs. Dursley sleeps right away , and Mr. Dursley stays on . 
Finally , a pleasant thought made him fall asleep . If the Potter family was involved in all of this bullshit , they would have no reason not to let the family down . 
The Potter family knew very well how Mrs. Dursley thought about them and the people they were . 
Mr. Dursley saw no reason for himself and his wife to be miserable about what was happening - he yawned and turned away - that could not affect them . 
But he was wrong . 
Mr. Dursley could finally get a sleep , though hardly . 
But the cat sitting on the outside wall was not sleepy . 
He sat motionless , his eyes unblinking at the corner of Privet Drive . 
It does not move even when there is a door slamming across the street . 
Do not budge even when two owls flutter over the top . 
And it was almost midnight that the cat moved . 
It was when an old man appeared at the corner where the cat was looking . 
Appears suddenly and quietly as if from the ground up . The tail of the cat lurched and his eyes narrowed . 
There has never been a bizarre look on Privet Drive ever since . 
Sick , tall , very old , based on the hair and beard so long that they have to hold them back . 
He wore long sleeves , and his long purple sweatshirt was sweeping the ground , though he was wearing lace - up boots . His blue eyes sparkled and sparkled behind the spectacles of moonlight . 
The nose is just as long as the nose has broken at least twice . 
The name of the instrument is Albus Dumbledore . 
Albus Dumbledore does not seem to realize that he has come the way from their name to his boots are not welcome welcome . 
He was busy rummaging through his overcoat , looking for something . 
Then suddenly , it seemed that he realized he was being watched , because he suddenly looked up at the cat still staring at him from the edge of the Dursley Wall . 
The eyes of the child seems to make him interested . 
Tongue tongue muttered : 
- I should know ! 
He found what he had been rummaging through in his cloak . 
It's like a silver lighter . 
Put it up and press . 
The nearest street lamp turns off . 
Press again , the next street light off . 
Twelve times , until the light left on the road was just two glittering spots in the distance - two cat eyes looking at him . 
If anyone was looking out the window at the street now , no matter how impenetrable Dursley eyes would be , could not see what was going on . 
Albus Dumbledore puts the switch - fire on the cloak and heads toward the 4 th Privet Drive . 
He sat down on the edge of the wall , next to the cat . 
You did not look at it , but for a moment , he said : It is nice to meet you here , Professor McGonagall ! 
He turns to smile at the cat , but no cat at all . 
Instead , he was smiling at a decent looking lady , wearing square rim - like glasses around the cat's eyes . 
She also wears jade , jade . 
Her hair grows into a tight bun . 
She has a clear disposition : 
- How did you know the cat was me ? 
" My dear professor , I have never seen a cat sit so rigidly before . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- You sit all day on the edge of the wall , he is also stiff . 
- All day ? Would you be celebrating ? 
On the way , I met at least a dozen party feasts . 
Professor McGonagall breathed angrily and said impatiently : 
- Yes , everyone celebrates , okay . You should have noticed that they should be careful - even the Muggles realized something was going on . 
They announced on the news program there . 
She nodded toward the Dursleys ' dark living - room window . 
- I heard it all . 
Dummies , they are not completely stupid . 
They realized there was something . 
I bet it was Diggle's , he did not have a brain at all . 
Albus Dumbledore said gently : 
- You can not blame it . For eleven years now we have not had a chance to rejoice ! 
Professor McGonagall remains irritable : 
- I know . 
But that's not the reason to go crazy . The crowd gathered indiscriminately on the streets in the middle of the day , not even wearing Muggle clothes to camouflage , and then screaming loudly . 
She glanced at Albus Dumbledore sitting beside him , as if hoping he would tell her something , but she did not say anything , so she continued , 
- If when - who - who - well - know - that - who - that goes away , Muggle people find out how much we know . 
But I'm not sure he's dead yet , Mr. Dumbledore ? 
- Sure it is . 
What a blessing to us ! 
Did you use lemon drops ? 
- What drops ? 
- A lemon drop . It's a Muggle glue that I like . 
- No thanks . 
Professor McGonagall coldly refused , she did not think it was appropriate to sip this candy . 
- As I say , even if - who - well - know - who - is - that has 
- My beloved professor , a brave person like you can call him by his name ? 
I know - who - well - know - who - is - it is nonsense . 
For eleven years I have not told people to call him right after his name : Voldemort ? 
Professor McGonagall frowned . 
But Dumbledore did not seem to mind , he was staring at two sticky candies and he continued : 
- If we keep calling : who - who - well - know - who - is - then everything just messed up . 
I see nothing to fear when called by the name of the rice of Voldemort . 
Professor McGonagall said , anxiety again admired : 
- I know you are not afraid . 
But he is different . 
Everyone knows - who - who - well - know - is fine , called Voldemort away , he is only afraid of him alone . 
Albus Dumbledore calmly said : 
- She flattered me too . 
Voldemort has the power I never had . 
- It was only because he was so great , so he was not using that power . 
- Fortunately , it's dark . 
For a long time I have not blushed , since Pomfrey once said it was my earlobe . 
Professor McGonagall glared at Dumbledore's gaze . 
- The owls hovered around waiting for the news . 
Do you know what people are saying ? Why did he have to leave ? 
About what stopped him ? 
It seems Professor McGonagall has ruled the point that she wants to debate . That was the reason why she had to wait all day on this hard and lurid wall . 
Apparently what people were talking about , no matter what , she did not believe until Dumbledore told her that it was true . 
Dumbledore , however , was busy picking up another candy , not answering . 
" The thing they were discussing , " McGonagall insisted , " was Voldemort last night to the Goddess . 
He found the Potter family . 
Rumor has it that the Potter couple are already , they are rumors , are dead ! 
Dumbledore bowed . 
Professor McGonagall gasped , choking : 
- Potter wife I can not believe I do not want to believe Oh , Mr. Dumbledore 
Dumbledore stretched his hand on the professor's shoulder , who slowly said , 
- I know I know 
Professor McGonagall's trembling continued : 
- That's not the end . 
They even said he tried to kill Potter's son , Harry . 
But he did not kill him > He could not kill the baby . 
No one knows why , but they say that when Harry can not be killed , Voldemort's power is dissipated . 
So he must also go away . 
Dumbledore nodded sadly . 
Professor McGonagall stammered : 
- That's true ? 
How many echoes have he killed , that he can not kill a boy ? 
I can not believe what's blocking his hand . But how did Harry survive ? 
Dumbledore said : 
- We can only guess . 
It never knows exactly . 
Professor McGonagall pulled out a handkerchief wiping her tears under her glasses . 
Dumbledore sighed in a loud voice as he pulled the gold watch out of his pocket . 
The clock is very old . 
It has twelve needles but no numbers . 
Instead of small planetary numbers moving around the clock . 
But Dumbledore must have seen the clock , so when he put it back in his pocket , he said , 
- Hagrid is late . 
Sure enough , he told her I was here , right ? 
- it's correct . 
Professor McGonagall confirmed and continued : 
- You do not even want to tell me why you came here ? 
- I came here to deliver Harry Potter to his aunt . 
Now it is only they are relatives . 
Professor McGonagall jumped up , pointing to No . 4 house : 
- What do you say ? 
You do not mean to mention some people living in it ? 
Dumbledore , you can not do that . 
I watched them all day . 
Can not you find someone better than them ? 
They also had a son . 
I saw that little boy , he kicked his mother all the way to the candy store , crying out for candy . 
Harry Potter that must come to live here ? 
Dumbledore asserted : 
- this is the best place for the baby . 
When it grows its aunt can explain it . 
I wrote them a letter . 
- A letter ? 
Professor McGonagall repeated weakly , dropping himself to the wall , wondering , 
- Mr. Dumbledore , do you really believe you can explain everything in a letter ? 
They will never understand the baby ! 
It will be famous - as a myth . 
I would not be surprised if people call this day Harry Potter : there will be books about Harry . 
Every child in our world will know its name ! 
- right . 
Dumbledore's eyes widened through his pair of sunglasses , saying , 
- It's enough to harm any child's mind . 
Famous before knowing when to go speak ! 
Famous for things that it can not remember yet ! 
You do not see how much better it is if it grows out of the cover of fame , grows normally until it's big enough to master it ? 
Professor McGonagall opened his mouth , changed his mind , swallowed , shut his mouth and said , 
- Yes , of course you are right . 
But Dumbledore , how could the baby come here ? 
The professor stared at Dumbledore's cloak as if she thought she was hiding the baby in it . 
Dumbledore said : 
- Hagrid is bringing it . 
" Do you think giving Hagrid such an importance as this is wise ? " 
- I can give my whole life to Hagrid . 
McGonagall is still unhappy : 
" I'm not saying Hagrid does not know what to do , but you know he's a liar . " 
What is this ? 
A deep bass sounded around them , sounding louder , louder and louder . 
They both looked out into the street with the lights on , and then the sound of thunderous sounds made both of them look up to the sky : a giant motorcycle running in the air and down , rolling on the pavement . plastic in front of them . 
If the motorcycle is too big , it is not as good as the person sitting on the car . 
He was almost twice as tall as a normal person and had five times as many , if he were to be counted horizontally . 
He was so big that he could hardly believe it , and was wild again . 
The black hair of the black beard almost covered his face , his hands looked like crane , and his legs were like a baby piglet . 
In the hands of a burlap is a knotted profile . 
Dumbledore said calmly , 
- Hagrid , he finally came . 
Where did you get that car ? 
The giant climbed out of the car and said , 
- Dear Professor Dumbledore , I borrowed from Sirius Black . 
Sir , I brought the boy here . 
- Are there any troubles ? 
- Sir . 
The house was almost deserted , but I had to get it out before the Muggles started pouring around . flying to it , it fell asleep . 
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall leaned over the blankets . 
Inside the blanket was the sleeping baby . 
On the child's forehead there is a small lightning bolt wound . 
Professor McGonagall whispered : 
- Is that it 
- Yes , it will carry that scar all the time . 
- You can not delete it Dumbledore ? 
- If I can do it , I will not do anything . 
Scars also come to use . 
I also have a scar on my knee , which is as valuable as a streetcar map in London . 
Well , Hagrid , put it here , we should finish this for now . 
Dumbledore took Harry to the Dursleys . 
Hagrid stammered : 
- Can I kiss the baby goodbye ? 
The end of the furrow fluttered against the baby's face and his old beard stubble on the baby's skin . 
Then suddenly Hagrid spoke out as a wounded dog . 
Professor McGonagall recalls : 
- Xu ! 
He woke up the Muggles now . 
Hagrid sobbed : 
- Sorry , hic hic . 
But I can not hic . 
The Potter family is dead , and little Harry has to go to the Muggle . 
Cry . 
Professor McGonagall patted : 
- yes , sad , but try to cry , Hagrid , we are not alone . 
Hagrid struggled with emotion , standing beside Professor McGonagall , watching Dumbledore follow Harry Potter through the garden to the front door of the Dursleys , gently put the baby down on the door , grabbed a letter in his shirt , The letter under the blanket wrapped around the baby , then back to the other two . 
The three of them stood silent for a moment to see the blanket wrapped around the baby . 
Hagrid's shoulders fluttered , Professor McGonagall's eyes flashing constantly , and the glittering light that often flashed from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to shut off . 
Finally Dumbledore said : 
- Well , that's it . 
We have nothing left here . 
Maybe we go to party with other people . 
- Yes . " Hagrid said loudly . - I ' ll bring Sirius back to this car . 
Hello Professor McGonagall , and good morning , Professor Dumbledore . 
Hagrid jumped on his face , jumped into the car , and threw a heavy blow to the engine . Then he roared into the air as black as a button . 
Dumbledore's last greetings to Mrs. McGonagall : 
- I look forward to seeing you again , Professor McGonagall . 
Professor McGonagall blows his nose in response . 
Dumbledore stepped down the street . 
At the corner of the road , he stopped walking , took a shirt in the coat cover - fire silver . 
He held up one of them , then twelve , immediately twelve light bulbs on Privet Drive lit up , but did not catch up to the shadow of a huge wildcat running across the bend at the other end . Street . 
Left alone , Dumbledore looked at the last blanket on the doorstep of No . 4 . 
He said : 
- Good luck , Harry . 
Then the shirt overflows with a disappearing instrument . 
A wind blows through the green fence of the house on Privet Drive . 
The tidy house and the barricades are the last place one can expect a strange thing to happen . 
Harry Potter turns himself in the blanket without waking up . 
A small fist of her placed on the letter near her , and 
She did not know for a few hours that Mrs. Dursley would wake her up with a shriek as she opened the door to empty bottles of milk . The child did not know that he would become a toy for his cousin , Dudley , who had torn it for several weeks . The baby did not know anything about it at this time , this time around the country , partying is going on , people raise the glass of praise : Drink to Harry Potter ! the baby is still alive ! 
Chapter 02 : GLASS DISEASES 
It's been ten years since the Dursleys woke up to find the nephew on the doorstep , but Privet Drive did not change at all . 
The sun rises and radiates the bronze number 4 on the Dursleys door . 
The sun came into the living room almost as before , when Dursley sat watching the fateful news of the owls . 
Only the pictures hanging by the fireplace are changed by the year . 
Ten years ago there were countless pictures of a baby looking like a round ball on the beach , wearing colorful bow ties . 
But now Dudley is no longer a chubby baby , and the photos now show a blond boy riding his first bike , riding a Ferris wheel at a fair , playing a game . with a daddy , or being cuddled by his mother There is no sign in the room that another baby is living in it . 
But Harry Potter was there , with a short nap , but not how long . 
Aunt Petunia , just as Dursley , had just woken up and made her first sound of the day in a low voice : 
- Get up ! 
Get up now ! 
Harry woke up . 
His aunt hit the door again . 
- Get up ! 
Her voice shrieked . 
Harry heard her feet go to the kitchen and then the pan was placed on the stove . 
He lay back , remembering his dream last night . 
What a beautiful dream . 
In that dream , he saw a flying motorbike . 
It has a sense of emptiness , that it seemed to dream of it before . 
She stood outside the door to call : 
- Do you get up ? 
- Coming soon . 
- Come out , I need you to watch the salty meat . 
You can kill it if it burns . 
I want everything to be perfect on Dudley's birthday . 
Harry yawned . 
His aunt poked open the door : 
- What did you say ? 
- Where do not say anything 
Dudley's birthday . 
How can it forget ? 
Harry slowly got out of bed , began to pick up socks . 
It found a couple under the bed . 
After dusting and spider webbing , it was wearing socks . 
Harry was very familiar with the spiders , because the room under the stairs had a lot of spiders , and it was his sleepy . 
Dressed up , Harry walks down the corridor to the kitchen . 
The table was filled with Dudley's birthday present . 
It looks like Dudley has got the new computer it claims , another TV , and a racing bike . 
Why Dudley naturally demanded a race bike was a secret to Harry , because Dudley was fussy and hated to speak out , except for the sport of pinching the other person . Dudley is Harry , but rarely does he get Harry . 
Harry did not seem agile , but when he was chased by Dudley , it escaped quickly and strangely . 
Perhaps because of living in the darkened room under the stairs , Harry was a little bit thinner than his real age . It looked so sick and smaller than it really was because it always had to wear Dudley's old clothes , and Dudley was four times bigger than him . 
Harry had a thin face , strong limbs , black hair , bright blue eyes . 
He wears a pair of glasses with tape over his broken shoulder several times as Dudley punches Harry in the middle of his nose . 
The only thing Harry was happy about was his scar in the center of his forehead was a lightning bolt . 
It has been wearing that scar for a long time , since it can not remember anymore . 
She only remembered the first time she asked Aunt Petunia how he got that scars , she said : 
- In the car crash caused the three mother brows died . 
Do not ask again , hear ? 
Not asked - it is the first principle to live comfortably in the Dursleys . 
Uncle Vernon , Mr. Dursley , walked into the kitchen as Harry turned over the salt . 
Uncle it a sentence like morning greetings : 
- comb your hair ! 
About once a week , Uncle Vernon raised his eyes from the unpublished newspaper to shout at Harry that he needed to cut his hair . 
It must have been the hair cut of the boys in the class was not as much of Harry's , but that did not make his head much different , his hair growing up like the old , all over his head . 
When Harry came to the egg , Dudley and his mother appeared at the kitchen door . 
The boy looks exactly like his father : his face is pinkish , his neck is not tall , his eyes are blue , his thick blond hair is brushed on his fat head . 
Aunt Petunia often said Dudley looked like a natural baby , and Harry often said Dudley looked like a pig in a piglet . 
Harry put the salted egg and salt on the table , the table almost no vacant space because of the birthday gift of Dudley . 
It is counting the gifts . 
His face fell , and he looked at his cheeks : 
- There are thirty six . 
Less than two gift last year 
- Baby , I counted Miss Marge's present , and then , it was under the big package of the parents . 
Dudley blushed . 
- Well , only thirty - seven . 
Having witnessed Dudley's whore many times , Harry hurried to eat his salty meat as quickly as possible in case Dudley threw up the table . 
Aunt Petunia obviously felt that danger , so she said , 
- The parents will buy two more gifts for children when they go to play this meal . be married ? 
Two more gifts ? 
Dudley thought for a moment . 
It looks so hard to think . 
Finally it speaks slowly : 
- Things will be thirty thirty 
- Thirty - nine , your mother's love . 
Dudley sat down and grabbed the nearest gift : 
- Yeah , that's it . 
Uncle Vernon rubbed his son's head : 
- Young to know the accuracy . 
Damn your son , Dudley . 
At that , the phone rang , Aunt Petunia went to the phone , Harry and Uncle Vernon sat watching Dudley open the presents : far from the bike , shooting , remote control , sixteen new video games , and a machine . video . 
He was stripped from a gold wristwatch , Petunia returned to the table , angry and worried . 
- Too bad Vernon . 
Mrs. Figg broke her leg , she did not take it . 
She nodded at Harry . 
Dudley's mouth was filled with horror , but Harry's heart leapt . 
Every year on Dudley's birthday , his parents brought him and his friends to go out all day , to the amusement park , to the restaurant or to the theater . 
On that occasion , Harry was sent home at Mrs. Figg's house . 
Harry hated her , for Mrs. Figg was an indecisive old man living two blocks away . At home was the smell of cabbage , and Mrs. Figg kept catching pictures of her cats . 
- Now what ? 
Aunt Petunia said while looking at Harry furiously as if he was planning to commit the affair . 
Harry figured he should have broken Mrs. Figg's leg , but when she thought about not seeing her cats , it was not easy to hold back the joy of the moment . 
Uncle Vernon suggested : 
" We can call Mr. Marge . 
- Do not be mad . 
God hates the boy . 
Although Harry was still sitting in front of them , the Dursleys kept talking about it as if it were not present , or as if it were something incomprehensible to them , a snail . 
- What about your friend , Miss Yvonne ? 
- vacation in Majorca then . 
Harry rekindled his hope : 
- Auntie to leave you at home 
( So ​​ he could watch the TV show he liked to change his taste , and maybe he could scratch Dudley's computer . ) But Aunt Petunia rolled her eyes , as if she had just swallowed a lemon . choking : 
- to let this house mismatched you ? 
- I did not blow up the house . 
Said Harry , but no one listened . 
Aunt Petunia said slowly : 
- Or take him to the zoo with him but let him sit in the car ? 
Uncle Vernon objected immediately : 
- The brand new car , who dare let it sit alone in it ! 
Dursley began to cry aloud . 
In fact , he pretends to cry ( the last time he cried the last few years ) , but he knew that if he grinned , his mother would give him whatever he wanted . 
She wrapped her arms around her . 
- Do not cry , Dudley's mom . 
I do not let it spoil your happy day . 
Dudley faked and screamed : 
- I do not .. let it go together . 
Through the gap between her mother's arms , Dudley grinned at Harry . 
Suddenly the doorbell rang . 
Aunt Petunia cried out : 
- Oh , my God , my guests are coming . 
Only a moment later , Dudley's best friend Piers Polkiss came in with his mother . 
Piers is a kid with a face like a mouse . 
It is often the hand that holds Harry's hand for Dudley's punch . 
Dursley stopped crying at once . 
In the following hours , Harry could not believe his luck came to him : he was sitting in the car with the Dursleys on his way to the zoo for the first time in his life . 
Aunt and Uncle Dursley could not think of any other way to solve it , but before leaving , Vernon dragged it out , bent over his big pink face to his face and instructed : 
- I tell you before : You do not play any evil game , any game , you will also be locked in the niche from here until Christmas , remember ? 
Harry said , 
- I will not do anything 
But Uncle Vernon did not believe . 
From now on no one will ever trust Harry . 
That's because there are always strange things going on around it , and it's completely useless to make the Dursleys believe that these things are not Harry's . 
For once , Aunt Petunia took the scissors to cut the hair on Harry's head , causing her head to shine . 
I only leave a cap on my forehead , as she says to cover the horrible scar . 
It was irritating to see Harry go to the barber shop , but his head was still as shabby as never being trimmed . 
That day Dudleyb was given a laugh to hiccup and Harry was awake all night , suffering miserable the next day to school . 
At school with Dudley's wide stock of clothes and glasses , it was a pastime for the others . 
But the next morning when Harry got up , his hair was still the same as before Aunt Petunia shaved . 
Because of this sin , Harry was locked up in the stairs for a week even though he tried to explain that it was impossible to explain how his hair grew so fast . 
Then another time , Aunt Petunia caught Harry wearing Dudley's sweater and walked away . 
The brown shirt with the orange knots looks horribly horrible . 
Harry did not like it at all , but Aunt Petunia was wearing his headband . 
The closer she pulled the shirt , the smaller the shirt , finally the shirt just big enough to wear a doll with fist , and of course not fit with Harry . 
Aunt Petunia thought that because of the laundry , the shirt was shrunken , so Harry was not punished . 
But it turned out to be a big deal once it was seen sitting on the roof of the school kitchen . 
That day Dudley's band was chasing Harry as always , when Harry ran out of reach and fell into the hands of the children to see one escape , I was on the roof . 
The children were also astounded . 
And Mr. and Mrs. Dursley received a letter from the principal because Harry had climbed onto the roof of the house to play . 
Harry tried to explain to Uncle Vernon , by screaming loudly through the keyhole of the closet under the stairs , that he was about to jump over the large trash can in the kitchen . 
He guessed that when making that leap , the wind blew it on the roof . 
But today , no matter what happens . 
Today is worth keeping to go out with Dudley and Piers in another place - not the school , not the stairs , or Mrs. Figg's cabbage house . 
Just driving , Uncle Vernon had complained to Aunt Petunia . 
He likes to complain about things : the people at work , the city council , Harry , the bank , and Harry are some of the topics he likes to complain the most . 
Also this morning , the subject of his complaint was about the motorcycle . 
- Scream like crazy , things are out of teaching . 
He said when a motorcycle overtook them . 
Harry suddenly remembered his dream and blurted out : 
- I have a dream of a motorcycle . 
It flies . 
Uncle Vernon narrowly drove into the car ahead . 
He twirled in a chair to scream at Harry , his face at that moment looked like a giant red beet : 
- MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT FLOATING ! 
Dudley and Piers laugh at each other . 
Harry said : 
- I know it does not fly . 
Just a dream . 
But do not say it better . In the Dursleys , when it was questioned , it was hated ; But do not hate it when it talks about things that are not normal , whether it's a dream or a cartoon . 
It seems they are afraid Harry will be infected with dangerous bizarre ideas . 
It was a beautiful Saturday and the zoo led families to take their children out . 
The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers each of them a large chocolate ice cream set right in the gate , and because before they could hurry Harry away , she tried smiling Harry asking him He wanted to eat ice cream , they just bought him a cheap lemon ice cream . 
Not so bad . 
Harry thought as he reached for his ice cream when all of them stood watching an orangutan scratch his head . 
Harry looked like Dudley orangutan although his hair is not yellow . 
Harry had such a beautiful morning . 
He carefully crossed the Dursleys for a while so that Dudley and Piers could not find a way to handle it . 
The two boys seemed to be bored of the beasts . 
As they sat in the zoo's restaurant , Dudley smashed his umbrella table as his cake did not have the cream he demanded , Uncle Vernon bought it another , and Harry enjoyed the cake . enough ice cream . 
After all , Harry still felt that it was as beautiful as a dream . 
After lunch , they come to the reptile farm . 
Inside cool and dark , only light along the window to the wall . Behind the broken glass , all kinds of snakes crawl around rocks or logs . 
Dudley and Piers would like to see giant cobras poisonous , and pythons ( also huge ) can be deadly . 
Dudley quickly found the place of the largest snake zoo . 
It was so big that it could wrap two rounds around Mr. Dursley's car and squeeze the crushed car like an old trash can . 
But at that moment the snake did not seem interested in doing it , it was sleeping . 
Dudley stuck the mosquito close to the glass window , staring at the glossy brown roll . 
She pleaded with her father : 
- Make it move . 
Mr. Dursley patted the glass , but the coyote was lying still . 
Dudley hybrid : 
- Do it again . 
Mr. Dursley clapped his guarded hand on the glass , but the snake pretended to be deaf or deaf . 
Dudley cleared his throat : 
- I'm bored . 
Harry went to stand where Dudley had gone , staring at the snake . 
If the snake died of boredom , Harry would not be surprised . 
Thought no one would vote for you except the idiot who knocked on the glass to distract him all the time . 
It was worse than being in the closet under the stairs , where only Aunt Petunia came to the door and woke up , at least in the kitchen or in the garden . 
Suddenly the serpent opened his eyes , his eyes like two glass balls . 
And then it was quiet , and he raised his head until his eyes were on Harry's level . 
He winked . 
Harry looked at the serpent . 
Then he glanced around to see if anyone was watching . 
No , Harry looked at the snake and winked at it . 
The snake nodded at Dudley and Dursley , raised his gaze to the ceiling and gave Harry a meaningful look : 
- I'm so confused . 
Harry whispered through the glass , though not sure if the snake could hear : 
- I know . 
It must be annoying . 
Snake nodded Harry's head . 
- By the way , where are you from ? 
The snake curled its tail pointing to the plate next to the glass . 
Harry reads : 
Boa constrictor , Brazil . 
- The country is beautiful ? 
Boa constrictor again pointed at the plaque again and Harry continued reading : This animal was born in the zoo . 
- I understand that you have never been to Brazil ? 
The snake shook its head , just as a scream rang out behind Harry , causing both it and the snake to shoot . 
- DUDLEY ! DURSLEY ! LAI HAS THIS SONG ! CAN NOT BELIEVE IT IS HACKED TO DO IT ! 
Dudley rushed forward . 
He punched Harry in the ribs . 
- You avoided me . 
Unexpectedly , Harry fell to the concrete floor . What happened next was so fast that no one could see how it had happened : First off , Dudley and Piers stared out at the glass , closing off the second , they bounced back and forth . freaking . 
Harry sat up stunned . 
Boa constrictor has disappeared . 
The giant snake was swarming on the school floor . 
Everyone in the reptile shrieked and ran away to the door . 
As the serpent passed by , Harry sounded like a deep bass voice resounded : 
- I am Brazil , thank you very much , my friend . 
The custodian of the reptile died away , stamping up forever : 
- But where is the glass cover of the glass ? 
The director of the zoo personally made a bold tea for Dursley , apologetically disturbed . 
Dudley and Piers are almost a dozen . 
As Harry witnessed , the snake did nothing but juggle the air as the school passed them . 
But once safely in Dursley's car , Dudley began to tell the snake nearly hit his crutches , and Piers was as if the snake was missing only a few seconds before he had squeezed it . live . 
But the most horrible thing about Harry was when Piers recovered and said : 
- Hey , Harry , you were talking to him , were not you ? 
Mr. Dursley waited until Piers completely left his house and turned to Harry . 
He was so angry that he did not utter a word , only panted for a few words : 
- To - roar the stairs - there - fasting . 
Then he fell on the couch , and Dursley hurried to give him a large glass of wine . 
Harry lay in the room under the stairs for a long time . 
He did not know what time it was , and it was not sure if the Dursleys had fallen asleep . 
They do not dare to risk their life in the kitchen to find something to eat . 
He had been living in the Dursleys for almost ten years , ten years in misery , since he was a baby and his parents died in a car accident , as it was known . 
He could not remember what had happened to him , in the car that had caused his parents to die . Sometimes , at times punished in the stairs for hours , he squeezes his mind to remember and glimpses a strange image : a blue light flashes from his eyes and a sharp pain in the middle of his forehead . 
It was caused by a collision , but it did not imagine where the blue light came from . 
She could not remember anything about her parents either . 
I do not tell Dursley anything about them at all . 
It is of course forbidden to ask . 
There was no photo of Harry's cheeks in the Dursleys . 
When Harry was even smaller , he dreamed of dreaming a dream brought by another cousin , leaving him out of the Dursleys . 
But that never happened : Dursley was the only family to use it . 
Nevertheless , sometimes it is thought ( or hopefully ) that there are strangers on the street who know it . 
A young man with a purple cap congratulated him once he followed the three Dursleys and Dudley went shopping . 
Mrs. Dursley asked angrily if she was accustomed to the old man , and then dragged the children out of the shop without having to shop . 
There was an old woman who looked wild , dressed in green , cheerfully waved it on the bus . 
Then there was a bald man in a long purple jacket who shook his hand on the street the other day , and walked away without saying a word . The strangest of these people is that when Harry wants to come near them , they seem to disappear in the blink of an eye ! 
At school Harry had no friends . 
Everyone knows that Dudley's tape hates Harry Potter's sloppy , sloppy glasses and broken - up glasses . 
They do not want to corrupt Dudley's heart . 
Chapter 03 : LETTERS NOT MISSING 
The Brazilian Constrictor's escape made Harry the longest penalty ever . 
When Harry was allowed to get out of the stairs , the summer was over and Dudley broke his new camcorder , crushed the remote control , and Mrs. Figg was tackling the ice . By the way , when she was riding her first bike , her grandmother collapsed . 
Harry was glad that the school year was over , but could not quite get rid of Dudley's band , so they came home every day . 
Piers , Dennis , Malcolm , and Gordon all had big bodies and tiny heads , but Dudley was the biggest and dumbest of them , and should be the leader . 
Dudley's favorite sport is the hunt for Harry Potter . 
This is the reason that harry often leave the house , wandering somewhere and thinking about the thought is about to end . 
Thinking about it , he saw a glimpse of hope : he would not be in middle school in September , and for the first time in his life , he would have to go to 9 I to study with Dudley . Dursley studied in the past , Smelting school , Piers also school . 
But Harry , on the other hand , will not be in the local public school , Wall Street . 
Dudley thinks so . 
She told Harry : 
- At the Walls School , they put people on a toilet seat on the day of school . 
Do you want to go upstairs ? 
- No , thank you . 
Your dearly hungry brat has so many terrible things in your head - your head is ragged . 
After saying this , Harry ran away before Dudley made his way to his head . 
One day in July , Dursley took Dudley to London to buy a Smelting uniform for him . 
Harry was sent to Mrs. Figg to watch . 
This time Mrs. Figg is not bad . 
It turned out that her cats had broken her leg , so now she seems to lose interest in cats . 
She allowed Harry to sit on television and give him a piece of chocolate cake that tasted like it had been made many years ago . 
That evening , Dudley , in his new uniform , drove around the living room for his parents to watch . 
The Smelting Boys wear a dark brown tunic , orange trousers , and a straw hat called a bumblebee . 
They also hold a stick , used to block each other when the teacher does not keep an eye on . This can be regarded as a good training for their later life . 
Watching Dudley wear new clothes , Mr Dursley said this was the proud moment of his life . 
Dursley cried and said she could not believe that Dudley was so grown up and so handsome . 
And Harry was forbidding himself to say it . 
He knew that two of his ribs dared to break because of his grin . 
The next morning , Harry walked into the kitchen and smelled a terrible smell . 
Looks like the smell came from a large pot . 
He walked up to look at one . 
The pot filled with something that looked like a rakish hue in the gray water village . 
He asked Aunt Petunia : 
- What ? 
His lips tightened as Harry dared to ask a question . 
She said : 
- your new uniform . 
Harry looked at the pots again . 
It says : 
- Oh , I do not mind it is embedded in the data . 
Aunt Petunia : 
Idiot 
I'm dying Dudley's old gray for you . 
I dye it out so it looks like the new one . 
Harry was very suspicious of that , but thought he was not arguing the best . 
He sat down next to the dining table , trying not to think of the picture in the suit , going to the Wall School on the new school year . 
Maybe it looks like an old elephant skin . 
Harry's new uniform makes Dudley and Uncle Vernon wrinkle their noses as they walk into the kitchen . 
Mr. Dursley , as usual , opened the newspaper and Dudley raised his Smelting stick on the table . 
Now it goes where it also embankment stick . 
They heard the door open and the letters fell on the mats at the door . 
Mr. Dursley said behind the newspaper : 
- Dudley take the letter to me . 
- Hug Harry . 
- Harry , take the letter . 
- Asked Dudley to get married . 
- smashing him with a smelting stick , Dudley . 
Harry swiftly dodged the Smelting stick and went out the door to get the letter . 
There were three letters on the carpet : a postcard by Dursley's sister , she was traveling on the Isle of Wight , a brown envelope like a utility bill , and a letter to Harry . 
Harry held up , staring at the letter , his heart beating as if there was a huge rubber band playing . 
In his life , from now on , no one ever wrote to him . 
Who wrote ? 
He has no friends , no other relatives . 
It does not borrow books from the library , so even the letter requesting overdue borrowing is out of the question . 
Yet this letter , clearly marked on the envelope , can not be confused at all : 
Harry Potter 
Slip under the stairs 
4 Privet Drive 
The thick and heavy envelope , made of golden leather , and the address is written in blue ink . 
Letter is not stamped . 
Harry's hands trembled as he flipped through the letter , seeing a purple wax seal bearing a badge : a lion , an eagle , a jaw , and a snake wrapped around his alphabet . 
Mr. Dursley said in the kitchen , 
- Hurry up , man . 
What are you doing out there checking the mail bomb ? 
He delighted in his funny humor . 
Harry returned to the kitchen , still gazing at the letter he had sent . 
She handed Dursley a letter asking for water and a postcard , then sat down , slowly opening the yellow envelope . 
Mr. Dursley ripped the envelope , snorted at the scorn , and glanced at the postcard . 
He told Mrs. Dursley : 
- Miss Marge is sick . 
Eat the vinegar 
- Three . 
Dudley suddenly screamed . 
- What the hell are the three of you ? 
At that moment Harry was about to open his letter , a letter written on parchment like an envelope . 
But Mr Dursley's porcelain hand grabbed the letter . 
Harry yelled , trying to retrieve the letter : 
- Your letter . 
Mr. Dursley : 
- Who wrote to you ? 
He shook the letter with one hand and glanced at it . 
Wearing him from red to green was faster than street lights . 
That does not stop there . 
Within seconds , it becomes white as powder . 
He stammered : 
- Petunia 
He is calling his wife's name . 
Dudley tried to take the letter , but Dursley held it out of reach of his son . 
Mrs. Dursley took the letter , curiously reading the first line . 
She fainted . 
She hugged her chest panting : 
- Brother Vernon . 
Good heavens - Brother Vernon . 
They glared at each other , seemingly forgetting that Dudley and Harry were still there . 
Dudley did not despise such a thing . 
He taps his father's head with Smeltings , and yells : 
- I want to read that letter . 
Harry exclaimed , 
- I want to read that letter , because it's a letter to me . 
Mr. Dursley stuffed the letter into the envelope and grumbled : 
- You two go out all . 
Harry refuses to move . He yells : 
- PAID THE LETTER TO THE CHILD . 
Dudley also shouted : 
- Let me take that picture . 
Mr. Dudley roared : 
- GO ! 
He grabbed both of them and threw them out the hall , slamming the kitchen door . 
Dudley and Harry immediately fought each other quietly , but their head was swollen to catch the key . 
Dudley won , so Harry lay flat on the floor to hear his ear through the door . 
The pair of glasses plunged into their ears after the fight with Dudley . 
Inside the kitchen , Mrs. Dudley's voice was trembling : 
" Mr. Vernon looked at the address . " How could they know where he sleeps ? 
Do you see them snooping around your house ? 
Mr. Dudley murmured , bewildered : 
- Snooping around , maybe watching us . 
" But what do you do , Vernon ? " 
Did I answer the letter ? 
Please write to them that you do not want to 
Through the door , Harry could see Mr. Dursley's dark - heeled shoes crossing on the kitchen floor . 
Finally he said : 
- No . 
I keep the body . 
If they do not receive a reply , then it's best not to answer , do not do anything 
- But 
- Petunia , I do not want one in this house . 
Did not we swear to ban that crazy insane door when we adopted it ? 
That afternoon , Mr. Dursley had done something he had always wanted to do : he went down the stairs to meet Harry . 
Having seen Dursley stick his head in , Harry asked immediately : 
- Where's your letter ? 
Who wrote to me ? 
Mr. Dursley said curtly : 
- No one wrote . 
Wrong address . 
I burned . 
Harry said , 
- where is wrong . 
It clearly straddles the stairwell under the stairs . 
- IM ! 
Dursley screamed at the spiders from the ceiling . 
He inhaled a few deep breaths and forced himself to grin , a very painful smile . 
- Oh , yes , Harry , the room under the stairs . 
My aunt and uncle have been thinking , and I am now a little older than my aunt can see if I move to Dudley's bedroom . 
- Why ? 
Mr. Dursley crowned : 
- Prohibition . 
Get furniture upstairs . 
The Dudley House has four rooms : a room for Dursley , a guest room ( usually Marge , Dursley's sister ) , a room for Dudley to sleep , and a room for Dudley to store all the belongings . You can not play it in the bedroom . 
Harry's belongings are just a hug . 
He sat on the bed , in a real bedroom and looked around intently . 
Almost anything is broken as well as broken . 
The less than a month - old film camera rested on the tank where Dudley once hit a neighbor's dog . 
In one corner was Dudley's first television . 
It rocked the screen when the program it liked to stop screening . 
There was a bird droppings , one of which trapped Dudley in exchange for a gun . 
The gun was now wrapped around the shelf and curled up by Dudley's crush . 
On the shelves filled with books , and it was the only thing in the room that seemed to have never been touched . 
Dudley's downstairs voice was saying to her mother : 
- I do not want it there I need that room to get rid of it 
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed . 
Yesterday it was ready to trade anything to be in this room . 
Today it would rather stay under the stairs with its letter , than to be above without a letter . 
At breakfast the next morning , people are a little quiet . 
Dudley was shocked . 
He cried , smacked his father with Smelting sticks , pretended to be sick , kicked his mother's throat , threw his turtle through the glass hut , and still did not recover the room . 
Harry was thinking of this yesterday and bitterly sorry he did not open the letter when he was in the hallway . 
Aunt and uncle are still looking at each other together 
Another letter arrived , Mr. Dursley told Dudley to take . 
He was trying to be kind to Harry . 
They hear Dudley's loud smirting in the corridor . 
Then they heard it scream : 
" Another one , Harry Potter , the smallest bedroom , No . 4 Privet Drive 
Dursley chuckled , jumping out of the chair , running to the corridor , with Harry following him . 
Dursley landed Dudley on the ground in a very painful way , because Harry also stiffened his neck to get his letter . 
After a minute of hand - tripping , he was also poked at several Smelting sticks , and Dursley finally straightened up , grabbed his breath as he grabbed Harry's letter . 
He whispered to Harry : 
- Go to the stairs - Well , the saying is about the bedroom . 
And Dudley , go away . 
Harry walks around in his new room . 
Someone already knew that it had moved from the stairwell under the stairs to this room and it seemed as though he knew it had not received the letter . 
They will definitely send it back . 
Next time Harry will get it . 
He devises a plan . 
The old alarm clock crashed at 6 am the next morning . 
Harry broke off the ring and quietly put on his clothes . 
He tried not to get the Dursley family up . 
She flew down the stairs , not turning on the light . 
It counts toward the corner of Privet Drive waiting for him to deliver the letter . 
But while he was exploring the darkness of the corridor to the door , he stepped on something soft , hard and hard to hear : 
- Asia and Oceania . 
Harry jumped into the air . 
The pile of flushes that door is something alive ! 
With the light from downstairs , Harry was shocked to realize that among the heaps was the face of Uncle Vernon . 
Mr. Dursley lay right in the doorway and slept in a sleeping bag last night , apparently preventing Harry from doing what he had planned . 
He yelled at Harry for another hour and then told him to go to the kitchen to make tea . 
Harry miserably walked into the kitchen and when it came back the letter came , lying on Mr. Dursley's lap . 
Harry could see three letters written in blue ink . 
He just said , 
- I want to 
Mr. Dursley had tore his letters in a hundred pieces in front of him . 
He did not go to work that day . 
He was at home to close the door to the door . 
He explained to his wife : 
- You know ? 
They can not give the letter anymore , they have to finish the game . 
Mrs. Dursley endorsed : 
" You must be successful , Vernon . 
With a nail in his hand , Dursley said , 
- Oh , their minds are bizarre , not our minds . 
On Friday , a letter was sent to Harry . 
Because the letters can not be ignored , they are swung open under the door , the sides of the door , and some of the letters are passed through a small window in the bathroom on the ground floor . 
Mr. Dursley stayed home one day . 
After he burned the letters , he took the hammer and nails of all the cracks in the house , along the front and back doors , so that no one could go out . 
He had just done the mantle of the teardrop through the cotton garden , and as soon as he heard a small noise he jumped up . 
By Saturday , things start to fall out of his reach . 
Twenty - four letters to Harry were rolled up and sealed in two eggs , which the delivery man was so confused as he passed through Dursley's living room window . 
Mr. Dursley frantically called the post office and the egg shop to find out the culprit , or make someone to complain . 
Mrs. Dursley rubbed the letters in her food grinder . 
Dudley asked in surprise : 
- Who in this world want to contact you so ? 
On Sunday morning , Mr. Dursley sat at the breakfast table , looking tired and sick , but happy . 
He excitedly told his wife and children when he jotted the newspaper : 
- Today no delivery letter . 
Not worry about those dead letters . 
But he had not finished the sentence , something fell from the chimney into the fireplace , bouncing and shot in his neck . 
The next three dozen letters flushed down the chimney like fires . 
Dursley's panicked looking for shelter . 
Harry jumped up and got a letter . 
But Mr. Dursley grabbed his wrist and threw it out into the hallway . 
- PLEASE ! 
Mrs Dursley and her son Dudley also covered their heads with their hands running out . 
Mr. Dursley slammed the door shut . On the outside still hear the letter as the letter falls down the fence , flushed down the screen , splashed into the wall . 
Mr. Dursley tried to keep his voice calm as he brushed off the remains of his mustache . 
- Shelf it . 
Everyone is ready for five minutes to leave . 
We will leave here . 
Just wrapping clothes , do not say anything . 
His face was extremely violent with half of his mustache gone , so no one dared to say his words . 
Ten minutes later , they ducked through the closed door to get into the car , drove quickly to the freeway . 
Dudley was crying in the back seat ; Not that his father had touched his head when he slipped away the television , the computer , the video he had tucked into his sports bag . 
They drive . 
And keep driving . 
Even Dursley did not dare to ask where they were going . 
Sometimes he turns the immortal and runs in the opposite direction running for a while . 
Each time he did so he muttered : 
- throw off all 
They do not stop to eat or drink throughout the day . Night down , Dudley roared . 
In life it has never experienced such a tragic day . 
Hungry , just missed the five most popular TV shows , and even today it has not exploded any opponent in the game on his machine . 
Dursley finally stopped by a dimly lit hotel in the outskirts of a big city . 
Dudley and Harry share a room with double beds and damp sheets . 
Dudley soon snored , but Harry was distracted , sitting on the stained - glass window looking down at the traffic lights running down the street . 
The next day they ate corn tortillas , canned tomatoes and toast for breakfast . 
When they finished eating , the hotel owner went to the table and said , 
- Sorry to have a Harry Potter here ? 
I received hundreds of letters like this at the reception desk . 
She raised a letter to let people read the address written in blue ink : 
Harry Potter 
Room 17 
The railway hotel 
Cokeworth 
Harry reached for the letter but Dursley hit his hand . 
The hotel owner's eyes widened . 
Mr. Dursley quickly stood up and followed the hotel mistress : 
- I will take the mail . 
Hours later , Mrs. Dursley closed the rabbit with her husband : 
- Darling , do not you go home ? 
But Mr Dursley did not seem to listen to his wife . 
Exactly what he was looking for was unknown . 
He kept driving in the middle of the forest , then drove out , then ran again . 
As such , they crossed the plowed field , to the middle of the bridge , and up on the top floor of the multi - storey car park . 
That afternoon , Dudley asked his cheek : 
- Three crazy right cheek ? 
Mr. Dursley parked his car near the beach , locked his car inside , and disappeared . 
It started to rain . 
The heavy rain drops down the roof of the car . 
Dudley sniffed . 
He bared his mother : 
- secondly . 
Tonight the Great Humberto shows . 
I want to stop where there is a television . 
Second , Harry remembered . 
It is possible to rely on Dudley for its television programs that know exactly the days of the week . 
If today is Monday , tomorrow - Tuesday , is Harry's eleventh birthday . Harry's birthday is unmatched - last year , Dudley's family gave him a coat hook and a pair of old Dursley stockings . 
Even so , it's not always my eleventh birthday . 
Mr. Dursley came back with a smile on his face . 
He picked up a long package , not responding to his wife he bought something . 
He said : 
- Make a perfect place . 
Let's all come out . 
Outside the car was very cold . 
Mr Dursley showed people a big rocky outcrop . 
Pitching on the rock is one of the most unforgettable tents anyone can imagine . There is certainly no television . 
Mr. Dursley rubbed his hands together excitedly , 
- Forecast storm tonight . 
And he kindly agreed to let us borrow the boat . 
An elderly toothless man was approaching them with a wicked smile . 
He raised his hand to indicate an old canoe floating on the watery gray canvas below . 
Mr. Dursley ordered : 
- Everyone on the boat ! 
I have bought some food . 
In the freezing cold . 
The splash of sea water splashed up on them with synergy of cold rain falling down in the sky , making everyone squat . 
Yet the wind whipped the skin . 
After a few hours of seemingly long hours , the boat seemed to reach the cliff . 
Dursley stumbled across the frog as he slipped past the only dwarf gang on the island . 
The inside of the hut was horrible : it smelled of seaweed , and the wind was screaming through the openings of the wall , the fire was damp and empty . 
The hut is divided into two compartments . 
The food that Mr. Dursley complained was just a bag of chips for each person and a banana . 
The group of firefighters , with their fried potato chips , was empty , but these empty bags just crumpled and smoked . 
Still , Dursley rubbed his hand excitedly : 
- Now do not read the letter again . 
He is in a state of elation . 
Obviously , he absolutely believed that no one would reach this place in a thunderstorm in order to deliver a letter . 
Harry , too , was not happy with that . 
At night , the storm is anticipated to rise violently around them . 
The high - pitched waves rumbled into the walls of the hut and the roaring wind bellowed the shaking windows . 
Mrs Dursley found a blanket in the next room , spreading it on the couch with a gnawing duck to make Dudley's bed sleep . 
She and Dursley slept on the rickety bed in the next room . 
Harry was left alone . 
He found the quietest place on the floor , curled like a dried shrimp under a rag as a blanket . 
The storm became more and more mad at the night . 
Harry could not sleep . 
He pushed back , trying to find a comfortable place to pat the empty stomach emptying the belly . 
Meanwhile Dudley snored as if he was singing with the wind and the thunder in the open air . 
Its arms were lined up beside the bench , the luminous figures on Dudley's wrist watch said that ten minutes later it was midnight and Harry would turn eleven . 
Harry lay down waiting for his birthday to move on , wondering if the Dursleys would remember his birthday , and wondered where the writer was now . 
Five minutes elapsed . 
Harry sounded like there was a sprinkle outside . 
She wished the roof would not collapse , though the roof that collapsed on her should be warmer . 
It's four minutes until Harry's birthday . 
Maybe when they get back , the house at 4 Privet Drive is full of letters , maybe Harry will find a way to get a leaf . 
In three minutes . 
Do not know if the sea is smashing into the rocky cliffs out there ? 
And what is that funny kennel in two minutes ? 
Or is this island being hit by waves breaking into the sea ? 
There will be another minute and Harry will be eleven . 
Thirty seconds or nineteen Or it wakes Dudley , just to tease it . 
Three seconds two one 
BOOM 
Both shakes shakes and Harry sat up , gazing out the door . 
Someone outside was banging on the door . 
Chapter 04 : THE KEYWORD 
Bum ! 
Outside the door again . 
Dudley was awakened . 
He asked , 
- Where are the explosions ? 
Behind them , the door whistled , Mr. Dursley stepped out , hands on the gun - Well , the long package that everyone saw him holding on to the island is this gun . 
He shouted : 
- Who's that ? 
I warn that I have a gun . 
Yen for a while . 
Already 
YEAR . 
The door was punched so hard that it hinged on its hinges , making a deafening sound as it collapsed to the floor . 
On the threshold , a hapless man stood . 
His face was almost bearded and his hair covered in shaggy hair , but behind his bearded hair , glistening black eyes . 
The giant came to the hut , slightly shrugged . 
His hair touched the ceiling , wiping out the spider webs . 
The old man put up the door , tied it to the door frame with ease . 
The thunderstorm roared outside so it settled down a bit . 
Then the stranger turned to look at everyone : 
- There is no tea ? Wow ! The trip was hard . 
He shook the bench , where Dudley was in a corner , afraid of death . 
- Get up , meat stuff ! 
Dudley ran away and hugged her mother , and her mother was shocked to hug her hug behind her husband . 
The giant said , 
- Oh , here it is ! 
Harry looked up at the fierce wild furry face and caught his glittering black eyes sparkling with laughter . 
The giant said , 
- Last time I saw you , I was still a baby . 
You are like father and son , but your eyes are like mother . 
Mr. Dursley said in a hushed voice : 
- I ask you to leave this place immediately . 
He is invading illegal housing ! 
- Hey , listen , Mr. Dursley ! 
The giant leaned over the bench , snatched the gun from Mr. Dursley's hand , twisted it into a clump as if it were made of rubber , and threw it into the corner . 
Mr. Dursley uttered something , sounding odd as the mice snared . 
But the old man turned his back to Dursley , telling Harry , 
- Anyway , congratulations on a happy birthday , Harry . 
There are some gifts for me . 
Maybe we have a little push on the butt , but the taste is still good . 
Picked up from a black jacket pocket to a large suitcase . 
Harry opened the box with trembling fingers . 
Inside is a large , plump chocolate cake with happy birthday written in green cream . 
Harry looked up at the giant . 
He wanted to say thank you , but the word lost on the way from the bottom of the heart to the mouth . 
And instead of two hours of thanks , the question is : 
- Who are you ? 
Giant tongue sure . 
- Oh , I have not introduced myself yet . 
I am Rubeus Hagrid , keeper of the lock and guard at Hogwarts . 
He held out a huge hand , holding Harry's whole arm shaking . 
Then , rubbing his hands together , Hagrid said , 
- Hey , is there tea ? 
I do not refuse cigarettes , if I have some tea . 
Hagrid looked at the potato chips in the fireplace and sniffed . 
He did not know what he was doing , only a second later , when he stood up , the fire burned in the fireplace . 
The fire made the humming booth glow and Harry felt the warmth flowing over it , clutching it as if it were just floating in a hot tub . 
The giant sat down on the couch . 
The chair screams under the weight of the old man . 
From his black jacket pocket , he pulled out all sorts of things , a saucer bag , a stick , a tea pot , baby cups , and a bottle of amber water that he made a sip before making a tea . . 
Just a moment later , all the scallops smelled of sausage . 
While the giant was busy preparing tea , grilled sausages , no one dared to say anything . 
But as he began to unscrew the six rounds of hot and spicy sausages from the rod , Dudley moved a little closer . 
Mr. Dursley hurriedly scolded the child : 
" Dudley , you must not touch anything he gives you . 
The giant smiled : 
" Dursley , please , son of your flesh , need some extra fat . 
He put the sausage to Harry . 
He is hungry , but has never tasted anything so good , but his eyes still stare at the giant . 
Finally , as no one seemed to be able to explain , he said : 
- I'm sorry but I still do not know who you are ? 
The giant took a sip of his tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . 
He said , 
" Call me Hagrid . 
And as I told you , I'm the keeper of Hogwarts . - Of course I ' ll know everything about Hogwarts . 
- I do not know 
Hagrid looked startled . 
Harry hurriedly said : 
- I'm sorry . 
- Sorry ? 
Hagrid snapped back at Dursley , who was cowering in the dark . 
- We have to say sorry ! 
I know you did not receive the letters , but I do not think you know anything about Hogwarts . 
I never wondered whether my parents learned everything from here ? 
- all what ? 
Hagrid was angry , shouting like thunder : 
- ALL WHAT ? okay , you wait for me a bit . 
He stood up , and the rage seemed to overflow the hut . 
Mr. Dursley's family slammed into the wall . 
Hagrid glared at Dursley . 
- He told me this kid - this kid ! - do not know anything about it , right ? 
Harry thought there must be some misunderstanding . 
He had to go to school , and his grades at school were not bad . 
And he said , 
- You know a bit . 
I do math and other regular subjects . 
But Hagrid just said , 
- Know our world . It is my world , my world , my parents ' world . 
- What world ? 
Hagrid seems to be about to explode . 
And the explosion : 
- DURSLEY ! 
Mr. Dursley was already pecking , now stuttering something that sounds like scurrying turn . 
Hagrid glared at Harry . 
He said , 
- You should know about my parents . I mean they are famous . 
You are also famous . 
- Why ? 
Three children , mother not famous what ? 
Hagrid ran his hand through his thick , dense hair , his eyes fixed on the boy's face . 
- I do not know so I do not know , do not know what is the child ? 
Dursley suddenly found his voice . 
He ordered : 
- Stop ! 
Stop here , sir . 
I forbid you to tell the child what to do . 
Hagrid looked at Mr. Dursleys angrily . 
Even more brave than Mr. Dursley many times have to shrink before that look . 
When Hagrid uttered the words , his voice was trembling with rage . 
- So you never talked to him ? 
Did not let him know the contents of the letter that Dumbledore left for him ? 
At that time I have ! 
We clearly left Dumbledore to leave that letter , Mr. Dursley ! 
How many years have you been holding a baby ? 
Harry asked impatiently : 
- What are you hiding ? 
Mr. Dursley shouted , 
- END ! BANNED ! 
Mrs. Dursley gasped for fear . 
Hagrid said coldly , 
- Well , both of you pour your head in boiling water . 
Harry , you're a witch . 
The silence suddenly resides in the hut . 
Just hear the roar and the wind blowing outside . 
Finally , Harry gasped , 
- What are you ? 
- Witch . of course , the witch . 
Hagrid sat down on the couch , he sat a bit too strong , so the couch louder and he sank . 
- And a great witch . 
I dare say , once you are well - trained , you will be a high - powered witch . 
As the family of the great witch as three babies , then you must be a true witch . 
Well , I think it's time to read this letter . 
Harry handed over the letter with the gold envelope , address written in blue jade ink , subject : 
Send Harry Potter 
Floor 
Hut on stone 
Sea 
It draws the letter out : 
HOGWARTS INSTITUTE OF LEGACY AND MECHANICS 
Principal : Albus Dumbledore 
( Great Merlin Order , Great Witch , General Warlock , Supreme Master , International Witch Federation ) 
Dear Harry Potter , 
We are pleased to inform you that you have been admitted to the Hogwarts Academy of Law and Magic . 
Please see the attached list of all books and equipment . 
The course begins on September 1 . 
We waited until 31 July at the latest . 
Sincerely , 
Professor McGonagall 
Vice - president . 
McGonagall 
In Harry's mind , the question was like a fireworks , so he did not know what to ask first . 
Just a few minutes after Harry's eagerness to settle , let him ask a few questions : 
- what do you mean ? 
Hagrid clapped his hands on the forehead . 
- Ah , we almost forgot . 
Gorgons Water - great ! 
From one of the other pockets of the old coat , a pair of owl - owls , furry , wrinkled - and a parchment with goose feather . 
Then he stuck his tongue out and wrote a letter that Harry could read all the letters in reverse as follows : 
Dear Professor Dumbledore 
gave the letter to Harry Potter 
Lead it to measure 
The weather is so sad 
Do not worry 
Hagrid 
Hagrid finished writing the letter , handing it to the door and throwing it in the middle of the storm . 
Hagrid turned back to sit down , as though he had just finished a phone call . 
Harry's mouth opened and closed . 
Hagrid pat his forehead : 
- Where did we stop the story ? 
At that moment Mr Dursley , still as gray as an ash , waited , but the extreme anger had shifted from the dark corner to the spot where the fire was shining . 
He resolutely : 
- The little boy will not go to that school . 
Hagrid growled : 
- Really want to see a Muggle as big as he would prohibit him like ? 
Harry interrupted , 
- What's up ? 
- A Muggle . 
Hagrid explained . 
- that is the name we call people without magic , ie , the mortal . 
Unfortunately , I was raised in the most typical Muggle family that I have ever seen . 
Mr. Dursley said : 
When I received the baby , I vowed to put an end to my evil deeds , and I swore I would take the baby away from him . 
Witchcraft 
Harry exclaimed : 
That means the stepfather knew before ? 
Did you know that you were a witch ? 
Mrs. Dursley sighed . 
- I know ! Of course I know from before . 
How are you like three cheekbones . 
At that time , he received a letter like that , left home in that devil school , and then every summer to relinquish his bag full of tadpoles , turn the tea cup into a mouse ! 
I'm the only one who knows what your eyebrows are - what a shame ! 
Only Lily and Lily are fortunate to have a witch in the house ! buzzing 
Mrs. Dursley paused to speak . 
It seems she has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time to say , 
- Then you meet your father in that school , the school is married , then laid your eyebrows , and of course I know you are the same with your parents , also monstrous , also abnormal . Okay , if you want to know the end , I ' ll tell you always , your three mothers keep doing the three sorcery so it has exploded , so that we have the debt department is you . 
Harry was dumbfounded , dressed up again . 
As it turned out to be the voice , it asked : 
- Explosive ? 
I have it with you that my parents died in a car accident . 
- ACCIDENT ! 
Hagrid roared , angrily jumping , causing the Dursleys to step back into the dark . 
Growled Hagrid . 
- How can a car accident kill the grandparents ? 
That's crazy ! 
A blow - base - not play ! 
Well , here it is : Harry Potter does not know anything about his story , while every kid in the world knows his name ! 
Harry asked urgently : 
- But why ? 
What happened ? 
The anger seems to have gone off on Hagrid's face . 
Suddenly he seemed nervous . 
- I never expected this . 
When Dumbledore says that we will have a lot of difficulties finding his son , that he does not know anything , we still can not think of this . 
Harry , I'm not sure I'm qualified to tell you - then someone will do this - but I can not go to Hogwarts without knowing anything about myself . 
He threw a hateful look at Dursleys . 
- Okay , well , let me tell you what I know . 
But I can not tell you everything , it's a hideous secret , part of the story 
Hagrid paused , sat down , stared at the flames for a few seconds , and said , 
- According to me , the story starts with a guy called - I'm sure I do not know his name , though incredibly hard , anyone in our world knows 
- Who ? 
- Well , I do not want to mention that name . 
No one wants to . 
- Why not ? 
- Because people are still afraid . 
This is hard to explain . Something about an evil witch . 
He became evil and cruel . 
Increasingly wicked evil . 
His name is 
Hagrid was speechless , not a word heard . 
Harry suggested : 
- Or write you . 
- No - I can not spell his name . 
Well , his name is Voldemort . 
Hagrid shivered . 
- Do not tell us to repeat his name again . 
Twenty years ago , this evil witch doctor , began to roam the disciples . 
Also pull a bunch . 
It's scary , someone wants to lean on his power , because he's got a lot of magic . That was a dark time , Harry . 
Do not know who , do not dare to make friends with strangers all the frightening happen . 
He covers . 
Of course there are people against him . 
But he was killed . 
Aghast . 
The only safe place is Hogwarts . 
You must know Dumbledore is the one who - whom - who - also - know - is - who - is also abstinent . 
He did not dare go to Hogwarts , at least at that time . 
Now I talk about my parents . 
They are good wizards that we have known . 
The top three of the boys and the mother and daughter were the girls . The secret is why who - who - knows - who - knows - who - is not blindly mother to three . 
I suppose because my parents are very close and close to Dumbledore , they have nothing to do with the dark side . 
Maybe who - who - knows - knows - who - wants to threaten , maybe he wants to get rid of obstacles on his way . 
No one knows exactly , only he finally came to my village on the night of Ma Society ten years ago . 
At that time I still have a crib . 
He came to my house and 
Hagrid suddenly pulled a dirty wrinkled handkerchief to blow his nose to hear a big one . 
He said , 
- Sorry . 
It's tragic . 
I know your three children , good - natured people , whom you never find again 
He sniffed and continued , 
- Who - well - know - who - they killed them and - this is the secret of this story - he tried to kill me . 
He wants to pluck the grass to the root , or not through him is inspirational killing , I do not know , but he tried to kill the child was not . 
You do not know the lightning bolt on your forehead ? That's not a normal scars . It is the traces of who - who - know - who - are - left when all of his powers and mantras are null and void . 
He killed all three babies , but he did not kill me . 
That's why I'm famous Harry . 
No one has been convicted of him without dying , except for his son . 
The best witches of the era , such as McKinnon , Bones , Prewetts , died in his hands . 
But you , a baby boy , still live . 
Harry remembered something painful in his memory . 
The older Hagrid saw , the darker the glimmer of blue , the more clearly he remembered - and for the first time in his life , Harry remembered something else : it was a vicious , cold laugh . 
Hagrid looked sadly at Harry . 
" I have obeyed Dumbledore to take him out of the destroyed house , bring him to the Muggles 
Mr. Dursley wrote : 
- babble 
Harry jumped up and jumped . 
It almost forgot the Dursleys were still in the hut . 
Mr. Dursley must have regained his courage , he was staring at Harry and his hands clenched . 
He said : 
- Now listen , boy . 
I accept that there are strange stories about you , but perhaps wind blows only . 
All the things about the three brows , the demonic , the evil , follow me , the world without them is only better . 
Ambiguous with evil demons , then it ends just as I said 
At that moment , Hagrid jumped out of the bench , pulling out an umbrella inside his jacket . 
Hagrid pointed his nose at Mr Dursley as if it were a sword . 
He said , 
- I warned Mr. Dursley - I warned him , only one more say is 
In the face of the danger of being knocked down by an umbrella , Dursley dashed his courage . 
He sticked himself in the wall . 
- Is that better ? 
Hagrid gulped , breathing heavily , letting himself sit on the couch . 
This time , the chair completely covered her tea . 
Harry , at the time , still had a hundred questions , jokingly raised one of the most important questions : 
- But Vol , forgotten , who - whom - who - also - know - is - who - what , what happened to him ? 
- Good question Harry . 
Disappear . 
Dissipate . On the night that he killed her , he turned away . This makes the child more famous . 
He's gone - that's the biggest secret . 
Do you understand ? 
At that time he was growing stronger . 
Anything he must leave . 
- Some people think he is dead . 
I suppose he was burnt into the ghost . 
Who knew he had enough people to die or not ? 
Some people think he is still somewhere , rehearsing for the time . 
But I do not believe . 
The one who has been on his side has fallen on his side , some have awakened the anger , he has turned back , they do not even follow him . 
- Most of us think he is still somewhere , but maybe have lost his power . 
He had all the tears . 
It was your miracle that ended his life , Harry . 
Something happened that night that he could not cope . 
I do not know what . 
No one knows . 
But the thing that destroys the one - who - knows - who - knows - is - related to you . 
Hagrid looked at Harry with warm and respectful eyes , but Harry , rather than feeling glad or proud , stabbed in doubt about this . 
Witch ? 
It ? 
How can that be ? 
He had lived in the Dursley family for so long , being ridiculed by Dudley , exiled by the Dursleys ; Candles that have miracles are why they have not been turned into frogs every time they locked Harry in the room under the stairs . 
If it ever made the most wicked sorcerer in the world , how could Dudley be kicking him on the field ? 
Harry calmly said : 
- Uncle Hagrid , I'm sure you were wrong , I do not believe you can be a witch . 
Hagrid surprised , 
- Not a witch ? 
Have you never done any miracles when you were angry or scared ? 
Harry stared at the fire . 
Now it begins to think about this . The trouble that happened to her aunt's outbreak of scabbings occurs when he is angry or too afraid . 
When Dudley's band was chasing too close , suddenly he found himself distracted . When he was too scared to go to school with a funny bald head , his hair suddenly grew long in the night And the last time Dudley hit the beat It is gradually for a tentacle without any sense of how you acted . 
And the snake Boa constrictor , perhaps due to the release itself ? 
Harry looked back at Hagrid , smiling and getting a glimpse of joy in his eyes . 
- See ? 
Harry Potter , let me see , I'm not just a witch , I ' ll be famous at Hogwarts . 
Mr. Dursley did not accept defeat without fighting until the last minute . 
He hissed : 
- I said it would not go to that school . 
He will go to Stone Wall School , so it's nice . 
I have read the letters and all the nonsense that I need to follow that school of magic , the mantra , the wand , and 
Growled Hagrid : 
" If Hagrid wants to , a big Muggle like him can not stop it . 
Do not let Potter's son go to school at Hogwarts ! 
Is not that crazy ? 
New born is enrolled in that school then . 
He would go to the best magical and magical school in the world . 
After seven years there , it will be a person no one can imagine right now . There she would study with her children of the same type and would be cared for by the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had , Albus Dumbledore 
Mr. Dursley cried out : 
- I WILL NOT PAY FOR WOMEN LOVE YOU LIKE THEM ! 
Hagrid thundered and threw an umbrella over Dursleys head . 
- NEVER FORGET ALBUS SUMBLEDORE BEFORE IT ! 
He picked up an umbrella from the air , pointing his nose at Dudley . 
A bright purple light flashed , and at the same time a sound like a crescendo sounded . 
And just a second later , Dudley jumped in place , arms clutching fat , screaming in pain . 
As Dudley crossed his back , Harry saw a curly pigtail tucked out of Dudley's pants . 
Mr. Dursley went up , dragged his wife and son to the next room , cast a disgusted look at Hagrid , and slammed the door shut . 
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella , stroking his whiskered beard . 
- We should not be angry . 
Anyhow , magic does not work . I mean to turn that guy into a pig , but I see that it is no different from pigs so there is no room for our spells to work . 
His eyes widened in horror at Harry . 
He cleared his throat as if discussing something important : 
- Do not tell anyone in Hogwarts about this , thank you very much . 
I'm not allowed to use magic , seriously . 
I was only a little bit when looking for children to give mail and prepare for you . 
So I enjoy doing this task very much . 
Harry asked : 
- Why are not you allowed to do magic ? 
- Ờ I was a student at Hogwarts , but I did not play , but I told you I was expelled , third year . 
They broke my spike . But Dumbledore saved me as a keeper . 
Dumbledore was a great man . 
- Why did you get fired ? 
- Late at night . 
Mai also have many things to do , take the children to go to the streets to buy school uniforms and everything else . 
He took off his thick black coat for Harry : 
- You go to sleep . 
It's a bit rusty , but it's okay . 
I guess in the pocket still have two mice . 
Chapter 05 : HAPPINESS 
The next morning Harry woke up early . 
Even though it was morning , it still closed its eyes . 
She said to herself , 
- Just a dream . 
I dream of a giant named Hagrid came to tell me to prepare to go to school in magic . 
Open your eyes , I will be in the room under the stairs again . 
Suddenly there was a loud knock . 
Harry thought : Come on , Aunt Petunia was calling the door to wake up . 
His heart tightened . 
But he did not open his eyes . 
How beautiful the dream last night . 
Cut off . 
Cut off . Cut off 
Harry muttered : 
- Yes . 
Get up 
Harry sat up , Hagrid's black coat away from him . 
The hut was filled with sunlight , and the storm was over , and Hagrid lay on the couch and snorted , and out , an owl was knocking at the window , . 
Harry jumped up , enjoying himself as if he had a big bubble bulging in his body . 
It ran to open the window . 
The owl flew right in , dropping the newspaper on Hagrid's head , but he was still asleep . 
The owl leaped around the room , cutting Hagrid's coat . 
Harry tries to chase away the owl : 
- do not do that ! 
But Harry had an ankle in his anger , and then continued to abuse the coat . 
Harry called out : 
- Hagrid has an owl 
Hagrid groaned in sleep : 
- Boa it ! 
- Yes ? 
- It wants to be paid for broadcasting . 
Get in your pocket . 
Harry's bag , Hagrid's coat seemed to be made entirely of pouches , in which countless things : key chains , coils , mints , bagels , a strange silver grip . 
Hagrid's sleepy voice : 
- Boa it five knuts . 
- What is knuts ? 
- They are small coins . 
Harry counts five Knuts , the owl raised his leg so that Harry could put the coins in a small pocket on his leg . 
Then it flew out the window . 
Hagrid yawned loudly , sitting up , stretching . 
- let's go , Harry , there's a lot to do today . 
I have to take my children to London to prepare for the day of school . 
Harry still flips over to look at some witch coins . 
He was thinking of something like a bubble that made him rise when he got up . 
The bubble seems to be deflating . 
It hesitated : 
- Uncle Hagrid 
- Huh ? 
Hagrid was wearing a pair of big boots . 
Harry confused : 
- I have no money , no money . 
I heard his stepfather said then , he did not pay tuition fees for the school to magic . 
Hagrid stood up and scratched his head . 
- do not worry about that . 
Did not my three mothers leave nothing to me ? 
- But if the house was destroyed 
- Your cheeks do not store gold in the house . To see , we first visit Gringotts , witch bank . 
Eat a piece of sausage , too , not to cold . 
And if you invite me a piece of your birthday cake , I'm not afraid . 
- Witches also have banks ? 
- There's one - Gringotts . 
The goblins run . 
Harry dropped the sausage he was holding , opened his mouth : 
- I love you ? 
- Ừ . 
So only the crazy dare to count the robbery of this bank . 
Harry , you never have to mess with the goblins . 
In addition to Hogwarts , Gringotts is the safest place in the world to deposit money for wealth . 
There is also a story to visit Gringotts . 
On Dumbledore's orders . 
That's the story of Hogwarts . 
Hagrid said , puffing his chest proudly . 
- Dumbledore often assigns us important tasks , such as picking up children , or going to the bank . 
I see that my credibility is very . 
Finished yet ? 
Well , come on . 
Harry followed Hagrid out of the hut , standing on the cliff . 
The sky is now clear , the sea sparkling with the sunshine . 
Dursley's renting boat was still battered on the waves after the storm . 
Harry looked around looking for another boat . 
She asked : 
- How did you get here ? 
Hagrid answered calmly , 
- Fly . 
- Flying ? 
- Ừ . 
But now we are going to be in the boat . 
I am not allowed to spend magic with you . 
Two men down the boat , but Harry still stare at Hagrid , trying to imagine how this giant man flies out ? 
Hagrid dodged Harry's look , saying : 
- I have to paddle my hand is really bad . 
If I make the boat run fast , do not say anything to Hogwarts ! 
Harry said , impatiently to see magic : 
- No , no . 
Hagrid pulled out his umbrella , slamming it twice in the canoe , leaving one , leaving the island , heading for the land . 
Harry asked again : 
- Why is the plot of the Gringotts bank robbery so crazy ? 
Elder Hagrid opened the witch magazine and said , 
- It is said that the bank has the dragon guard the treasury . 
It's not easy to get out . 
The Gringotts lie a few hundred miles below the bottom of London , do not you understand ? 
Deep in the underworld . 
Even if there is a hole in the treasury then there is no way to get to the ground , or starve to death before getting up . 
Harry thought about this while Hagrid reported , the prologue . 
With experience at Mr. Dursley's house , Harry knew that when people read newspapers , do not be foolishly disturbed . 
But with hundreds of questions why ? , what ? just waving in his head , Hary miserable to try to sit still . 
Hagrid flipped through the pages , 
- The secretary of the secretaries made everything up ! 
Harry did not stop himself , jokingly asked : 
- Do you have a ministry secretary ? 
Said Hagrid . 
- Of course yes . 
They also wanted Dumbledore to be the minister again , but he refused to leave Hogwarts , so Cornelius was the manager . 
He is a professional messenger . 
Every morning Dumbledore disturbed Dumbledore by mistake to ask for advice . 
- But what does the secretary do ? 
- Well , the main job is to make the Muggles do not know the witch is still spotless . 
- so what ? 
- to pay ? 
Harry , everybody wants to make their lives theirs . 
It is best that we stay calm . 
This boat sank lightly onto the harbor embankment . 
Hagrid folded up the newspaper and walked two stone steps to the road . 
Everyone glared at Hagrid on the way to the tram station in this tiny town . 
Harry could not blame them . 
Hagrid was not only about twice as likely to be a normal person , but also pointing out things that were completely normal on the street , like a parking meter , saying , 
- See that , Harry ? 
All the nonsense of the Muggles thought ! 
To keep up with the giant Hagrid , Harry had to run and run , so his voice was panting : 
- Uncle Hagrid , you said that there are dragons in Gringotts ? 
- heard that . 
To say there is demon ghost , I enjoy the dragon . 
- Do you like dragons ? 
- Since childhood I wanted a dragon . 
Come here 
They came to the station . 
The train from here to London was about to run for about five minutes . 
Hagrid did not know how to use Muggle money , so he used paper money for Harry to buy tickets . 
On the train , Hagrid was looking at him more evilly : He occupied two seats and sat there knitting something that looked like a bright red circus tent . 
Counting the nose knitting asked : 
- Keep your letter not Harry ? 
Harry pulled the parchment out of the envelope . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Good . 
There is a list of things that you need in it . 
Harry opened the second paper attached to that yesterday evening it not even notice .

Harry could not help but cry out : 
Can all these be bought in London ? 
Said Hagrid . 
- If you know where to sell . 
Up until now , Harry had never been to London . 
And Hagrid , though apparently aware of where he was going , was clearly unfamiliar with the way to get there by means of ordinary traffic in the mortal world . 
He was trapped in a subway ticket control machine , grumbling over the small chair , which was slow . 
Just climbed the broken ladder to reach the road full of vehicles shop , he said : 
- Do not understand how the Muggles do not have the magic that can handle it ? 
He was so big that he could roam the crowd to get on easily , and Harry just slammed on the heel . 
They walked past bookstores and music parlors , restaurants and theaters , but none of them seemed to have the wand to sell to Harry . It's just a normal street full of ordinary people . 
Could it lie below the thousands of yards is the gold pile of witches ? 
Can there be true mantras and broomsticks ? 
Or does all that sorcery are just another cruel joke of the Dursleys ? 
But the Dursleys were never joking , Harry was sure . 
So Harry could not help but think of Hagrid , though what he said had no place to believe . 
Hagrid suddenly stopped saying : 
- here it is . 
Leaky Cauldron . 
A famous place . 
It was a smelly little pub . 
If Hagrid was not the only one , Harry did not realize that he was lying there . People were passing by without glancing at him . 
Their eyes slipped from one large bookstore to the other as if they had not seen the Leaky Cauldron . 
Honestly , Harry had a dull feeling that it was only him and Hagrid could see the pub . 
But it was not until he commented that Hagrid had pushed the door in the store . 
What a famous place that is both dark and sticky . 
A few old men sat in the corner , sipping a few glasses of wine , one of whom smoked a long pipe . 
A small man with a high hat was talking to the liquor merchant at the counter . 
This wine solder has a scaly head that looks like a chubby chestnut . 
The whispered whispers whirled around as Hagrid and Harry entered . 
People seem to know Hagrid ; they waved and smiled at the old man , the wine vendor picked up a glass and asked him : 
- As always , Hagrid ? 
But Hagrid refused : 
- No , Tom . 
I am working for Hogwarts . 
He patted Harry's shoulder on Harry's shoulder , making him almost fall apart . 
The wine salesman looked at Harry suspiciously : 
- Devil , this is how it is 
Leaky Cauldron suddenly became silent and quiet . 
The wholesaler whispered : 
- Three souls for me . this is Harry Potter . 
Pleased to tell me how ! 
He rushed over to the bar , fumbling for Harry's shaking hand , tears streaming down his face . 
- Congratulations on your return , Potter , welcome to you . 
Harry did not know what to say . 
Everybody is looking at it . 
The old man with his pussy was puzzled , not realizing that the pipe was off . 
Hagrid was hatching his face . 
Then they screamed and screamed , pulling the chair back to where it was , everyone at Leaky Cauldron shook Harry's hand . 
- Good morning , Potter . I'm Doris Crockfort . 
I can not believe I finally met you . 
" It is a pleasure , Potter , I am so pleased . 
- Always wanted to shake hands , I fully admire him . 
" I'm so glad Potter , I'm so glad to say I'm Diggle , Dedalus Diggle . 
Harry said : 
- I have seen you before . 
Once I greet you in the supermarket . 
Diggle's high - tech hat narrowly dropped out of pride . 
He looked around and shouted loudly : 
- He recognized me , you hear , he miss me ! 
Harry had to shake hands , Doris Crockfort turned around and shook his hand . 
A pudgy man approached Harry , who looked like he was in extreme tension , one of his eyes twitching . 
Hagrid greeted him and introduced : 
- Hello Professor Quirrell . 
Harry , Professor Quirrell will be one of the teachers at Hogwarts . 
Professor Quirrell said : 
- PP P Potter , ttta can not express how happy to see the child again . 
- Quirrell , what magic teacher ? 
- Anti - blackboard technician . 
Professor Quirrell muttered as if the subject was not worth thinking to him . 
Then he laughed excitedly : 
- I do not need to , do not you need to go to the subject , P P Potter ? 
I'm sure you've got everything ready for admission . 
We have just found a new book about the dragon . 
The professor seems to have a great deal of imagination with that idea . 
But the others refused to let Professor Quirrell spend Harry Potter . 
It took Hagrid a dozen minutes to remove Harry from the crowd around him . 
He was a lousy man with a loud voice that was jamming around . 
- Let's go , there's more to buy . 
Harry , let's go . 
Doris Crockfort shook Harry's hand the last time , and Hagrid led her over the counter to a walled courtyard . There was nothing but a trash can and weeds . 
Hagrid grinned at Harry : 
- I told you , right ? 
I was very famous child . 
Even Professor Quirrell was touched when he met her . 
By the way , let me tell you , the professors are trembling . 
- Are you always so tense ? 
- do not 
Poor him . 
An extraordinary wisdom . 
He studied the books , the life is good , but it is okay to take a year off the field . Heard that he met the dragon - the dragon in Heilong , again more foolish with a rub . 
Since then , he never regained his former style . 
Since then he stabbed fear , afraid of his students , afraid of his subjects . 
Um , where's my umbrella ? 
Harry's head was spinning . 
Vampire ? 
Stomach - rub ? 
Hagrid was busy counting brick walls behind the trash . 
He murmured : 
- Three horizontal lines on the right . 
Get back , Harry . 
He tapped the wall three times . 
The bricks that touched them seemed to shudder - they shrank - and in the middle appeared a small hole . 
The hole grew slowly , and behind them was a gate so large that the giant like Hagrid could walk by . 
This gate opens a crooked cribbed road . 
Hagrid grinned at Harry : 
- Welcome to Alley . 
Harry was surprised , stepped through the gate , and looked over his shoulders , seeing the gate disappearing into a small hole , and the whole wall , solid , solid . 
The sun shines brightly on the heap of vapors outside the nearest store . 
Cauldrons - all sizes - of bronze , of bronze , of tin , of silver . 
A brand hanging above the cauldron said : Stir well - Stackable . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Well , you will need one , but let's go first . 
Harry wished he had eight more eyes . 
As Hagrid stepped onto the street , he turned his head to the island , looking across the four directions , looking at everything : the shop , the furnishings , the people were busy shopping . 
When the two of us passed by the Apothecary shop , a fat lady stood outside the shop and shook her head . 
- Gan dragon what the seventies Sickles a pound , yes that crazy 
There is a whistle sound coming from a dim shop bearing the name of Eeylop - Tawny , Screech , Barn , Brown , and Snowy . 
Many children of Harry's age were nostrils in the windows to admire the broomsticks . 
Harry heard one of the kids say , 
- Look ! 
New Rolling Mill Nimbus 2000 - fastest ever 
The other shops , the one that sells the robes , the telescope and the silver equipment that Harry has never seen in his life . 
Many of the salons are filled with small buckets of spleen and eel eyes . 
And mountains of books of mantras , large cattle , large rolls of parchment , and bottles of potions , potions 
Finally the two of us went to a snow - white building , high above the low - key shops . 
Said Hagrid , 
- Gringotts . 
Standing next to the copper - framed door , in purple and gold uniforms , was 
- That's a goblin . 
Hagrid whispered to Harry as they walked up the white steps towards him . 
Harry is shorter than the head . 
But he had a mischievous face , a spiky , and Harry noticed his legs and fingers were long . 
He greeted when the two of us passed by . 
Now they faced two other doors , of silver , with these inscriptions on the door : 
Strange guests , please come in , but pay attention : 
Any greed . 
Those who enjoy without donation , 
The loan is paid several times over . 
So if you find out . 
On the floor , not the store . 
Then the soldiers steal , watch out . 
Su enough not to be buried . 
Hagrid repeated : 
- As I said before , only to fool around trying to rob Gringotts . 
The two elves greeted the two of them when they passed through the silver door . Behind a long countdown , hundreds of goblins are sitting on high chairs , hobbling on notebooks , attentively scraping the balance with copper scales , carefully examining gems through the eyes . glasses . 
There are countless doors leading to the corridors , and many bustling goblins direct guests to these outlets . 
Hagrid and Harry went to the counter . 
He said to a free goblin : 
- Good morning . 
We came to draw some money in Mr. Potter's closet . 
- Do you have the key ? 
- Yes , sure it is not here . 
Hagrid began to flip through the pockets of his coat , splashing all of the dog into the goblin's notebook . 
He wrinkled his nose . 
Harry looked at the goblin on his right , weighing a pile of rubies like a coal dumplings . 
Hagrid finally shouted : 
- Earn it here . 
He handed a small gold key to the goblin . 
He took a deep look and said , 
- This looks right . 
Hagrid said , 
- And I have a letter from Professor Albus Dumbledore . 
It relates to what - who - well - know - what - is - in the silver cell seven hundred and thirteen . 
The goblin read the letter very carefully . 
Finished , he handed the letter to Hagrid saying : 
- Very good . 
I will let the person take you down both silver . 
Griphook . 
Griphook is another name . 
He waited for Hagrid to collect the dog food in his bag , then took him and Harry to one of the doors that opened the corridor . 
Harry asked : 
- What - who - know - what - is in the silver cellar seven hundred and thirteen is what ? 
Hagrid made a secret : 
- I can not tell you . 
Incredibly secret . 
The work of Hogwarts . 
Dumbledore trusted me . 
Tell me that I lose my job as a playboy . 
Griphook opened the door for them . 
This time Harry was astonished , as he thought of the marble walls of danger now , but saw only a narrow passage of stone lit by the torches . 
The road is quite steep and leads down to a floor with tiny tramlines . 
Griphook blew the whistle , a small self - propelled waggon , and flew on the track to them . 
They climbed up - Hagrid rotated hard - then the car away . 
Initially , the wagon ran in corridors . 
Harry tried to remember , left , right , right , left , middle , right , left , left , right But it could not remember . 
The wagon - the kits themselves know its route , because Griphook does not control anything . 
Not when it was cold , the cold air tightened Harry's eyes , but he did not close his eyes . 
Once upon a time , he thought he saw a flaming fire at the end of the road , when the train ran through it and realized that it was a dragon , but could not watch it closely . on the ground , where huge rock and stone stalks are coming down from the ceiling and rising from the floor . 
Trying to speak louder than the rumbling of the wagon , Harry asked Hagrid : 
- What is the difference between rock and stone stalks , Hagrid ? 
- The term is longer than the letter . 
But do not ask me now . 
I feel drunk . 
The old man was pale , actually he was green . 
Finally when the carriage stopped beside a small door on the wall of the tunnel , Hagrid climbed down and stood leaning against the wall so that his legs would not tremble . 
Griphook unlocked the door . 
The smoke blurted out , and when the smoke cleared , Harry gasped . 
Inside , there are gold ducks , silver bars , and a small heap of money . 
Hagrid smiled : 
- Of all that . 
All of Harry's ? 
Unbelievable . 
The Dursleys would not have known about this treasure , but if they knew , what life was left to Harry ? 
How many times the Dursleys lamented how much they cost to feed her aunt . 
Yet there is a treasure of its own that lies below London . 
Hagrid helped Harry grasp a handful of gold and silver in a bag . 
He explained : 
The gold coin is called Galleons , each gold earns seventeen silver Sickle , and each Sickle eats twenty - nine copper knuts . 
Finished , this is enough for two semesters , the rest is kept safe for the child . 
I turned to him and told Griphook : 
- Now take us to the silver cell seven hundred and thirteen , and slow down a bit for me thanks . 
Griphook says : 
- Only one speed . 
They go deeper and more and more . 
The air is chillingly cold as they cross narrow lanes . 
Swinging the carriage through an underground tunnel , Harry leaned over the wall to see what was deep and dark at the bottom , but Hagrid grabbed his collar and pulled it down and struck one . tearing . 
Satin silver thirteen with no locks . 
Griphook at this time also proved important he said : 
- Back . 
Then he tapped gently on the door with a long finger , and the door just melted . 
Griphook explained : 
" If someone else Gringotts spank on the door , he would be sucked through the door and stuck there permanently . 
Harry wondered : 
- How often do you check the items once ? 
About ten years . 
Griphook replies with a freak smile . 
This extremely safe silver cellar must have been something extremely extraordinary . 
Harry was so sure , so he was eagerly looking at the viewer , thought to see at least the sea of ​​ jewels . 
But at first it did not see anything . 
The room was almost empty . 
Then he noticed a small packet of dust in a brown paper lying on the floor . 
Hagrid immediately picked it up and tucked it into the jacket . 
Harry craved for that , but did not know what to do . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Come on , come back to this car , and do not talk to me on the way back , we are from the mouth of the mouth is high . 
After the train swayed back to the ground , the two of them stood blinking in the bright sunlight in front of the Gringotts Building . 
With a bag full of money , Harry did not know where to go and what to do first . 
It does not need to ask the exchange rate - how much a pound is eaten by a Galleon - knows that it has more money than ever in its life . 
More than the money Dudley had . 
Hagrid nodded toward the Lady Malkin Dress Shop . 
- Buy the uniform first . 
Harry thought of Hagrid leading himself into the shop , but he said , 
- Harry , are you upset if we stop at Leaky Cauldron for a glass ? 
The Gringotts are too overpowering . 
He seemed to be a little car sick , so Harry went to the wife of Lady Malkin alone , very anxious heart . 
Lady Malkin is a dwarf sorceress , grinning and dressed in mauve . 
Harry opened his mouth and said , 
- Hogwarts uniforms dear ? Here are many , spoiled for choice . 
There was a young gentleman in the room trying on it . 
Behind the shop , a boy with a pudgy face standing on a platform for another witch turns his black shirt . 
Lady Malkin placed Harry on another platform beside him , covering a long coat over his head , beginning to mark the length to trim . 
The little boy said : 
- Hello . 
Also Hogwarts ? 
Harry replied , 
- Ừ . 
- My dad was buying books for me at the next store and my cheek was up the street to buy a wand . 
This boy's voice had a boring plastic tone . 
It says a lot : 
- Later , I pulled my cheeks to see the broom . 
It is not clear why people do not allow first - year students to have a brush . 
I'm counting with my three cheeks to buy me a tree and then I ' ll sneak up to school . 
Harry thought about Dudley . 
The boy continues to boast : 
- Hey , have you ever had your own broom ? 
- Not yet . 
- Know Quidditch ? 
- Are not . 
Harry wondered what Quidditch was . 
The boy is wicked : 
- I'm good . 
My mother told me not to go to the house for my husband 
is a sin . 
And I have to say , I agree . 
Do you know where to stay ? 
- Not yet . 
Harry replied , feeling himself more and more stupid . 
The other guy nodded . 
- Actually no one really knows until the official enrollment . 
But I know I ' ll be home to Slytherin , everyone in my family is there . 
Try to think that I was thrown into the Hufflepuff home , I'm sure I stay too . 
Right ? 
Harry did not know what to say , rather than making a murmur in his throat , wishing it had something interesting to say . 
The boy suddenly cried out : 
- Hey look old man . 
He nodded toward the window . 
Hagrid was standing there . 
He grinned at Harry and only two large cream ice creams made him unable to enter . 
Harry was glad he knew a thing he did not know . 
- it's Uncle Hagrid working at Hogwarts . 
He said : 
- Ah , I heard about him . 
That kind of servant , is not it ? 
Harry felt more and less fond of him . 
- He is the lock keeper . 
- exactly . 
I heard he was very rude - Living in a hut in the playground , occasionally drunk , and still do magic , but eventually burned his bed . 
Harry said coldly : 
- I see him well . 
The boy snorted : 
- You think so ? 
Why are you stuck with him ? 
Where are you ? 
- They are dead . 
Harry did not want to continue on the subject with this boy anymore . 
That guy pity : 
- Poor . 
But the three of you are also ours , right ? 
- You mean my parents are witches ? 
" You know there's no one else in Hogwarts , right ? " 
They are not like us , not raised in our way . 
Did not know anything about Hogwarts when they received the call for admission , can not imagine ? 
I think people should maintain the old witch's family tradition . 
Well , what kind of family do you have ? 
Harry did not open his mouth , Lady Malkin said again before : 
- You're done , baby . 
Harry did not regret the conversation that was over his bone , jumping off the platform . 
The other said , 
- So we ' ll meet again at Hogwarts , right ? 
Harry seemed to be quiet when he ate the ice cream that Hagrid bought for him ( strawberry ice cream and peanut butter ) . 
Hagrid asked : 
- What's up ? 
Harry lied : 
- no problem . 
They stop buying parchment and writing feathers . 
Harry got up a bit when he found the ink bottle changing color as he wrote it . 
Out of the shop Harry asked : 
- What is Hagrid , Quidditch ? 
" The party spirit , I forget that this little boy does not know anything about Quidditch ! 
- Do not make me discouraged . 
Harry told Hagrid how he had seen the little boy in the Malkin clothing store . 
- It says that Muggle - born people are not included in Hogwarts . 
- But I'm not from the Muggle family . 
If that kid knew who you were - it definitely meant to know your name if your parents were really witches . 
You see , everyone in Leaky Cauldron shows how they meet when they meet . 
Anyway , he knows what the monkey said . 
Of the best sorcerers we know , there are some who come from the Muggle world , but they have the natural miracle , as the cheeks are an example . 
I think , cheeks have a mediocre sister ! 
- Then what is Quidditch ? 
- It's our sport . 
Witchcraft . 
It's like football in Muggle - based sports - people chase after Quidditch , play in the air , play on broomsticks that play , and have four balls - Well , it's hard to explain the rules . 
What about Slytherin and Hufflepuff ? 
- Dormitory , the home in the school for students accommodation . 
There are four dormitories all . 
It is said that Hufflepuff contains all kinds of illiteracy , but 
Harry was sad : 
- I'm sure you will be in Hufflepuff . 
- Hufflepuff is better than Slytherin . 
Any time now have the name of evil witches not in the fireplace Slytherin ? 
An example is who - who - knows - knows - who - knows - who . 
- Vol , forget , who - who - well - know - who - who also studied at Hogwarts ? 
- It's been a long time . 
Hagrid bought the book for Harry in a bookstore called Letters - and - Harm . There are large books like high - quality leather - covered boulders that touch the ceiling . 
There is a silk - stamped booklet . 
There is a book filled with bizarre signs ; There are no words inside . Like Dudley , a little boy who never reads , he would have preferred to touch the strange books . 
Hagrid must pull Harry out of books like Cursed and Condemned ( Save the friends and punish the enemy . 
with the latest vengeance : hair loss , foot , cauliflower , and many more ) by Professor Vindictus Viridian . 
Harry nostalgically : 
- I want to punish Dudley . 
Hagrid nodded . 
- I do not say that is not good . 
But do not open magic in the Muggle world , except in very special circumstances . 
Besides , I also can not do the curse , you have to learn much to curse the level of others . 
Hagrid also did not allow Harry to buy a cauldron of gold ( on the list of a tin cauldron ) , but he allowed him to buy a beautiful scales to weigh the ingredients of his processing , and buy one . a compact bronze telescope . 
Then they went to the Apothecary , a great place to make any horrible smell , like the smell of eggs mixed with the smell of cabbage . 
Containers of raw materials filled the floor ; Herbal Drinks , Dried Roots , and Light Fabrics to Stay Off the Wall . 
The bundles of leather , the torches of fire , the claws shriveled from the ceiling . 
While Hagrid asked the person behind the counter for some of the ingredients needed for Harry's study , Harry himself went to look at the silver horn ( twenty - one Galleons ) , and the eyes Orange beetle branch , small cup ( five knuts a general ) . 
Out of the Apothecary , Hagrid checked Harry's list of necessities . 
- Only wand is not purchased . 
Ah , yes , I have not given you a birthday present yet . 
Harry felt his cheeks burning . 
- You do not have to 
- I know I do not have to do that . 
But what will I give you ? 
Certainly not to have , then the toads have been long gone , they will laugh at my children . 
I also do not like cats , they make my nose sneeze . 
So I ' ll get you an owl . 
This type is extremely useful , can transfer letters and everything for children . 
Twenty minutes later , the two of them left the Eeylops , a place full of whispers , hot whispers , gleaming eyes . 
Harry had a large cage in his hand , a very white snow - owl inside , burying his head in his sleep . 
Harry could not help repeating his gratitude to Hagrid , who sounded nearly as stubborn as Professor Quirrell . 
Hagrid rudely ruffles : 
- What a meaning ! 
I'm sure you do have a lot of gifts when you're at the Dursleys . 
Now we just need to go to a salon , the only salon that sells the wand , the Ollivanders to find the best wand . 
A wand was what Harry was most eager to have . 
This last one was tiny , just narrow and dirty , on the shop with golden words : Ollivanders , the manufacturer of the chopsticks since 382 . 
Inside the dusty window , there was a single chopstick on a purple pillow . 
When the two of us walked in the store , there was a ringing sound from the sound of the bells ringing down the floor . 
This place is cramped , but empty , except for a single swing for Harry to sit down . 
He felt strange as if he had just entered a very strict library . 
He had to swallow a lot of questions just popping out of his mouth , his eyes staring at the thousands of tiny , long , boxed boxes up to the ceiling . 
Not knowing why Harry suddenly felt like his neck was pricked . 
The dull and silent appearance here seems to cause a sense of creeping in one's bones with a mysterious sorcery . 
Suddenly a gentle voice resounded : 
- Hello . 
Harry stood up . 
Hagrid must have hoped for the thrust of his chair . 
An old man standing in front of his two grandchildren , big eyes and bright as the moonlight illuminated the shop . 
Harry said awkwardly : 
- I say hello . 
The old man said : 
- Ah yes , yes , yes . 
I thought I would see you soon . 
Harry Potter . 
I have my mother's eyes . 
I thought it was just yesterday when I met my mother in the store , bought my first wand . to see , the wooden worm wooden wooden , three inches long , elegant . 
A good chopstick is suitable for training charms . 
Ollivanders approached Harry . 
Harry just wanted the blink of an eye . The moonlit silver eyes make it crown . 
Your father , on the other hand , likes a wooden star wand . 
Three - foot long . 
Flexible . 
More power and excellence in the ability to transform . 
Oh , I see your dad is worth the wand . 
Actually , the wand itself chose the witch , not the witch's choice of wand , that's right . 
Ollivanders approached Harry so much that Harry's nose and nose almost collided . 
Harry could see his reflection in his eyes . 
- And this is the place 
Mr. Ollivanders put his long white finger against the lightning scar on Harry's forehead . 
He said softly : 
- I regret that I sold the wand to the culprit of this scar . 
Four . 
Well , this wand is very , very , very powerful ; Very powerful , but in the hands of a wicked A , as if I know that wand was born to do things 
He shook his head , and then , for Harry , he turned to Hagrid . 
- Hi Rubeus Hagrid . 
It was good to see your chopsticks made of oak , five inches long , slightly curved , right ? 
- yes , sir . 
- That wand is good . 
But did they break your wand when you got chased ? 
Ollivanders's voice suddenly stopped . 
Stumbled Hagrid : 
- Yeah , they did . 
But I still keep breaking . 
Ollivanders remained cold : 
- But do not you use them ? 
Said Hagrid , 
- No , sir . 
Harry noticed that Hagrid squeezed the umbrella inside of a thick black coat when he distributed it to Ollivanders . 
He gave Hagrid a fierce look : 
- Hmm , okay , now let me see what wand is suitable for Potter . 
She took a silver wire from her pocket . 
- What is your hand holding chopsticks ? 
- I am right hand face . 
- Raise your hand . That's it . 
It was from Harry's shoulder to finger , and measured from wrist to elbow , from shoulder to floor , from hand to knee , and around the head . 
Meanwhile he said : 
Every Ollivanders wand has a mighty magic core , Potter . 
We used the ivory head feathers , phoenix tail feathers , and dragons . 
There are no Ollivanders in Ollivanders wand , because there are no two coded cynars , two phoenixes , or two dragons that look exactly the same . 
And 
Of course , you can not create the same power when using another witch's wand . 
Harry suddenly realized the meter , measuring the distance of his nostrils , automatically did the work alone . 
Ollivanders went to the shelves , took down some boxes . 
When he said : 
- Done . 
Then the automatic meter dropped to the floor . 
- okay , Potter , let's see this . 
Oak and dragon . 
Two and a half socks , beautiful and flexible . 
Just take it up and wave it up . 
Harry held the wand and ( feeling himself stupid ) waved a small ring . 
But Ollivanders snatched the wand immediately . 
- Try this tree . 
Likes and feathers . 
Three thirds . 
Pretty harmless . 
Harry tried , but he did not even raise the chopstick , but was oblivious to the Ollivanders . 
- No no . 
Try this tree . 
Ebony and feather unicorn . 
Two eight . 
Harry try . 
Then try it . 
It does not matter what the Ollivanders intend to wait for the miracle . a bunch of chopsticks he had tried to pile up on the rocking chair , but Ollivanders kept adding more chopsticks to try . 
And the more you try the more fun . 
- Think of us ? do not worried . 
We are looking for a perfect match tree somewhere in this chopstick . 
I'm wondering , yes , I do not try to make an unusual combination . 
Flies and feathers . 
Hat all nine . beautiful and malleable . 
Harry mopped the chopsticks . 
He suddenly felt a stream of warmth infused into his fingertips . 
He raised his stick up high above his head , waving one between the dust in the shop . 
A series of sparkling red gold rushes out from the end of the chopsticks like pyrotechnics , forming the spotlight dancing on the wall . 
Hagrid sobbed and Ollivanders burst into tears . 
- Oh , cheers . That's right , oh , good . 
Ừ . Good . Good . How strange , how strange 
Placing Harry's wand back into the box , wrapped in a brown paper , still murmured : 
- strange strange 
Harry asked : 
- I'm sorry , but what's strange ? 
Ollivanders stared at Harry's face : 
- I remember all my wands sold , Potter . 
Each one . 
Incidentally , how the phoenix gave the feather to his wand also added a feather - and only one . 
Strangely enough , but it was true that the feather in my wand was the brother of the feather that made the chopsticks scar on my forehead . 
Harry gasped , rolling his eyes . 
- How strange life . 
Remember , witches choose witches . 
I believe we can expect you great things , Potter . After all , he - who - does - not - call - name - out has done great things . 
Terrible but also great . 
Harry shivered . 
He was not sure he liked Ollivanders . 
He paid seven gold Galleons to buy the wand , and Ollivanders bowed to the two of them to the door . 
Late in the afternoon , the sun was hovering over the horizon as Harry and Hagrid returned to the Alley , across the wall , back to Leaky Cauldron , which was deserted . 
Harry did not say anything when they both went down the street . 
He did not even notice how the two of them looked at each other when they both went down to the subway station , their arms , their armpits , their backs of boxes of funny figures , and a white owl . Sleeping in the cage that Harry hugged in his lap . 
To the station , when Hagrid patted Harry's shoulder , he realized where he was . 
Said Hagrid . 
- There is enough time to eat something before my train runs . 
He bought Harry a meat sandwich and they both sat on the bench and ate . 
Harry looked around . 
Everything looks so weird . 
Hagrid asked : 
- Are you sure Harry ? 
Why are you silent ? 
Harry was not sure he could explain it . 
It is going through the most wonderful birthday ever . 
He just chewed on a mince to make a few words to say . 
Finally , it also made a few words : 
" Everybody thinks special , all the people at Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Ollivanders , but I do not know any magic at all . 
Why are they looking forward to the great thing about you ? 
You are famous for not being able to remember what you are famous for . 
I do not know what happened when Vol , forget , I want to say is the night the three damned baby 
Hagrid leaned across the table , his thick bearded face close to Harry's face , and his beard was a kindly smile : 
- do not worry baby 
I will study fast hurriedly . 
Everyone starts at the beginning of Hogwarts . 
I will pass it all , no problem . 
I know it will be hard work . 
You will have to strive alone , not easy . 
But you will have a wonderful life in Hogwarts . 
I have experienced that I am still living my life there . 
Hagrid helped Harry up the subway to take him back to the Dursleys home . 
He gave it a letter . 
- this is your ticket to Hogwarts . 
September one . 
King's Cross . 
The ticket clearly stated . 
If there is a problem with the Dursley family , send it to me . 
That owl knows where to find me . 
See you again , Harry . 
The subway departs from the station . 
Harry wanted to look at Hagrid until he was out of sight . 
He stared back at the window of the carriage , but only blinked at the fact that Hagrid had disappeared . 
Chapter 06 : THE GAINS OF GA CHIN - BA - PART - TU 
The last summer Harry lived at the Dursleys house was not happy at all . It is true that Dudley is now so afraid of Harry that he does not dare to be in Harry's presence . 
And Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are no longer trapped under the stairs , no longer do it , nor scream . 
The fact is , they do not even talk to it now . 
In the middle of anger , they acted as if there was no Harry in their home . 
Although in many ways , it can be considered as an improvement , but it is always stressful . 
Harry huddled in his room , making friends with the owl . 
It decided to name the owl Hedwig . 
This name is found in the History of Magic . 
Its new textbooks are very interesting . 
He kept lying on the bed reading books late at night , Hedwig fluttering out in the window of the inspiration . 
Luckily , Mrs. Dursley did not clean up anymore , because Hedwig kept mice dead . 
Every night before going to bed , Harry again crossed out a day in the piece of paper it was pasted on the wall , counting how many days left until September . 
On the last day of August , he thought he should anyway tell his aunt about it having to go to the King Cross Station the next day . 
He went to the living room , where the whole Dursleys were watching a quiz show on the television . 
It clears up for people to know it's there . 
Dudley ran out of gas and ran out of the room . 
- Dear Uncle 
Mr. Dursley hummed to let him know he was listening . 
- I need to cross the King Cross Station tomorrow to get to Hogwarts . 
Mr. Dursley grunted . 
- Could you give me your child to go to the station ? 
Umm 
Harry said that was OK . 
- Thank you , Uncle . 
He was about to return to his room , Uncle Dursley said , 
- go to school witches that go by electric car , the corn is real . 
Do not wash the carpet soaked dry ah ? 
Harry did not say anything . 
- Where is that school ? 
Harry thought about this for the first time . 
Oh , where's the school ? 
- I do not know . 
He picked up the ticket for the ticket Hagrid had given him . 
It reads : 
- You only need to take the train leaving the station of nine or three quarters at eleven . 
Uncle her eyes glazed asked : 
- What number platform ? 
- nine - three - part - four . 
Uncle Dursley said : 
- talk crazy ! 
Do not have a nine - ba - quarter - way station ! 
- My ticket is so . 
- How to bark , bark , flood now have all the crap crazy . Let's see . 
You just wait and see . Okay , I ' ll take you to the King Cross Station . Anyway we are going to London tomorrow , not that not a little where to disturb . 
Trying to find friendliness , Harry asked : 
- What's going on in London ? 
Uncle Dursley growled : 
- took Dudley to the hospital to remove the demon's tail before entering Smelting School . 
The next morning , Harry woke up at five o ' clock . 
He was so excited that he could not sleep . 
He got up his jeans , because he did not want to go to the station in his sorceress suit . 
When it goes on board it will replace it . 
She searched the list of things she needed to enter Hogwarts again , to make sure she did not miss anything . 
Hedwig 
carefully locked in closed cages . 
Finished , she went down the hall and waited for the Dursleys to wake up . 
Two hours later , Harry's heavy chest was loaded onto Mr. Dursley's car . 
Dursley begged Dudley to sit next to Harry . 
And the car ran . 
They arrived at the King's Cross station for ten and a half hours . 
Mr. Dursley stuffed Harry's chest into a trolley and pushed it into the platform . 
Harry was thinking about this extraordinary kind of extraordinaryness , and Mr. Dursley stopped short . 
He looked at the platforms with a faint smile on his face . 
- Come on baby . 
Station number nine , ten . 
Your station is in the middle of nowhere , but you sure are not finished ? 
Of course Mr. Dursley is absolutely correct . 
There is a very large 9 on the platform , and a very large 10 on the other side . 
And there is nothing between the two platforms . 
Mr. Dursley laughed even more : 
- go to school for good . 
He left without saying any more . 
Harry turned around and saw the Dursley family drove , the three of them in the car laughing . 
Harry's mouth became dry . 
What should he do ? 
Many began to look at it with a teasing look , as it embraced Hedwig . 
It must be asking someone . 
He picked up a guard to ask , but did not dare mention the nine - thirds - quarter station . 
The guard had never heard of Hogwarts Academy , and since Harry could not tell where Hogwarts was in any part of England , he began to get annoyed , as if Harry had deliberately faked it . 
Frustrated , Harry asked whether the train departed at eleven o ' clock . 
But the guard said no trip . 
Where he finally left , it was a waste of time . 
Harry tried not to panic at the moment . 
According to the big clock on the notice board , it took ten minutes to board the train to Hogwarts , which did not know how to get on board . 
He was trapped in the middle of the platform with a big chest that could not handle , in his pocket only a witch , and only one owl in his pocket . 
Hagrid must have forgot something , like typing on a brick 
Three from the left to open the gate to Alley Cross . 
She was wondering whether to pull out the wand , tap the ticket counter between platform number nine and platform number ten . 
At that moment a group of people came up behind him and he heard a few sentences they were saying . 
- full of Muggle kids , you know 
Harry whirled . 
The speaker is a fat lady mip . 
She was chatting with four boys , all with red hair . 
Each of them pushed in front of a chest like Harry's - and they all had a shot . 
With his chest unbroken , Harry immediately pushed the chest under them . 
They stopped , Harry stopped , close enough to hear better what they said . 
The mother told her son : 
- See what platform number ? 
- nine - three - part - private ! 
A little girl , also red hair holding mother's hand pleading : 
- Mama , I want to go 
- I'm not old enough to go to school with Ginny . 
Yah All right , Percy , you go ahead . 
The son who seems to be the eldest of them goes straight to platform number nine and platform number ten . 
Harry looked at him carefully , not blinking at once to keep him from losing . 
But just as he reached the fence of the two platforms , a crowd of tourists pulled over Harry . 
When the last backpacker came out of Harry's vision , the other boy was gone . 
The woman said , 
- Fred , come on baby . 
One of the remaining boys said , 
- I'm not Fred , I'm George . 
Really , ma ' am , she claims to be our mother , so can not you tell me George ? 
- Sorry , George . 
- Just kidding , Fred . 
He finished running away , his twin brother rushed to run to call him . 
They should not run so fast . 
Just one is the runner before the target . 
But where to go ? 
Harry could not understand . 
Now his third son was creasing his fence . 
It is almost there , suddenly suddenly very sudden , not lose it again . 
Nothing happened . 
Harry asked the muse : 
- Please ask my uncle 
She replied . 
- Hi , first time to Hogwarts ? 
Your Ron's house is brand new . 
She pointed to her youngest son . 
He was tall , skinny , clumsy , freckled , with large toes , and long nose . 
Harry replied , 
- But but I do not know how to do 
- How on the court ? 
The good woman mumbled , Harry nodded . 
She said : 
- do not worry , all you have to do is go into the fence between platform number nine and platform number ten . Do not stop and do not be afraid of stabbing it , this is very important . 
It's best to run a little faster if you're scared . 
Go ahead , go ahead Ron . 
- oh . 
Harry greeted and pushed his chest back , staring at the fence . 
Looks very solid . 
It starts to go toward that . 
People crossed over to reach the station number nine or ten . 
It goes faster . 
He was about to hit the fence and how it got in trouble . 
Referred to the trolley , it rushed to push the car quickly . 
The fence is closer , closer and closer . 
It can not be closed anymore . 
The trolley wants to go beyond it and drag it along . 
Only one step away from the fence . 
He closed his eyes closed to see a fierce fierce . 
But that did not happen , Harry kept pushing the car . 
He opened his eyes . 
In front of it was a bright red steam engine waiting on the track next to the passenger railroad platform . 
A sign posted on top of the Hogwarts logo , off at eleven o ' clock . 
Harry looked back and saw a crude iron gate right in front of the fence , on the porch which read : Nine - three - quarter station . 
So Harry got into the nine - third - quarter yard . 
The smoke from the locomotives boarded the crowds while chatting , while the full - grown cats wandered around . 
Bon juggling each other in the style of a viper , between the flicker and the bay chest boxed in each other . 
The first wagons were full of students , some of them still poked their heads out the window talking to their families , the other kids were fighting each other for seats . 
Harry filled his luggage car down the station looking for an empty seat , passing a round - faced boy who was crying : 
- Grandma , I'm kidnapping again ! 
- Oh Neville ! - Harry heard the sigh of an old woman . 
The other corner , another boy with his hair in the middle of a crowd pleading : 
- Let's take a look , Lee . 
Take a look . 
He hugged the box he was holding in his arms . 
The children around screamed , spiritedly jump back when a long leg of hair out of the box . 
Harry squeezed the crowd until he reached an empty carriage near the end of the train . 
He pushed Hedwig first and then struggled with his huge chest , lifting it as he pushed the chest toward the wagon door . 
Harry tried to pull the chest up one by one , but there was no way to lift one of the chests , and he had fallen on his feet twice . 
While struggling painfully , he heard a voice say : 
- Need a helping hand ? 
It turned out to be one of the two red - haired brothers that Harry had followed from outside the ticket booth . 
Harry gasped : 
- Oh ! 
Thank you . 
- Hey , Fred ! 
Come here to help one hand ! 
Thanks to the twin brothers , Harry finally managed to get the chest in a corner of the train . 
He stroked his sweaty hair on his forehead and said , 
- Thank you ! 
Suddenly , one of the twin brothers pointed to the lightning scar on Harry's forehead , exclaiming : 
- What ? 
- Are you ? - the second child stammered . 
- yes , he is - the first baby to say - right ? 
Harry looked puzzled : 
- What's right ? 
Both brothers said in unison : 
- Harry Potter . 
- Oh , it - Harry broke out - Well , I mean , yes , that's me . 
The other two boys looked at Harry , making him embarrassed . 
At that moment , outside the train door , a soft voice made Harry nervous . 
- Fred ? 
George ? 
Are you in it ? 
- Come on , mama . 
Two brothers looked at Harry again before jumping out of the carriage . 
Harry sat down by the window , barely visible , but could see the red - haired family standing on the platform and heard their conversation . 
The maid draws a handkerchief : 
- Ron , there is something on the nose . 
The youngest of the wigglers dodged , but the mother took her neck and wiped her nose with a handkerchief . 
It's wavy : 
- Mom let go . 
One of the two said , 
Ronnie bowed his nose 
- Shut up ! - shouted Ron . 
Their mother asked : 
- Where is Percy ? 
- Photo is coming . 
the largest of the brothers appeared . 
He changed into the Hogwarts student's large black uniform and Harry saw in his chest a silver insignia , on which was an alphabet P . 
I said : 
- Where are you ? 
I'm at the top of the car . 
There are two separate voices for the heads . 
One of the two twins seemed puzzled : 
- Reason ? 
Are you the boss , Mr. Percy ? 
You should have said it ! 
We do not know anything . 
" Yes , " said the second twin , choking . " Wait , I remember one time saying something about the boss . 
Looks like there was once 
- About twice 
- to remember 
- Looks like talking through the summer 
Brother Percy said : 
- Oh , come on ! 
But one of the twin brothers still wonders : 
- But why does Percy still have a new uniform ? 
The mother said with affection : 
- Because brother is the leader . 
Well , dear , wish you a good school year . 
Please send your cheeks when you arrive ! 
She kissed Percy's cheeks and sent him away . Then she turned to the twins advised : 
- Now , you two are behaving , this year you have grown up . 
If you have received a message saying that you have done things such as toilet bowl explosion or 
- The toilet bowl explode ? 
Where did the toilet bowl blow up ? - a twin cried . 
But the second twin said , 
- Did you mean that ? Thank you ! 
- I'm not joking . 
Remember to look after Ron . 
- Do not worry . 
There is no guarantee that Ron's little baby will do anything . 
- Shut up . 
Shouted Ron again . 
It was about as high as his twin brothers , and his nose was pink because of his mother's torment . 
- A , Ø cheek guess , guess who we met on the train today ? 
Harry leaned back against the chair so the red - haired family could not see it . 
- Do you remember the black - haired boy standing near you in the street ? 
Do you know who it is ? 
- Who ? 
- Harry Potter . 
Harry listened to the little girl's voice : 
- Oh , my cheeks to the car wagon looking at a home , cheeks ! 
One thing 
- Not Ginny . 
I've seen people . 
People are not strange in the zoo for you to stare at . 
Is not he , Fred ? 
How do you know ? 
- I asked it . 
I see the scar of it . The scar is just like lightning . 
- Poor . 
What's wrong with me ? 
Earlier it asked her cheek at the platform that very polite , too sinful ! 
- Well , cheeks ! 
Is it possible to remember who - well - know - who - what - is he ? 
Mother's face : 
- I forbid you ask it . 
Raw soul . 
Never touch that . 
Does it need to be reminded of that terrible thing on the first day of school ? 
- I can rest assured . 
A boat whistle sounded . 
- Go on the train to the children ! 
The mother rushed , her three sons hurried up the wagon . 
They leaned out the window for her mother to kiss her , and her youngest daughter cried out . 
- do not cry Ginny . 
We will send many , many hits for you . 
- We will also send you a toilet bowl Hogwarts . 
- George ! 
- I cheat on you ! 
Train began to turn the cake . 
Harry saw the mother standing waving at her children and her sister crying as she ran along the train until the ship speeded away from her . 
She struggled to her feet . 
Harry was still staring at her and she was starving until they were hidden behind the curves of the train . 
Through carriage windows , fast - surfing homes . 
Harry was nervous . 
He did not know what he was going to do . 
Doing what , it is probably better than the things that it left behind . 
The open door of the train opened and the youngest of the red - haired brothers poked their head in . 
Pointing to Harry opposite , he asked : 
- Does anyone sit here without you ? 
All other places . 
Harry shook his head , the boy sat down . 
He glanced at Harry and looked quickly out the window , pretending not to look at Harry . 
On the nose it still has a black spot . 
- Hey , Ron . 
The twins returned , one child said : 
- Ron , we got in the middle of the car - Lee Jordan has a huge hairy spider on it . 
Ron elected . 
- Ừ . 
The second twin says , 
- Harry forgot to introduce us . 
These are Fred and George Weasley . 
This is Ron , our brother . 
Hen see you later . 
Hello ! 
Harry and Ron both said , 
- Hello ! 
Two brothers spleared through the next . 
The doors closed behind them . 
Asked Ron , 
- You are Harry Potter really ? 
Harry nodded . 
- Really ? 
So I just stabbed him Fred and George said jokingly . 
So you have one 
He pointed to Harry's forehead . 
Harry reached out and pulled his hair on his forehead , revealing a lightning scar . 
Ron looked at the scars . 
- So that is where the - who - who - also - know - is - who - it was 
- Right . 
Said Harry , " but I do not remember anything about it . 
- Do not remember anything slick ? 
- Ờ remember blue light , but can not remember anything more . 
- Wow ! 
Ron stared at Harry for a moment , then suddenly realized his actions were rude , so he turned to look at the window quickly . 
Harry was curious about Ron equally . 
He asked Ron : 
- Are you both a witch ? 
Ron replied : 
- Right . 
I think it looks like my mother has a cousin who is an accountant , but my house never mentioned him . 
- So you know a lot of magic ? 
The Weasley family is clearly one of the longtime sorcerers that the little boy Harry met at the Cross mentioned . 
Asked Ron : 
- I heard you live with the Muggle people ? 
How are they doing ? 
- Terrible ! - Well , not all of them are bad . 
Only my aunt and uncle are new . 
I wish I had three sorcerers as well . 
Ron corrected : 
- Five people cheat . 
Ron said , but Ron's face was bewildered : 
- I'm the sixth child in school to attend Hogwarts . 
How much pressure is on the head : must be worthy of his brother . 
Bill and Charlie went to school , Bill headed the boys , and Charlie was the captain of the Quidditch team . 
Now Mr. Percy is the leader . 
Fred and George are very scary , but they always get good grades and everyone likes the junkiness of the two . 
Everyone expects to be as good as their brothers , but if they are good , they will not get anywhere , because the other men do first . 
Up to five brothers he can not have anything new . 
I wear old Bill's old shirt , use his old wand , his mouse is also his old mouse Percy does not play anymore . 
Ron hooked up in a jacket pocket and stared at a dark gray rat . 
- It's called Scabbers , it's useless . 
It's rare to see him awake , he always sleeps . 
Percy was given three prizes for owning as a leader . 
But my parents did not have enough money to say that I could use my mouse . 
Ron's ears were red . 
He thought it said too much . 
He turned away , staring out the window . 
Harry felt nothing embarrassing if one could not afford an owl . 
After all , his life has never had money , until last month . 
So it told Ron all about it had to wear Dudley's old clothes and never get a good birthday present . 
Harry's story seems to make Ron happy . 
- Until Hagrid told me , I know that I have a witch race , to know about my parents , about Voldemort 
Ron heard that suddenly blurted . 
Asked Harry , 
- What's going on ? 
Whispered Ron , in awe and admiration : 
- Bo has called the name of the rice - who - who - also - know - is - who - there . 
All of you , I think , have only you 
- Oh , I do not mean to be brave or heroic when calling him out like that ! 
I did not know that I should not call that . 
Do you know what I mean ? 
I'm sure I have a lot to learn . 
- Then Harry added , his voice anxious , about the recent thing that bothered him the most : 
- I'm afraid I'm over the top ! 
- No . There are a lot of people from the Muggle family who still study well as usual ! 
Ron comforted . 
As they both continued to talk , the train took them out of London . 
Now it is soaring through the fields of sheep and grazers . 
Both of them were silently watching the fast surfing scene . 
About twelve and a half hours , there was a creaking sound outside the corridor and an old lady dimpled , smiled at the door , and asked : 
- What dish do you use ? 
Harry , for breakfast , stood up . 
But Ron was still sitting , his ears flushed red , the little boy smirked that he had brought his lunch bread . 
Harry stepped out into the hallway . 
Back at the Dursley Pharmacy , Harry had no silver coins to buy candy , but now his bag was filled with gold and silver coins , enough to buy all the Mars Bars so much that he could not hold it . 
But this smiling lady does not sell Mars Bars . 
She had only plastic candy , Bertie Bott , Droooble , Chocolate Frog , Pumpkin Pie , Pancakes , Licorice Lollipop , and many other strange things that Harry had never seen before . . 
Harry wanted to know all the stuff , he bought a few things , and only paid her for the sale of ten Sickle and seven Knuts . 
When Harry had taken all of them , pouring down the couch , Ron looked up : 
- Are you hungry ? 
- hungry , want to die . 
Harry caught a big pumpkin pie filled his mouth . 
Meanwhile , Ron hooks in his pockets a packet of clutter and begins to open . 
Inside there are four pieces of bread . 
He took off a piece and said : 
- I forget that I do not like salt beef . 
Harry holds a piece of cake for Ron to invite : 
- for this mess ! 
Try it 
Looking at his pie , Ron said , 
- You can not eat this dish ! 
Dry ! 
My mother hurried 
Ron said quickly , 
- There are up to five children ! 
Harry had never before had anything to invite other people , now really want to share with his companion . 
- Eat this cake , eat it . 
It was a pleasant feeling to sit with Ron , eat all of Harry's cake , all the sweets , all the candy ( only some dry sandwiches were left ) . 
Holding a bunch of frog chocolates , Harry asked Ron : 
- What is this ? Where are the frogs ? 
It started to look less surprising . 
Ron replied : 
- Are not . 
But what is the inner card ? I lack Agrippa . 
- What ? 
- Oh , yeah , you do not know ? 
Each frog chocolate package is hidden inside a card for people to collect . 
Cards of the famous witches that . 
I collect about five hundred , but missing Agrippa and Ptolemy . 
Harry opened his bag of chocolate frogs , pulling out a card . 
On the card is a picture of a man . 
He wore a pair of semicircular glasses , with a long nose , a long white beard tumbling down like a waterfall . 
Underneath the portraiture is his name : Albus Dumbledore . 
Harry said : 
- So this is Dumbledore ! 
Said Ron : 
- Yes ! Do not tell me you never heard of Dumbledore ! 
Give me a clone , maybe in there Agrippa card Thank you 
Harry flips the card back , reading on the back : 
Albus Dumbledore , the current Hogwarts headmaster 
Considered to be the greatest witch of modern times , Dumbledore is particularly famous for winning the Grindewald sorcerer in 1945 ; by discovering the twelve uses of dragon blood , and his work with his colleague Nicolas Flamel on alchemy . 
Professor Dumbledore liked chamber music and threw ten bottles of beer . 
Harry turned over in front of the card , shocked at the sight of Dumbledore's disappearance . 
- The tool is gone ! 
- Why ? 
Do you think that gut slamming with me here and here ? 
Said Ron . 
- But he will come back Oh , boring , again Morgana card again . 
I have come after Mrs. Morgana ! 
Do you want to keep this card ? 
You can start collecting cards now . 
Ron's eyes did not leave the frosty chocolate box unopened . 
- Enjoy yourself . 
Harry invited . 
But you know , in the Muggles world , you take pictures and people are in the picture . 
- Really ? 
They do not move anything ? 
Ron was surprised . 
Ugh ! 
Harry stared at the card . 
He saw Dumbledore stepping back onto the card and smiling at it . 
Ron was more interested in eating frog chocolate than watching the famous witches , but Harry could not take his eyes off them . 
Not long after , it collected not only Dumbledore and Morgana , but also Hengist Woodcroft , Alberic Grunnion , Circe , Paracelsus , and Merlin . 
Finally , the Austrian priest , Cliilna , was bowing his nose . 
After a while , Harry stopped watching her put her nose on the picture , turning to open a few packs of lollipop , Bertie Bott . 
Ron reminded Harry : 
- Be careful with these items ! 
When they say it is enough , it means that they have enough . 
You know enough chocolate , mint , jam , but also vegetables , fish , pig's kidney , cow's hair . 
Brother George had a fire in the fire for them already ! 
Ron cupped a green pea candy , looked carefully , then sprayed in a corner . 
- Ẹ ! bitter ! 
Young roots 
But in the end , they both enjoyed sipping their soft candy . 
Harry tasted baked goods , coconut , baked beans , strawberries , curry , grass , coffee , sardines , and even tried a funny , funny chocolate that Ron did not touch . 
That turns out to be spicy like pepper . 
Through the window car wagon , rural landscape is spreading . 
Now , no more plentiful fields . 
Instead , there are wild woods , meandering rivers , and dark green hills . 
There was a knock on the door and he had a round face that Harry had met at the nine - third - quarter stage . 
It looks like a baby . 
She asked : 
- Sorry , did anyone see my toad ? 
When Harry and Ron both shook their heads , the boy cried out desperately : 
- I lost it . 
He just left me to go nostalgic ! 
Harry comforted : 
- It will come back . 
The child said sadly : 
- Yes , but you see it 
To that he left . 
Said Ron : 
- Do not know why it is so miserable ? 
If I have a toad , I just want to lose it , as soon as possible . 
Oh , but I can not say , I have Scabbers too ! 
The rat was still sleeping on Ron's lap . 
Ron looked disgusted . 
- Even if it is dead , death or not is not distinguishable . 
Yesterday I tried changing it to yellow to make it look boring , but recite the nostalgic nostalgia that is not . Let me just show you , look 
Ron rummaged in the chest , took out a wand , looked tasseled , scratched tail , the tip of the wand stuck white things . 
The unicorn's hair is out . 
But still use 
Ron waved his wand open again . 
The kid came back , but this time with him was a girl . 
The girl in the brand new Hogwarts uniform , asked : 
- Does anyone see a toad ? 
Neville lost a toad . 
The voice of the girl as dreadful as the boss . 
Thicker brown hair , plus a few large toothed teeth . 
Said Ron : 
- This was told to us not once . 
But she did not listen , just stared at Ron's wand . 
- Ah , doing magic ? 
Let's take a look ! 
She sat down . 
Ron is a bit stuck : 
- Yes . 
He cleared his throat : 
Sun , butter , chrysanthemum 
There is a fat rat 
Make it yellow 
Ron waved his wand , but nothing happened . 
Scabbers are still gray and continue to sleep . 
She said : 
- Are you sure that's a spell ? 
Did not eat anything ? 
Before I also have a few questions , to practice it ! 
Which sentence is all the same . At my house , no one knows how to spell , so when I received the letter of admissions I was surprised . 
But of course I liked it , because I heard it was the most famous sorcerer school . 
I have memorized all the textbooks . 
Hope is enough to study . 
By the way , please introduce yourself , I'm Hermione Granger , who are you ? 
The child said purple and then stopped waiting . 
Harry watched Ron lightly as he saw Ron's face unfurl , showing that he did not learn all the books in the program . 
Ron murmured : 
- I'm Ron Weasley . 
Harry said : 
- I'm Harry Potter . 
Cried Hermione . 
- Really ? 
I know all about you , of course ! 
I made some extra books , stories about you in the book The History of Modern Magic , The Rise and Fall of Dark Arts , and The Great Adventures of the Twentieth Century . 
Harry felt shocked : 
- me ? 
Hermione cried out : 
- Oh my God ! 
You do not know anything ? 
If I was a friend , I would have to read everything that was written about me . 
Then suddenly she changed her voice : 
- Well , does anyone know if I will be in a dormitory ? 
I have been asking all over , say Gryffindor is the best place , I hope to be there . 
It is said that Dumbledore himself was in Gryffindor . 
But the Ravenclaws were not that bad either . Now we have to find a frog for Neville . 
The two of you , dressing is medium , coming to the place , know ? 
She said and walked away with the kid missing . 
- No matter where you are at home , as long as you do not share the house with the baby . 
Said Ron . 
He threw his wand , 
- The foolish spell ! 
Probably George teasing himself , he knew it was a trick to teach him new pictures . 
Harry asked : 
- What's your dorm ? 
Said the dark face : 
- Gryffindor . 
My parents used to stay at home . 
If I was not chosen to go to that house , I do not know what my parents would say . 
I think the Ravenclaw family is not bad , but imagine that , if you were sent to the Slytherin to die ! 
- Is that where Vol - forgotten , who - whom - who - well - know - is - who - there , where ? 
- right . 
Said Ron , slumped into the chair , his face anxious . 
Harry wants Ron to forget the dorm , he's trying to talk another way : 
- You know , I see some Scabbers whiskers are a bit white . What are your two big brothers out of school ? 
Harry is wondering what a witch is doing . 
Ron replied : 
Charlie went to Rumania to study the dragon , and Bill went to Africa to do something for the Gringotts . 
Well , did you hear about Gringotts ? 
News posted on the newspaper that prophecy . 
But it must have been in the Muggle house for the readers . 
Newspaper said yesterday there is a robber pile of silver . 
Harry was shocked . 
- Really ? 
And then ? 
- No problem , so the news is new . 
They have not caught the robbers . 
I'm sure it was a dark wizard of the Dark side involved in the Gringotts , but the most weird is that they robbed without taking anything . 
Everyone is afraid , do not know who - who - also - know - is - who - there is no such thing . 
Harry thought about the Gringotts bank robbery . 
It started to feel a little chilly when it came to the name of the who - who - knows - who - knew - it . 
It seems like entering the wizarding world is a feeling of fear . 
But to be reminded of the name Voldemort without fear , it is much easier . 
Asked Ron : 
- What do you play for the Quidditch team ? 
- I do not know what 
This confession made Ron amazed : 
- What ? Then , it is the best sport in the world . 
And Ron tried to explain the four balls , about the position of the seven players , recounted the famous matches that he had seen with his brothers . 
Ron also talked about the spirits that he wished to buy if one day was cheap . As he leads the more sophisticated aspects of the game to Harry , the door to the carriage opens , but this time it's not the toddler kid or Hermione's kid . 
Stepping into this other three boys , Harry realized that the middle boy was the pale boy he had met at Malkin's clothing store in Alley Cross . 
He looked at Harry more excitedly than before . 
She asked : 
- Is not this right ? 
They say um all over the train there is Harry Potter in the car . 
So is that you ? 
- Right . 
Said Harry and looked at the two of them . 
He was strong and aggressive . 
They stood on the sides of the pale boy looking like a bodyguard . 
Seeing Harry looking at the other two , the pallid boy offered a lowly , 
" This is Crabbe , and this is Goyle . 
I'm Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . 
Ron coughed a few hours , probably to hiss . 
Draco Malfoy looked at Ron : 
- Do you find my name funny ? 
Your name is not asking me ! 
My dad told me all about your weasley red hair , his face was freckled , and he was too young to feed . 
He turned to Harry : 
- Potter , then you will see that there are more wizarding families . 
You do not make friends with ordinary people . 
That I can help you . 
He raised his hand to shake Harry's hand , but Harry did not grasp it . 
Harry just said coldly : 
- Thank you . 
I think I know too well any kid who is not normal ! 
Listen to that . 
Draco Malfoy was not blushing , but his cheeks were a bit dull . 
He slowly said : 
If I were you , Potter , I'd be a little more careful . 
You will then go to the dirt of your three mothers if you do not know more polite . 
The three mothers at that time did not know what was good for them . 
You go on with rags like the Weasley and Hagrid he is a ghost . 
Both Harry and Ron stood up . 
Ron's face flushed like hair on his head . 
- You say it again ! 
Draco Malfoy snorted at him . 
- Wanna fight with us ? 
- Well , if you do not leave this place right now . 
Harry said , his voice a bit shaky , but his heart was shaking because Crabbe and Goyle were bigger than him and Ron was a lot . 
- But we do not want to come out , are you ? 
We have eaten all our belongings , and you guys here seem to have leftovers of food . 
Goyle reached for the frog chocolates beside Ron . 
Ron leaped forward , but before he could capture Goyle , the man screamed in pain : Scabbers was wearing his Goyle finger , his sharp teeth poking into Goyle's skin . 
Goyle screamed , waving his mouse around the ring , but the mouse still refused to release . 
Finally , when the rat left and flew to the window , both Crabbe and Malfoy panicked . 
The three of them immediately disappeared . 
They probably thought the mice were waiting in the candy , or maybe they heard footsteps , as soon as Hermione stepped in . 
- What has just happened here ? 
She asked as she looked at the packs of candy scattered all over the floor and Ron was tapering the mouse Scabbers pulled up . 
- It must have been too ! 
Ron said to Harry . 
He looked at the mouse again . 
- Yeah , not really believe it , it's sleep again ! 
It was a rat sleeping in the litter . 
Asked Ron : 
- Before you knew Draco Malfoy ? 
Harry explained briefly at the Cross . 
Ron heard finished : 
- I heard about his family . 
They were the first to turn to our side after the one - to - one - who - was - gone vanished . 
They say they are enchanted . 
My dad did not believe me . 
My dad said that Malfoy's father should not have justified this one about being on the dark side . 
Turning to Hermione , Ron asked , 
- What do you need ? 
- You should change your uniform quickly . 
I just went up to the carriages and asked the ship's supervisor , he said we were close . 
Are you fighting ? 
Watch out for trouble before you get there . 
Ron scowled at Hermione : 
- Scabbers fight , not us . 
Can you please come out and change us ? 
- okay . 
I'm not here because there are people out there like a kid , running up and down the corridor . 
Well , by the way , I would like to note that your nose is sticky , you know ? 
Ron glared at her as she walked out . 
Harry poked his head out the window . 
God is getting dark . 
It can see the forest under the purple sky . the train seems to be slowing down . 
Harry and Ron took off their jacket and covered themselves in a black dress . 
Ron's nose was a little shorter than his body , showing off his shoes . 
A voice rang across the train : We were about to arrive at Hogwarts in five minutes . 
Baggage left on the train , someone will bring back to school . 
Harry's stomach was upset because of nervousness . 
Ron , too , under the freckles , his face was pale . 
The two filled the bag with the last candy packet and entered the crowd in the corridor . 
The train slowed down and finally stopped . 
People pushing each other , pounding the door , pouring down a small platform , dark . 
Harry shivered in the cold night . 
At that moment , a flashing light bulged above the students ' heads , and Harry heard a familiar voice : 
- First year student ! 
Year one here ! 
Harry , how are you ? 
Hagrid's hairy face glistened in the sea of ​​ his head . 
- Come here , follow me ! 
And first year students ? 
Step carefully ! 
First year students , follow me . 
Fumbling , the children followed Hagrid down a path that looked sloping and narrow . 
The sides of the road were so dark that Harry thought he was walking among dense trees . 
The crowd was silent . 
Neville's kid lost his fist , dare to whimper twice . 
Hagrid came forward , saying , 
- Min yet you will see Hogwarts for the first time ! 
This passage is seen right away . 
An umbrella is very loud echo . 
The narrow road suddenly opened up a vast black lake . 
On the other side of the lake , on the top of a high mountain is a magnificent castle with numerous large and small towers , and countless window panes dot the starry sky . 
Hagrid , a small boat waiting for the lake , shouted : 
- Into the boat . 
Each boat does not carry more than four people ! 
Neville and Hermione follow Harry and Ron on the boat . 
Harry , alone a boat , shouted again : 
- Everyone is on the boat ? 
Finished then move on ! 
Both crews left the port at once , across the lake as flat as a mirror . 
Everyone was silent , gazing up at the castle in front of him . 
It emerged as a giant tower , becoming more and more majestic as the convoy passed them through a curtain , ending with a spring rope hanging down , covering a wide open door on the cliff . 
This door leads into a dark tunnel , perhaps an underground passageway that leads to a harbor that is also deep in the ground . 
As they arrived , the children clambered up onto the beach full of stones . 
And Hagrid checked the boats for what was left . 
He exclaimed . 
- Oh , you ! 
Is this your toad ? 
Neville held out his hand : 
- Trevor ! 
The crowd continued to climb up a rocky passage , aiming at Hagrid's lamp that led to a more flat road , leading to the smooth , dewy grass that lay under the castle's shadow . 
The children jumped up on the steps and stood in front of the huge oak gate . 
- Everyone is full ? 
Is my toad still there ? 
After saying this , Hagrid held up a huge fist , punching the castle door three times . 
CHAPTER 07 : CLASSIFICATION 
The door of the castle immediately broke out . 
A tall , wicked sorceress , dressed in black , was dressed in blue jade . 
She had a stern face , so much so that the first thought that came to Harry's mind was to have no trouble with her . 
Hagrid introduced : 
- The first year students here , Professor McGonagall . 
- Thanks to Hagrid . 
You can give them back to me . 
She opened the door . 
The front room was so large that the original Dursley family house could still be found . 
The stone walls are illuminated by torches like the Gringotts . 
The high ceilings were hollowed out , and in front of the children were a magnificent marble staircase on the upper floors . 
The children followed Professor McGonagall across a towering slate . 
Harry could hear the sound of the hundreds of voices echoing behind the door on the right - perhaps the whole school was gathering here . 
But Professor McGonagall took the first - year kids into an empty little room at the end of the corridor . 
They stand on each other , waiting for anxiety anxiety in the neck . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Welcome to Hogwarts . 
The reception is about to begin , but before you pick up the seat in the hall , you will be sorted out to the dormitories . 
Classification is a very important one , because during the time you study here , your dormitory is just like your family at Hogwarts . 
You will study together , sleep together , play together with the students in a hostel . 
- There are four dormitories , here called the Gryffindor House , the Hufflepuff House , the Ravenclaw House and the Slytherin House . 
Each house has a noble history and every house has made excellent males and wizards . 
During your child's studies at Hogwarts , your achievements will be added to your overall score . 
At the end of the year , the home that gets the most points will receive a home cup - a great honor . 
I hope each one of you is a worthy member of your house , no matter which house you choose . 
- The ceremony will take place in the next few minutes , in front of all the teachers and students in the school . 
I suggest that you prepare for the correction while waiting for the ceremony . 
Her eyes widened on Neville's dumbbells ; Ron's sharp nose also seems to make professors unhappy . 
Harry tried his best to smooth his dirty hair down . 
- I will come back when you are ready . 
Said Professor McGonagall . 
- Keep silent ! 
She walked out of the room . 
Harry swallowed khan . 
He asked Ron : 
- What is the classification of the houses ? 
- Sure , they let me do something . 
Fred says it hurts , but he's probably talking . 
Harry's heart began to jolt . 
A test ? 
Before the school ? 
And it does not know what magic . 
What do you do ? 
Upon arriving at the school , Harry unexpectedly had to go through a checkup like this . 
He looked around and saw that no one was afraid to say anything , except that little Hermione kept repeating the mantra he had learned and was thinking about again . 
Harry tried not to hear . 
It has never been so stressful , including the one for Dursleys Aunty , which included the crime of making the professor's wig blush . 
Harry's eyes were fixed on the floor . 
In just a few seconds , Professor McGonagall will return and the number of people coming here will probably be ruined . 
Suddenly there was one thing that Harry jumped into the air all three inches , the children around him scream . 
- Oh ! 
What ? 
Harry gasped . 
All the children were gasping . 
About two dozen ghosts came out from the back wall , flipped across the room , chatted with each other , and did not care for the first - year students . 
Looks like they are fighting each other . 
A ghost looks like a monk saying : 
Forgive and forget , listen to me , let's give him a second chance 
" Brother , are not we giving too many opportunities to Peeves ? 
And he's still stubborn enough for us , and you know , he's not a real ghost , is he ? 
What are they doing here ? 
Her face was tight and she was suddenly aware of the presence of the children . 
He asked but did not dare to answer . 
The new monk looked around smiling : 
- Recent students . 
Probably to be classified right ? 
Some children nodded but remained silent . 
Next fat monk : 
- Hope to see you again in the house of Hufflepuff , his old house . 
Suddenly , a cold tone resounded : 
- Proceed before the classification ceremony is about to start . 
Professor McGonagall has returned , The ghosts are quietly drifting into the opposite wall , one by one . 
Professor McGonagall ordered : 
- Now you line up and follow me . 
Awkward awkwardness as if the legs had turned into lead , Harry stood in the line , behind a blonde boy . 
Ron was standing behind Harry , and the ladies came out of the room , across the corridor , through several pairs of doors and into the hall . 
Harry never imagined that there is such a strange and splendid place . 
The spacious room was illuminated by thousands of tens of thousands of candles , hovering in the air above the four long tables where all the students were sitting . 
On the table were golden plates and sparkling gold cups . At the head of the hall was another long table for the professor . 
Professor McGonagall led the first - year students toward this table , so that they stood facing the other students , with teachers behind them . 
Hundreds of faces gazed at them , looking like dim lanterns with flickering candles lit inside . 
Among the students are the ghosts that hide like silver mists . In order to avoid staring at him , Harry looked up and saw the dark arch of the house collapsing with stars . 
It is hard to believe that the top of the other is a ceiling and the hallway must have eaten through the sky . 
Harry heard Hermione whisper : 
- Looking out to get married . 
In the book of history Hogwarts recorded so . 
Harry looked down , just as Professor McGonagall put a four - foot - high chair in front of his first - year child . 
At the top of the chair was a spiked conical hat . 
The hats tasseled , patched patches , and extremely dirty . 
Aunt Petunia was sure to throw it in the garbage . 
- They would have to pull me out from a rabbit hat , or something like that . 
Harry is bewildered . 
He saw people sticking his eyes to the hat . 
He was also looking . 
For a few seconds , the space was quiet . 
Then the cone twisted , a piece of paper near the cone opened like a mouth , and the hat began to sing : 
This is not even me 
But do not look at looks 
In terms of intelligence , shrewdness 
Take a hat over my face 
Everybody wears a hat 
Hat , hat as you like 
All right , I accept this 
Hat : classification Hogwarts 
Things to hide do not say 
I read in the brain 
Brush and caress your hair 
put up , I say to hear 
Who's in Gryffindor ? 
The brave furnace brave 
Who's in Hufflepuff ? 
Training place for abstainers 
Difficult to make shy 
trustworthy , right - brained 
Who is at Ravenclaw ? 
Where to train fast ? 
Just study hard again 
Or Slytherin too 
Teach me to be wise 
Failure to reach the target 
Put on ! 
Let's do it ! 
Do not be afraid , listen to me 
Listen , we classify 
Who are you , at home ? 
Be calm , team up 
In the cone like warm hands . 
Finishing the song of the hat , the hall burst into clapping . 
The hilt bowed to the four directions and stood still . 
Ron whispered to Harry : 
- So I ' ll try that hat . 
Fred must be beaten to a new game , just like saying you have to fight with a giant demon . 
Hrry smiled weakly . Oh , it's easier to read the mantra , but it still worships the audience seeing it wearing a hat . 
The hat seems to require a bit more . 
Harry did not feel brave , intelligent , or cunning at the moment . 
If the hat in Hogwarts had a home for those who felt restless and nauseous , then it would be best for Harry at the moment . 
Professor McGonagall stepped forward with a thick roll of parchment in his hand : 
- When I call someone's name , he's just wearing a hat and sitting on a chair . 
Started : Hannah Abbott ! 
A little baby with rosy cheeks and blonde braids stepped out of the line , put on a hat and sat down . 
The hat covered her eyes . 
Quiet for a moment . 
The hat shouts : 
- Hufflepuff House . 
The people at the table on the right boasted and applauded . 
Hannah goes to sit at the Hufflepuff table . 
Harry saw the ghost of the fat monk waving happily at Hannah . 
- Next , Susan Bones ! 
- Hufflepuff House . 
The hat cried out again , and Susan quickly went to sit next to Hannah . 
- Terry Boot ! 
- Ravenclaw House . 
The second row of the left hand claps ; many Ravenclaw members get up and shake hands with Terry ; the boy came to their table . 
- Mandy Brocklehurst ! 
Also the house of Ravenclaw . 
And : 
- Lavender Brown ! 
Become the first to receive Gryffindor . 
The last row of the table burst out cheering and clapping . 
Harry saw Ron's twin brothers whistling . 
- Millicent Bulstrode ! 
He was assigned to the Slytherin home . 
It may have been imagined by Harry , or because he had heard of Slytherin too much , but he did find the skorns unattractive . 
Now Harry was beginning to see the disease . 
He remembered picking players for the old sloop . 
It is always the last chosen person . 
Not because it's bad , but because nobody wants Dudley to think that he likes Harry . 
- Justin Finch - Fletchley ! 
- Hufflepuff House . 
Harry noticed when the team entered the hat to announce the results immediately , but in some cases it seemed that it hesitated a moment and then reported results . 
- Seamus Finnigan ! 
The blond boy stood in line with Harry . 
He had to sit in his chair for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him home Gryffindor . 
- Hermione Granger ! 
She ran back to the chair and shot the hat on her head . 
The hat shouts : 
- Gryffindor House . 
Ron heard the grinding teeth clenched . 
A horrible idea popped up in Harry's mind : What if it was not for you ? 
What if I had to wait for the endless seat of the chair , with the hat falling to my eyes , and Professor McGonagall came out of the hat saying that there was a mistake and invited him to go out on a train ? 
When Neville Longbottom - the boy who was missing forever - was called , it went so fast , that there was a short stroll to the seat that also stumbled several times . 
The hat takes a long time to decide the fate of Neville . 
- Gryffindor House ! 
Neville jumped , forgetting to open his hat . 
He had to run back into the laughter of the people to give Professor McGonagall a hat , which he stumbled upon as MacDougal Morag . 
Malfoy's pale turn . 
He went ahead and got the wish right away : The hat had not even touched the head it had declared immediately : 
- Slytherin House ! 
Malfoy joins Crabbe and Goyle , who looks extremely satisfying . 
There are still more people . 
- Moon ! , 
- Nott ! , 
- Parkinson ! 
Then two twins : 
- Patil and Patil ! , 
And then : 
- Perks ! , 
- Sally - Anne ! , 
And then finally : 
- Harry Potter ! 
As Harry stepped forward , he heard whispers rising on all sides . 
- Does the teacher call Potter ? 
- Does the teacher call Harry Potter ? 
The last thing Harry saw before the hat fell down covered his eyes , the whole hall filled with eyes looking at him . 
Harry waited . 
He heard a voice in his ear : 
- Wow ! 
Hard here ! 
Very difficult . 
Courage is too much wisdom is also very talented , love , talented devils , and the desire to assert themselves ! 
Cool ! 
What do you want me to separate feces ? 
Harry gripped the chair thinking : 
- do not be Slytherin . Do not be Slytherin ! 
- Do not tolerate Slytherin ? 
The voice of the ear sounded small . 
- Are you sure ? 
You can become great , you know , there's everything in your head , and Slytherin will make you big , so sure . Well , if you were definitely better than Gryffindor . 
Harry listened to the last of the hat that was loud enough for the whole hall to hear . 
He opened his hat and walked to Gryffindor's table , his legs trembling . 
It was so lighthearted that he was not chosen to be in Slytherin , so much so that he did not notice the cheering sound of it all the time . 
Leader Percy stood up and shook it handily , while the Weasley twins shouted : 
- We have Harry Potter ! 
We have Harry Potter ! 
Harry sits downstairs , facing the ghost wearing a folded necklace he had seen before . 
The ghost patted his arm , making it shudder , feeling as if someone grabbed it and dipped it in ice cold water . 
From this seat , Harry could now see the high table . 
He saw Hagrid at the bottom of the table , looking at him and raising a thumbs up for praise . 
He grinned at Hagrid . 
And there , in the middle table , on a large golden chair , was Albus Dumbledore . 
Harry can see him right away by looking at the stuff on the card in the frog chocolate package . 
Dumbledore's silver hair is the only thing in the hall that shines like ghosts . 
Harry also recognized Professor Quirrell , who had spoken to him at Leaky Cauldron . 
He looked rather odd with a large purple band on his head . 
And now there are only three pupils left . 
- Dean Thomas ! 
As a black boy taller than Ron , Gryffindor was sitting next to Harry . 
- Lisa Tupin ! 
This girl came home to Ravenclaw . 
And finally Ron's turn . 
It was like a banana leaf . 
Harry placed two cross fingers under the table to pray , and a few seconds later , the hat declared : 
- Gryffindor House ! 
Harry clapped his hands madly as Ron walked toward him and nearly collapsed into the next chair . 
- Good , Ron ! 
Excellent ! 
Brother Percy - Ron's brother , screaming triumphantly . 
Professor McGonagall rolled out the list and removed the cone . 
Harry looked at the empty gold plates . 
Then I realized that I was hungry . 
The pumpkin pie that it eats on the train seems to have been digested for generations . 
Dumbledore stood up . 
Smiling with all the students , arms wide open , as if nothing seems to make him happy than to see all his students here . 
He said : 
- Welcome children to the new school year at Hogwarts . 
Before you party , we have some words to say . 
Those words are stupid ! 
Crybaby ! 
Trivia ! 
Pinch Thank you ! 
He sat down . 
My clap clap . 
Harry did not know whether to laugh or not . 
He doubted Percy : 
- Is it cool stuff ? 
- Cool ? 
Peeves said happily : 
- You are a genius ! 
The best witch in the world ! 
But , yeah , yeah , it's a bit cooler too . 
Did potatoes not Harry ? 
Harry gasped in surprise ! 
The empty plates in front of him are now filled with food . 
She never saw much of her favorite food on the table : ham , lamb , sausage , boletus , steak , potato chips , chips , bread Yorkshire , beans , carrots , sauces , tomato sauce , and be sure to get ridiculous , including the bugs . 
The Dursleys did not really starve Harry , but he was never allowed to eat it . 
Again , Dudley always won nothing that Harry liked , even though Dudley did not really need it . 
Harry had a little bit of it , except for the bug , and started eating . 
Cool cat . 
The ghost dressed in his shirt stood next to him . 
He looked sadly at Harry to cut the steak : 
- Looks delicious ! 
Harry offered to invite : 
- Do not you eat ? 
The ghost said : 
- I have not eaten for nearly four hundred years . 
Of course we do not need to eat anymore , but we still remember eating habits . 
Looks like I have not introduced myself yet ? 
I am Nicolas de Mimsy - Porpington in the Gryffindor Tower . 
- A ! 
I know who you are ! 
Ron heard a sudden shout . 
- My brother told me about him - he was Nick nearly lost his head . 
The devil : 
- I ask you to call me Mr. Nicolas de Mimsy . 
But the blonde boy , Seamua Finningan , interrupted : 
- almost lost head ? 
How come he nearly lost his head ? 
Mr. Nicolas was very unhappy , as if this crappy story goes in completely unintended direction . 
Very anxious , he replied irritably : 
- Like this one 
He holds up his left ear . 
The head slipped out of her neck , lowering her shoulders like a hook . 
Suddenly there was someone trying to slash his head , but perhaps he did not work very cleverly . 
Frowning on the faces of the children , Nick nearly lost his head . 
He put his head on the old position , coughed and said : 
- So , new Gryffindor residents . 
I hope you will help us win this year's championship , okay ? 
Never had Gryffindor lost such a position for so long . 
The Slytherins have kept the trophy for six years . 
Baron bloody increasingly unpredictable unbearable . 
He's a Slytherin ghost . 
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there , two empty eye sockets gazing at each other , a sad face , and a bloody , bloody gown . 
The ghost sat next to Malfoy , and Harry gladly noticed that Malfoy seemed resentful of being seated . 
Seamus asked excitedly , 
- How could he be so bloody ? 
Nick loses his head to be delicate : 
- I never asked him about it . 
After everyone had eaten their meal , the leftover food on the plate automatically disappeared , suggesting the dishes as clean as before . 
Later , the dessert appeared . 
Cream topped with enough flavors , biscuits , creamed chocolate , jams , peas , strawberries , jellies , crepes . 
Harry himself rolled a piece of honey . 
At this point the gossip has turned to the subject of the family . 
Seamus says : 
- I am half and half . 
My dad is a Muggle . 
Me did not tell my dad that she was a witch . 
When married , my father . 
A terrible shock to him . 
The children around laughed . 
Asked Ron : 
- What about you , Neville ? 
- My grandmother raised me , my grandmother is a witch . 
But my whole family still thinks I'm only a hundred percent Muggle . 
Algie's left over when I did not suggest trying to find out if I have any spells . 
Once he brought my country outside the port , I die forever ! 
But nothing special happens . 
It was not until I was eight that upstairs , Algie's father came to tea , he took my ankles out of the window . So Enid gave him a pile of eggs , he accidentally let me out to take the cake . 
I fall down the road and then back up , rolling out the garden , no problem . 
My grandmother was crying . 
Everyone is happy . 
Just like you see them when I get a call to school . 
Everybody thinks I am not talented enough to go to school . 
Algie's so happy to buy me a frog ! 
Next to Harry , the heads of Percy and Hermione are chatting about the work ( roughly : I hope they start school , there is a lot to learn , he especially likes transformation , you know , This is another one , of course it is very difficult . 
I will start with small things , such as turning a match into a needle . ) 
Harry began to feel full of warmth and drowsiness , looking up at the tall table . 
Hagrid was drunk . 
Professor McGonagall talked to Dumbledore . 
Professor Quirrell , head of a large band , was talking to some black - haired , black - haired , black - haired teachers . 
Then , very quickly , very suddenly , the tufted nose teacher , through Professor Quirrell's scarf , looked straight into Harry's eyes . 
A throbbing pain from Harry's forehead . 
- Oh ! 
Harry rubbed his forehead . 
Percy asked : 
- What's going on ? 
- Kh nothing . 
The pain disappears in the blink of an eye . 
But what Harry received at the sight of the other professor's nose was not easy to pass . 
Harry felt he did not like it at all . 
He asked Percy : 
- Who is talking to Professor Quirrell ? 
- Ah , did you know Professor Quirrell ? 
What's so he seems so restless . 
The other is Professor Snape . 
He taught toxicology , but he did not want to teach the subject . 
Everyone knows he wants to take over Professor Quirrell's work . 
Horrified , horrible , Mr. Snape . 
Harry studied Snape for a moment , but he did not look back at Harry any more . 
Finally , the dessert is over . 
Professor Dumbledore stood up in the silent hall . 
- Ahem ! 
Just the words , now we have eaten full . 
I have some notes early in the year to send to the children . 
First year students know that the forest on the ground next to the school is a forbidden forest . 
Some high school students should also remember that . 
Speaking of that , Dumbledore's eyes steadyed at the Weasley twins , then continued : 
- I was also asked by Mr. Flich , the curator , to remind all students not to use magic outside the classroom , in the corridor . 
Quidditch matches will be held on the second of the semester . 
Anyone who wants to play for the team , contact Hooch . 
And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third floor corridor on the right hand side is the forbidden area . 
If one wants to die in an extremely painful way , then go on . 
Harry laughed , but there were only a few laughers like him . 
He whispers to Percy : 
- Are you serious ? 
Percy frowned at Dumbledore's instructions : 
- Yes , seriously ! 
It's a bit strange , because Dumbledore often states that we are not allowed to go somewhere . 
For example , do not go to the forest because of dangerous beasts . 
For this , he thought at least he should tell the leaders . 
Dumbledore said , 
- And now , before going to bed , we sing a school song together . 
Harry suddenly noticed that other professors smiled at him . 
Dumbledore waved his wand as if he were chasing the fly at the bottom of his stick . 
From the top of the cane a golden ribbon winds like a snake and forms the letters above the tables . 
Dumbledore said : 
- Each person chooses the appropriate tone for his voice . 
Do we started : 
And the whole school screams : 
Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hogwarts 
Please teach us something 
Although we are bald 
Young shoots with knee joints 
our head can cram ! 
Interesting things 
Because now we are naked and full of air 
Flies dead and less hairy 
Teach us what is worth knowing 
Return what we have forgotten 
Do your best 
The rest left us free 
And until the mind drifts . 
The song ends , the person ends first , the latter finishes . 
After all , only two Weasley twins were still in the neck with the rhythm of the chorus . 
When the two of them finished singing , Dumbledore raised his wand to recover the lyrics and clapped his hands , loudly clapping loudly . 
She wiped her eyes and said , 
- Oh ! 
Music . That is the magic that goes beyond any magic that we can do here . 
Go to bed . 
People go away for ! 
The first - year Gryffindor percy goes through the thunderstorms chatting , out of the hallway , onto a marble staircase . 
Harry's legs were as heavy as lead , but it was because he was tired and had a full stomach . 
It was too sleepy so it was no surprise that the footsteps hanging along the wall whistled as it passed . 
It also surprises me that Percy led the way through the door behind the large pictures and the carpets hanging on both walls . 
They climb up stairs again , just dragging a pair of yawns yawning . 
Harry was wondering how much longer he had to go , the whole group stopped suddenly . 
In front of them , a bunch of clubs are floating in the air . 
Percy took a step and the baton began to roll over him . 
Percy whispered to the first - graders : 
- Peeves - a goblin . 
Then Percy cried out : 
- Peeves , come out . 
There was only a harsh and loud sound , like a bubbly fuss , in response to Percy's threat : 
- Do you want me to see the bloody baron ? 
One of them , a little boy with dark eyes and mouth wide open . 
He crossed his legs and drifted along with the clubs . 
With a delicate voice , he smiled : 
- Wai , the new soldiers . 
Take care ! 
Suddenly he stammered the first bunch of students , causing the crowd to head down . 
Percy exclaimed , 
- Get out , Peeves , otherwise I ' ll be the baroness , I ' ll tell you the truth . 
Peeves stuck out his tongue and disappeared , releasing the sticks on Neville's head . 
The children heard him hovering around , shaking his armor when he left . 
They all went on , Percy advised : 
- You watch out for Peeves . 
The bloody baron is the only one who can control him , but the boss is not afraid of him . 
We have arrived here . 
At the end of the corridor there was a portrait of a fat woman dressed in pink silk . 
She asked : 
- Password ! 
Percy replies : 
- Caput Draconis . 
The portrait of himself squatting aside , revealing a round hole on the wall . 
All in , Neville needs to have a foot support to get through . 
So they entered Gryffindor's common room , a warm round room filled with soft couches . 
Percy took the girls through a door to their own bedroom , while the other girl went to another bedroom . 
Up the top of the top of the snail - perhaps one of the towering towers of the castle - the boys finally found a bed . 
Five posters hang together with red velvet membrane . 
Their chests were brought up . 
They are too tired to speak , just change clothes and sleep . 
Ron also stated : 
- good food ? 
Through the murmuring of Harry : 
- Avoid , Scabbers ! 
Heaven and earth chew your bedclothes ! 
Harry also wanted to ask if Ron had eaten the honey , but his eyes were closed and he fell asleep . 
Maybe Harry had eaten too much so it was a nightmare . 
He found himself wearing Quirrell's scarf . 
The towel just sucked it through the Slytherin right away , because it was destined . 
Harry told the towel he did not want to stay at Slytherin's house . 
The scar has become more and more heavy . 
He tried to throw away his scarf , but the towel was tightening more and more , making it blunt . 
And while he fumbled with the headband , Malfoy laughed out loudly . 
Then Malfoy transformed into a snappy nose professor - Snape , whose laughter grew louder and more sinister . 
A flash of blue light flashed and Harry woke up , trembling body , sweat . 
Harry curled up and sank back to sleep . 
When he woke up the next day , he did not remember the dream of the night . 
Chapter 08 : PHARMACEUTICAL PRESCRIPTION 
- that ! 
Look ! 
where ? 
- Next to that high red hair . 
- wearing glasses ? 
- See her face ? 
- See his scars ? 
Whispers whispered everywhere as Harry got out of the dorm the next day . 
The students stood outside the classroom , peering at Harry for a second , or turned around Harry's face again , looking at him steadily . 
Harry prayed that they should not do that again , because he needed to concentrate on getting his way to some classrooms . 
Up to one hundred and forty two stairs in Hogwarts . 
Large stairs , clean ball ; narrow stairs , cramped ; having a staircase up to the sixth day leads to a place different from normal days ; the stairs disappear halfway and people go there to know that jump . 
Again , there are wings of refusal to open , if not abusive , or do not hit the right point on the door . 
And there are doors that are not really doors , but just walls that look like doors . 
It is also difficult to remember the location of the objects , as they seem to be free to move around . 
Those who hang out in the wall to leave the frame that visit each other , and some armor warrior soldiers , Harry is sure they wander in the castle . 
Ghosts are not worth anything . 
Only good at making people jerk , especially when they are busy opening the door , they fluttered through . 
Only Nick had nearly lost his head was kind , always happy to point Gryffindor's new pupil in the right direction . 
Anyone who is unlucky to ask the Peeves goblin how he led him to two locked doors and a fake stairs . 
He pulled the trash on people's heads , pulled the rug at people's feet , fell to the ground , crashes , slammed his back , invisible , suddenly pinched his nose and screamed : 
- grab your nose nè ! 
But Peeves were not as bad as Flich's supervisor . 
Harry and Ron unluckily hit his head early in the morning . 
He caught two children trying to push a door , and unfortunately for them , that door turned out to be the entrance to a forbidden corridor on the third floor . 
He did not believe that the two children stray , insisting they were intent on breaking into the forbidden zone . 
He tried to lock up the two stools , fortunately , Professor Quirrell walked by and escaped . 
Mr. Flich had a cat named Mrs. Norris , a thin , hairy creature with a grayish feather , bulging like a bulb , just like Flich's . 
One alone , Mrs. Norris patrolled the corridors . 
Just as someone stuck a finger across the boundary , Mrs. Norris immediately ran to the supervisor of the Flich . 
Mr. Flich will appear immediately , breathless , within two seconds , as he knows more secret passages in the castle than anyone else ( perhaps only lost two Weasley twins ) , and the same Like every ghost here , you can appear suddenly , right in front of your nose . 
All students hate Mr. Flich , and every student wants to kick Norris for a play . 
And then , once you want to learn , there is enough to learn . 
Harry quickly realized that magic had a lot to do with it , not just scissors and mumbled laughs . 
At midnight every Wednesday , children must study the sky with telescopes , learn the names of the stars , and observe the motion of the planets . 
Three times a week they had to go to the glasshouse behind the castle to learn about herbs with a wily , boring witch called Sprout . They learn how to care for strange plants and fungus , find out what they are for . 
The most boring class is the magic class . This is the only class taught by a ghost . 
Prof . Binns was very old , even asleep in front of the teacher's booth , the next morning he woke up hurried to the classroom , leaving his body in the room . 
Professor Binns goes on preaching and preaching , the children write and write names and dates , and confuse the devil Emeric with the ugly Uric . 
The enchanted teacher , Professor Flitwick , is a tiny witch , standing on a pile of books looking through the teacher's desk . 
On the first session of this course , the professor begins by attending class . 
When he called Harry Potter , he hissed and flinched . 
Professor McGonagall is always different . 
Harry was perfectly right to think that it was not a good idea to be with her . 
Strict and intelligent , she persuaded her students to get one right at the first minute of the first session . 
She said : 
Transfiguration is one of the most dangerous and complex miracles that you will learn at Hogwarts . 
Anyone who breaks into class will be kicked out and never returned . 
I have already announced . 
Then she turned the teacher's table into a pig , and turned it back into a table . 
Get the baby excited as much and just want to start working immediately . 
But they soon realized that it took a long time to change from animal to animal . 
After recording so many confusing recipes , the children were given some matches to learn how to make matches . 
At the end of the session , only one person turned the match into a non - match , which was Hermione . 
The professor raised Hermione's stick to the class : it was silver and pointed at one end , and she had a rare smile on Hermione . 
The class that everyone is anxiously waiting for is the class against dark art . 
But Professor Quirrell's lectures turned out to be rather ridiculous . 
His class smelled of garlic . 
It is rumored that he used to drive away the vampires he had met in Romania , which he now feared would someday return . 
The professor told the children that his headband was a gift from an African prince to thank him for helping him out of a female goblin . 
Children do not believe it . 
For one thing , when Seamus eagerly asked how he had won the goblin , he blushed and spoke out over the weather . 
On the other hand , the children noticed that a very funny smell from the scarf on his head . 
The Weasley twins insisted that the towel was stuffed with garlic , and Professor Quirrell's team was to protect themselves anytime , anywhere . 
Harry lightly when he saw in the study that he was not too far away friends of his age . 
In the classroom there are many games that come from the Muggle world like it , when the school did not know anything about the witch . 
There are too many things to learn here , to the son of the son of Ron as well as run out of breath . 
That Friday was a big day for Harry and Ron : the first time they reached the big street for breakfast without getting lost . 
As he poured sugar into the bowl , Harry asked Ron : 
- What do we study today ? 
- Two drugs with Slytherin . 
Mr. Snape is the owner of the Slytherin House . 
I heard he was very biased . To see if this meal is true ? 
- Professor McGonagall also biased us ? 
Professor McGonagall is Gryffindor's principal , but not so she excuses them for a mountain - like exercise like yesterday . 
Just then , the mail arrived . 
Harry is now used to never receiving a letter . 
But remembering the first morning , it was shocking to see hundreds of owls in the middle of the hall , flying their soles on the tables , looking for their owners , dropping the envelopes and parcel . 
Up until now , Hedwig had not brought Harry a letter . 
At times it also flew into Harry's shoulders , but for a slight incision in his master's ear , get a piece of toast before flying off to sleep with the other owls in the school . 
However , this morning , Hedwig sank down between the sugar jar and jar to drop a letter on Harry's plate . 
Harry opened the letter immediately . 
The letter is written in the following zigzag lines : 
Dear Harry ! 
I do not know about Friday noon , so do you want to have a cup of tea with me at your hour ? 
I want to hear about your first week of school . 
Tell Hedwig to answer me . 
Hagrid 
Harry borrowed Ron's feathers , writing a few words on the back of the letter : 
- Yes , I'm very happy . 
See you later . 
Hedwig immediately brought the letter away . 
Luckily , Harry had a tea party with Hagrid to look forward to , and he was not bored with the poison study . 
The poison lesson that day was the worst memory ever seen in Harry's life . 
At the start of the party , Harry had only the impression that Professor Snape did not like him . 
But at the end of the first lesson he knew it was all wrong . 
Not Professor Snape disliked it , but he hated it . 
The poison class was studied in a cooler tunnel , much colder than the main rooms on the campus , which made the student's hair grow . There were also insects in the glass tubes , filled with four walls . 
Snape's teacher , like Flitwick , began his class on a roll call . 
And like Mr. Flitwick , he stopped by the name Harry Potter . 
- Ah , yes . 
Harry Potter . 
Our new illustrious name . 
His voice was gentle . 
Malfoy and his two friends , Crabbe and Goyle , covered their mouths with laughter . 
Snape looked up at the class . 
His eyes were as black as Hagrid's eyes , but they were not as warm as Hagrid's eyes . 
They are cold and empty , reminiscent of dark tunnels . 
Snape started : 
- They are here to study a subtle science and an accurate art of making drugs . 
His voice was not loud , but it was louder than a whisper , but the children listened without a word . 
Professor Snape is as talented as Professor McGonagall does not need to take the job but still keep the class silent as sheets . 
- Since they do not need to wiggle their wands so often , they often do not believe this is a form of magic . 
I did not expect them to really understand the beauty of the lightly lit cauldrons ; They do not expect what they understand the delicate power of the fluids in the blood vessels , fascinating people's minds , making the senses trapped . But we can teach them how to bottle up the name . cooking , cooking , glory , even death - if they are not a cow head that we still have to teach . 
After this little speech , the class became more quiet . 
Harry and Ron peeked at each other . 
Hermione was leaning forward , eager to prove she was not a bull . 
Suddenly Snape snapped : 
- Potter ! 
If we add the roots of the raindrops to the solution of wormwood , what will be ? 
Root of something into the solution of what ? 
Harry looked at Ron , but Ron was just like him . 
Hermione raised her hand . 
Harry replied : 
- I do not know . 
Snape's lips twisted in contempt : 
- Well , well , that's not to far ! 
He did not care for Hermione's raised hand . 
- Another sentence , Potter ! 
If I told you to find me a be zoar , where will you find me ? 
Hermione stretched out her arms to raise her high , not getting up to lift her up . 
But Harry did not have a slight idea of ​​ the so - called be - zoar . 
He looked at Malfoy , Crabbe and Goyle . 
They laughed to shiver . 
- I do not know . 
- Potter , do you think you can go to school without opening the book first ? 
Harry was forced to look directly at Snape's cold eyes . 
He read all the textbooks he had at Dudley's house , but did Snape ask for it to remember all the details of a thousand herbs and molds in magic ? 
Snape did not seem to see Hermione's trembling hands . 
- Potter , where are the priests hat and coyotes ? 
In this country , Hermione stood up , her high arm reaching for the ceiling . 
Harry quietly said : 
- I do not know . 
I think Hermione knew , why do not you try calling her ? 
A few laughs . 
Harry caught sight of Seamus . 
The boy winked . 
Snape looked annoyed . 
Hermione : 
- Sit down ! 
Turning to Potter , he continued : 
- Potter , this is a bit of knowledge for you : the sunflowers with wormwood form a powerful sleeping pill known to the name : the pain of death is alive . 
Be - zoar is a crushed gravel from the goat stomach , which can be used to treat most poisonous substances . 
Hats and tufts of wolves are one , also named father tree ? 
What are they waiting for , not to take notes ? 
So the rattle of a feathered bird running on a parchment was raised . 
Snape's voice resounded on that rusty background : 
- The Gryffindor House lost a point for your sake , Potter . 
From then on until the end of the toxicology session the situation was not up to the Gryffindor . 
Snape divided the children into pairs , assigning them to practice mixing a simple poison to cure boils . 
He walked over , swept the black shirt , saw the children weighing the dried nettle and crushed the snake , which he also crushed , except Malfoy , his favorite child in the face . 
He was telling the class to watch the way Malfoy stalked the new horny snail , the blue acid smoke rising like a cloud , then a loud thud sounded in the cellar : Neville did not know how . melted the cauldron of Seamus into a distorted , unknown name . The poison spreads to the stone floor , touching the sole of the shoe into a hole . 
The class rushed to the bench as Neville groaned in pain . 
It was hit by poison when the cauldron fell to the floor , the red pimples around my legs . 
Snape's teacher : 
- Goof . 
I'm sure you added porcelain feathers before the cauldron came out of the fire . 
He wiped the wand to clean up the poison . 
Neville frowns because a redhead begins to break right at the tip of his nose . 
Snape Seashell Snape : 
- take it to the clinic . 
Then he went around Ron and Harry . 
The two of us doing experiments next to Neville . 
- Mi , Potter , why do not you remind him not to remove the urchin hair ? 
You think it's wrong to make it look like you do not ? Lost another point for the Gryffindor . 
This was too unfair , Harry opened his mouth to protest , but Ron kicked it , whispering : 
- do not argue 
I heard Snape can become extremely cruel if he back up . 
An hour later , the class ended . 
Climbing up the stairs from the vault , Harry felt a confused mind and a heavy heart . 
Only in the first week had it lost two points for Gryffindor . 
How did Snape hate it ? 
Ron comforted : 
- do not be sad ! 
Mr. Snape also often points out his brother George and Fred . 
Did you go to Hagrid's house this afternoon ? 
Both out of the castle at three o ' clock , across the yard . 
Hagrid lived in a small wooden house across the forbidden forest . 
In front of the house there is a couch and a pair of rubber shoes . 
When Harry knocked on the door , the chirp sounded inside and the dog barked at the barks . 
Then Hagrid's voice rang out : 
- Back , Fang . 
Come back . 
Hagrid's large face and hair popped open behind the sound of a heavily tugged door . 
- Wait . 
Back , Fang . 
He clutched at the neck of a giant black hound , trying to keep it for the two children who entered the house . 
Inside only one chamber . 
Dried meat and pheasant hung on the ceiling , a copper kettle was boiling on the fire , and in the corner was a huge bed with a pile of blankets . 
Hagrid released Fang , saying : 
- It's just like living in your home . 
Fang is like his master , so aggressive and very friendly . 
He ran to Ron and started licking his ear . 
Harry introduced to Hagrid : 
- this is Ron . 
Hagrid poured boiling water into a large teapot , glancing at the freckles on Ron's face and said , 
- Another one of the Weasleys ? 
I have spent my life just to chase two brothers out of the forest . 
" Hagrid , " he said , offering a pair of hard ice cakes to the two of them . 
These buns are capable of breaking any of the teeth , but the two of them just have to do as well as they eat and tell each other about their first lessons . 
Fang snuggled up Harry's pillow and spit over his shirt . 
Both Harry and Ron were glad to hear Hagrid call his supervisor Flich the old man . 
- And that cat , Mrs. Norris , I was about to give Fang it a long time ago . 
You know ? 
Every time we go to school is the cat that follows us everywhere . 
It is impossible to escape it . 
Surely Flich told him to do it . 
Harry told Hagrid about his lesson with Snape . 
Hagrid , like Ron , hurts Harry , do not worry about it , Snape does not like any pupils , not Harry . 
- But he hated me . 
Hagrid dismissed : 
- Nonsense , bullshit ! 
What does he hate me for ? 
However , Harry could not help but realize that Hagrid avoided his eyes when saying that . 
Hagrid asked Ron , 
- What's your brother Charlie ? 
I like it very much . 
He trained the beasts very well . 
Harry did not know if Hagrid was deliberately talking about something else . 
While Ron told him about Charlie and his dragon research , Harry picked up a piece of paper lined under a teapot on the table . 
The newspaper was cut from the prophetic newspaper . 
THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT GRINGOTTS GRINDING 
Further investigations into the Gringotts bank intrusion on July 31 show that there is credible evidence that the black witches were involved . 
The goblins in Gringotts claim that nothing is lost . 
The basement ransacked was actually cleared before , the same day . 
A goblin spokesman said this afternoon . 
But we will not say anything , please do not put your nose in the work here . 
Harry remembered when on the train , Ron said someone was planning to rob the Gringotts bank , but did not say on the day . 
- Uncle Hagrid ! 
Gringotts bank robbery happened on the birthday of the child . 
It happened at the time we were there ! 
This time no doubt , Hagrid dodged Harry's gaze . 
He grumbled and offered him another stone cake . 
Harry reread the message : the ransacked tunnel was actually cleared before , the same day . 
Then it was Hagrid who had emptyed the seven hundred and thirteen tunnels that day , if the call to action to get that dusty packet was empty . 
Is that the package that the bandits want to find ? 
When Harry and Ron returned to the castle to have dinner , their pockets filled with young stone cakes that Hagrid had favored , and were too polite to deny them . 
Harry thought no lesson that made him think much about tea with Hagrid . 
Did Hagrid get the package in time ? 
Now where is the package ? 
And did Hagrid know anything about Snape , whom he did not want Harry to know ? 
CHAPTER 09 : THE DAY OF THE NIGHT 
Previously , Harry thought that there would be no more haters than Dudley , until he met Draco Malfoy . 
At first , however , the Gryffindor first - year students only had to study with Slytherin students on each drug , so Harry did not touch much with Malfoy . 
Hya at least had nothing to do with it , until the announcement in the Gryffindor meeting room made everyone cry : Flight lessons will start on Thursday - and the Gryffindor will learn with the Slytherins . 
Harry was sad : 
- Why clever arrangement ! 
I will be turned into a guy in front of Malfoy to see it ! 
But in the past Harry was eager , looking forward to learning Bay than any other . 
And now 
Ron comforted it : 
- do not think so foolishly ! 
Malfoy always boasted that he was good at Quidditch . 
But I know he's only good at speaking ! 
Malfoy , it must be very Bay . 
He always talks about flying . 
It's been a great deal of complains that this school never recruited Quidditch football's first - year student , and told stories of fabrication , ending with a narrow escape . Muggles ( chased by magicians ) chased by helicopters . 
Let's just say , Malfoy is not the only one to brag . Seamus also often said that he was still in the countryside on the broom . 
Even Ron was willing to tell anyone that he nearly hit a roller coaster when he was flying over Charlie's old broom . 
Witches are the most talked about Quidditch game . 
Ron bickering with Dean , roommate , about football . 
Ron said he did not see anything funny or that the game had only one ball and that the player was not allowed to fly off the face 
land . 
Once Harry found out that Ron was picking a stick at the West Ham football pitch , it seemed he was trying to make the players fly . 
Neville , for all his life , had never been on a broomstick , because she had no way of letting him go near a witch's broom . 
Harry found that such a prohibition was perfectly reasonable , because Neville was barefoot and always had an accident to the accident , not to mention flying to his feet . 
Hermione was eager to learn to fly like Neville . This is not a memoir that can be memorized first , but Hermione is still reading the book first . 
At breakfast on Thursday , she made everyone upset when quoting enough flight tips that she read from a book borrowed from a library called Quidditch through the ages . 
Only Neville is swallowing her every word , it is earnest with anything that can help it later wear broomsticks . 
So everyone was happy when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by letters . 
Besides Hagrid's previous letter , Harry did not receive any more . Of course , Malfoy was aware of this . 
When her eagle brought candy wrappers from the house she was eagerly dressing up the Slytherin table . 
That day , Neville's owl gave her a small present . 
The boy opened the package : a large glass ball with large balls , smoke inside . 
Neville explained : 
- This is the sphere of Remembrance . 
She knew she had forgotten she sent her . 
This will remind you of what you forgot . Hey , just hold on tight like this , if it turns red ! 
Neville's face is bewildered , because the ball is turning purple : 
- I have something to forget about it 
Neville is trying to remember what he has forgotten , and Draco Malfoy walks past Gryffindor's table and grabs Neville's Memory Stick . 
Harry and Ron stood up . Both are waiting for a chance to give Malfoy a game . 
But then Professor McGonagall , who discovered the problem faster than all the other teachers , was present at a glance . 
- What is happening ? 
" Miss Malfoy , " said Miss Malfoy , losing his memory . 
Malfoy scowled and dropped the ball . 
- I just watch it . 
Then he left , Crebbe and Goyle huddled behind . 
That afternoon , around three and a half hours , Harry , Ron , and the other Gryffindors hurried down to learn the first grade . 
The day was clear , the wind was light , the grass wandered as they passed the yard to the grass opposite the forbidden forest . 
The tree swinging in the dark forest hiding in the distance . 
Young children of the Slytherin have enough . 
They were prepared on the ground twenty broomsticks in neat rows . 
Harry heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school's broomsticks , that some trees were shaking when they were flying so high , and some of them rolled to the left . 
Flight student , Ms . Hooch , arrived . 
She has gray hair , short , and golden eyes like eagle eyes . 
General : 
- What are you waiting for ? 
Each game comes next to a broom , hurry up ! 
Harry glanced down at the broom next to his feet , seeing how jagged , old it was . 
Hooch stood in front : 
- Right hand on the broom and shout : UP . 
People scream loudly : 
- UP . 
Harry's broom immediately jumped into it . 
In class , only a few seconds to do so . Hermione's broom just rolled over the ground , and Neville's broom did not budge . 
Harry thought , maybe the brooms were like horses , they knew when people were scared . 
Need to hear the voice of Neville's trembling , broom handle also know that Neville absolutely did not dare to open his legs . 
Mrs Hooch was only able to climb the brush without falling off . 
She went over to correct the students . 
Harry and Ron enjoyed the excitement of hearing Hooch scold Malfoy for years to learn what to do . 
- Now , when I blow the whistle , the bouncing feet on the ground . 
Grasp the broom handle , fly up a meter , then lower it by leaning forward a bit . note the whistle . 
Three two 
Neville , fearful of falling behind , hurried to pick up the momentum ahead of Hooch's whistle . 
Ms . Hooch : 
- Back , that game ! 
But Neville fired up like a bottle of wine bouncing off . 
It flew up to a meter and three meters . 
Harry saw Neville's faint white face on the ground drifting backwards . 
Neville gasped , slipping off his broom , and 
LEFT ! ! ! 
He fell to the ground a thud , accompanied by the broken teeth , sprinkled in a pile , face on the grass . 
Its broom still flies high and high , and begins to drift lazy toward the forbidden forest , and finally disappears . 
Hooch leaned over Neville , her face as white as his face . 
Harry heard her mutter : 
- wrist fracture 
Come on , son . 
No problem , sit up and see . 
She returned to the class : 
- While I was giving this game to the infirmary , nobody was moving . Put the brush down , otherwise it will be kicked out of Hogwarts before talking about Quidditch or something else . 
Come on , son , get up . 
Neville , with tears in his eyes , hugged his wrist , and roared with Hooch . 
She wrapped her arms around Neville's shoulder to help him out . 
Both Malfoy laughed : 
- Do we see that idiot face ? 
The other Slytherins laughed and responded . 
Parvati Patil : 
- Shut up , Malfoy ! 
A sickly Slytherin child whistling : 
- Reason ? 
Is that Parvati Mongolian disease ? 
You did not expect that kid to cry , Parvati ! 
Malfoy cried out : 
- Look ! 
Then he leaned forward , raising his hand to capture something on the grass . 
- Well , that Mongolian girl sent him this ! 
The Remaining Globe is in Malfoy's hands , gleaming in the sunlight . 
Harry calmly said : 
- take it here , Malfoy ! 
People stopped talking to watch . 
Malfoy grinned : 
- Let me think about where to find the Mongolian easy to find . 
Is there another tree ? 
Harry screamed : 
- give it here ! 
But Malfoy jumped on his broomstick and soared . 
Turns out it does not speak , it knows how to fly . 
Climbing over the tall tree , he called down : 
- Get up here , Potter ! 
Harry grabbed the brush . 
Cried Hermione . 
- do not ! 
Hooch had told her not to leave . 
You made us suffer from this ! 
Harry ignored her words . 
The hot blood rushed over his head , he clambered up his broomstick , kicked hard on the ground , and shot up into the air . 
The wind swept through his hair , exaggerating his long coat , and flung it backwards ; and a joy filled in Harry's heart when he realized there were things he did not need to do . 
It seems easy to fly , and it's great . 
He pulled the broom handle up a bit to fly higher , hear the screaming screams of the girls on the ground , Ron's admirable screams . 
Harry swings his broomstick to Malfoy , facing Malfoy in the air . 
Malfoy's face tightened . 
Harry said : 
- give it here . 
If I do not , I ' ll punch you out of the brush . 
- Maybe no ? 
Malfoy tried to keep his voice mocking , but it looked worried . 
Harry knew what to do . 
He leaned in and gripped the brush with both hands , pointing straight at Malfoy as a lance . 
Malfoy just shy away in a snap . 
Harry turned around immediately and held the broom firmly . 
Under the ground , clapping fence . 
Harry yelled : 
- There is no Crabbe , Goyle to save you ! 
Maybe Malfoy just thought of that , so his face was gone . 
She shouted : 
- Pay for it , try it ! 
He threw the ball into the sky and hurried down to the ground . 
Harry looked at the globe . Like a slow - motion film , it soared to the sky and began to fall down . 
All this only happened in the blink of an eye : he leaned forward , broomed the broom , took the momentum to run down the speed to race with the falling ball . 
The wind whistled through the ears , and the horrible screams of the people on the ground looked up . 
When the glass sphere was only three inches from the ground , Harry reached for his hand . 
Just in time to pull it straight broom handle , lightly landed on the grass with the ball to Remember memory in hand . 
- HARRY POTTER ! 
Harry's heart throbbed even faster as he plunged down the globe . 
Professor McGonagall rushed forward . 
Harry's feet were so shaky that he stood unsteady . 
- All my life at Hogwarts was never 
Professor McGonagall was so utterly speechless . 
Her eyes grew furiously : 
- Why do you dare anyone to break the neck as you play 
- No , it's not your fault 
- I do not ask , Parvati ! 
" Yes , but in Malfoy . " 
- Enough , Weasley ! 
Potter , follow me . 
Harry glanced at Malfoy , Crabbe's and Goyle's triumphal triumphs , then returned to Professor McGonagall's path to the castle . 
He was sure he would be expelled . 
She wanted to say something to defend herself , but it seemed that her voice was doing the same . 
Professor McGonagall chided a look without looking at Harry once . 
It must be both running and running . 
It's done . 
He had just been in Hogwarts for less than two weeks , and then had to pack away for ten minutes . 
How did you eat with your Uncle Dursley when you came back ? 
She swung around with Professor McGonagall climbing the steps , stepping into the castle , waiting to hear the professor say a word to him . 
She furiously opened the door to the corridor , Harry again miserably following . 
Maybe she brought him to see Dumbledore . 
Harry was thinking of Hagrid , but he was also expelled , but was held captive . 
May he be an assistant to Hagrid . 
It was cramped when he imagined the life of Hagrid's life around the school grounds , while Ron and the others became the great sorcerers . 
Professor McGonagall stopped in front of a classroom . 
She opened the door and poked her head in . 
- Sorry Professor Flitwick , please lend me a little Wood . 
Wood ? 
What ? 
Harry thought , bewildered . 
It is borrowed by borrower Professor McGonagall to fine it ? 
Turns out , Wood is a human , a healthy fifth - grader . 
He stepped out of the classroom with a puzzled expression . 
Professor McGonagall said : 
- Both follow me . 
As they walked along the corridor , Wood curiously looked at Harry . 
- Come in ! 
Professor McGonagall points to an empty classroom . 
In the room , only the Peeves were pounding on the table . 
Professors : 
- Peeves , go out . 
Peeves threw the chalk in the trash , just flew out of the room and grunted . 
Professor McGonagall closed the door of the room and turned to look at the two pupils : 
- Potter , this is Oliver Wood . 
Wood , she discovered a player . 
Wood's bewildered expression suddenly became radiant . 
- Damn you ? 
Professor McGonagall laughed brightly : 
- Completely . 
This kid is an innate scout . 
She has never seen anyone like it . Is this the first time you've been riding a broom ? 
Harry nodded quietly . 
It does not quite understand what the other two are saying , but it seems that it will not be expelled . 
So the boy's legs began to feel back . 
Professor McGonagall told Wood : 
- It plummets down from the height of sixteen meters , captures the globe , so without any scratches . Charlie Weasley did not do that either . 
Wood's expression blossomed as if his dream had come true . 
He asked Harry , 
- Have you ever seen Quidditch , Potter ? 
Professor McGonagall explains : 
- Wood is the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team . 
Wood walks around Harry staring and says : 
- Harry was born to be Savage . 
Gentleman , we must give Harry a broom . 
You suggested a Nimbus 2000 or a Cleansweep 7 , okay ? 
- She will talk to Professor Dumbledore to see if we can break the first year enrollment criteria . 
God , we need a stronger team than last year ! 
I lost Slytherin in that battle , I did not face any face Snape looked at him for several weeks . 
Then Professor McGonagall poked his glasses through to look at Harry , sternly saying : 
" You want me to practice diligently , Potter , or else you ' ll change your mind to a heavier one ! " 
Then she smiled and said , 
- Three children but he is sure he is alive . 
The three of us are also a great Quidditch player . 
Dinner time . 
Harry ate and told Ron what had happened when he followed Professor McGonagall into the castle . 
- You talk to me ? 
Ron was biting a piece of beef and croissant , forgetting to chew on the meat when he heard that Harry had been chosen as the Hammer . 
- Tackle ? But the first year students will not be one of the youngest player since 
- a century . " Harry just loosened his mouth and answered Ron , " Wood said to himself . 
He felt hungry after the thrill of the evening . 
Ron was so surprised and so admirable that he just sat there and gasped at Harry . 
- I will start training next week . 
But do not tell anyone ! 
Wood wants to keep the secret . 
At that moment , Fred and George walked into the dining room . 
When they saw Harry , they rushed forward . 
- Very good ! 
George whispered into Harry's ear : 
- Mr. Wood told us you know . 
We are also in the football team - We are the Gunners . 
Fred said , 
- You tell me , sure this year we will win the Quidditch Cup . 
Since Charlie's graduation , we lost the championship , but this year our team is bright . 
You have to play well for Harry . 
Wood lacked the leap to report this to us or to believe he was recruited . 
George says : 
- Well , we have to go . 
Lee Jordan said it had just discovered a secret path out of the school . 
Fred said : 
" I dare to say that it was the road behind Gregory Kha Aui's wall that we had just opened in the first week of school . 
Well , hen meet again after home ! 
Fred and George go out to hide the hard - hitting crowd : Malfoy with Crabbe and Goyle . 
- The last cup , Potter ? 
As long as you have to board the train back to Muggle ? 
Cool Harry replied 
- You look so much brave ! 
Down to earth , there are some little lunatic side . 
Of course , Crabbe and Goyle are not small , but they do not sound very harsh . 
But because at the high table there were professors sitting , the little boys hummed and dared to do nothing but kneel up and crack their fingers . 
Malfoy challenges : 
- Already ! 
You dare to fight with me , any time . tonight also . duel type witch , using only wand , not wax leaves . 
Star ? Have not you ever heard of a duelist ? 
Ron added : 
- Harry knew why not ! 
Tao is its duplicate . 
Who is your twin ? 
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle estimated who should choose which one , then decided : 
- Hey Crabbe , midnight is not you ? Already ! Meeting in the traditional room , the room is never locked . 
When Malfoy left , Ron and Harry looked at each other . 
Finally , Harry asked , 
- What is a witch - type duel ? 
What is the second ? 
- Well , you are the one who will replace you in case you are killed . 
Ron's tone was calm , and he began to eat dessert . 
Seeing Harry's bewilderment , Ron rushes forward : 
- But the fight really died , at that moment there is real magic witchcraft . 
And you Malfoy guy is not too head is not the same thing . 
You with it , there are children who are allowed to hurt each other but worry ! 
I bet it is challenging for you to refuse , to lose face play . 
- But if I raise my wand and can not get any miracles ? 
- Then threw his wand and ran it . 
Suddenly a voice : 
- Sorry . 
Both raised their heads . 
Turns out Hermione . 
Ron annoyed : 
- Would not you like to eat and drink ? 
- I overheard some friends with Malfoy 
- Who caught you listening ! - Ron muttered . 
" You know , you guys should not be wandering in school at night . 
You think the Gryffindor will be deducted if you are arrested ! 
How could you be arrested ? 
You should not just know yourself like that ! 
- This is nothing to do with you . 
Harry replied and Ron added : 
- Well , hi . 
Always is , no day is no matter to worry . 
Harry lies awake and thinking while Dean and Seamus snore o o . ( Neville is still not in the clinic . ) Ron spent the night trying to advise Harry : 
- If it curses you , then you are the best , because I do not remember much curse . 
This is a great opportunity for Filch or his cat - Mrs Norris - to catch the two . 
Harry felt like he was making a daring move , daring to violate another school rule today . 
But to think of Malfoy's perverse face in the dark , it was more exhilarating - it was a unique opportunity for him to fight Malfoy for each other . 
Such an opportunity Harry finds it hard to ignore . 
- Ten and a half hours . 
We are going to fit . 
Ron whispered to Harry . 
They put on their clothes , took the wand and crawled through the upper tower , down the stairs , into Gryffindor's living room . 
In the fireplace , some of the charcoal remains , making the armchairs look like lumps of black . 
Two children are coming to the door behind the portrait , suddenly a voice from the nearest armchair : 
- I did not expect you two to do that , Harry ! 
A flashing oil lamp . that is Hermione - frowning frowning , in a pink nightgown . 
Ron said , 
- You ! go to sleep ! 
Hermione snapped : 
- I'm telling you your name already ! 
Brother Percy , the photo is the leader , how the photo also prevent this . 
Harry could not believe there was such a person in the world . 
He told Ron : 
- go ! 
Harry pushed Mrs. Beo's portrait to one side and then through the hole , out . 
Hermione is not easy to give up . 
She also followed , hissing behind Ron like a mad goose : 
- You do not know what to think about Gryffindor's honor . 
You know only me . 
I do not want the Slytherin to win the Cup . 
My job was to answer the mantras in Professor McGonagall's hour , to get points for the Gryffindor house that some of you lost . 
- go away ! 
- It is OK . 
But I forewarned , as if tomorrow you have to board the train to try to remember what I said . 
But they did not expect the situation to return to this : when Hermione returned her portrait of Mrs. Be back to the bedroom , the picture was empty . 
Mrs. Beo was out for the night and Hermione was locked outside the Gryffindor Tower . 
She shrugged : 
- Now how do I know ? 
Said Ron : 
- it is your job . 
We have to go here , late . 
They reached the end of the corridor when Hermione followed . 
She said : 
- I go with you . 
- Can not . 
- Do you want me to wait here for Mr. Filch to arrest me ? If you catch all three then I will declare that I tried to stop you , then remember me ! 
Shouted Ron : 
- You're crazy 
Harry interrupts : 
- Both of you go . 
I heard a voice ! 
Something sounds like a snort . 
Ron thrilled , looking at the shadow : 
- Mrs. Norris ? 
Not Mrs. Norris , but Neville . 
It was curled up on the floor , falling asleep , suddenly jerks when the other three crawled . 
- Oh , good luck , you look for me ? 
I've been out for an hour . 
I can not remember the password to enter the bedroom . 
- Speak small Neville . 
The password is Pork muff , but now there is no password to do anything , Mrs. Beo has gone nowhere . 
- What's your hand ? Asked Harry . 
- Fine . Neville said , pointing to the kids , " Mrs. Pomfrey binds her for a minute . 
- Well , Neville , this one has a bit of a go . 
And see you later ! 
- do not leave me alone here . " Neville just croaked up - I do not want to be here alone . 
Baron Bloody go through this place twice already . 
Ron glanced at his watch and looked at Hermione and Neville : 
- If you two make us arrest , we will not be forgiven . 
I will learn the Bogies Curse that Professor Quirrell once said to curse them now . 
Hermione opened her mouth , probably going to read to Ron exactly how to use the Boggies Curse , but Harry had silenced her , and led the party away . 
They nestled close to the walls of the moonlight passing through the door and illuminated each strip , and sneakily walked along the corridor . 
Every time he turns around , Harry bumps into his head 
Mr. Filch or Mrs. Norris ; But for all of them , they did not meet anyone . 
The children climbed the stairs to the third floor and headed for the traditional room . 
Malfoy and Crabbe were not there . 
Crystal cupcovers lined the moon . 
The trophies , shields , spears , armor , forks , gold , silver glitter in the dark . 
The children ran along the wall , watching the door at the two ends . 
Harry held the wand , in case the Malfoy jumped out suddenly . 
Time is slow . 
Ron whispered : 
- it's late . 
Watch out for it ? 
Suddenly a sound was heard in the next room , which made them scream . 
Harry raised his wand as he heard the voice . 
But it was not Malfoy's voice : 
- sniff around , baby , they ' ll be in a corner ! 
It was Mr Filch's voice to Mrs Norris . 
Terribly horrified , Harry waved like crazy , motioned the other three to hurry . 
They ran smoothly toward the door without Filch's voice . 
Neville's shirt just out of corner , Mr. Filch into the Traditional room . 
Harry whispered to the other : This way ! . 
The souls crawling along a long gallery , filled with armor . 
Filch's voice echoed closer and closer . 
Neville screeched and panicked . 
He slipped , his legs hunched on Ron's waist and they both fell into a suit of armor . 
The metal clanged loud enough to awaken the castle . 
RUN ! Harry screamed , and the four of them closed their eyes and ran out of the gallery , not daring to see if Filch had chased them . 
They kept running , turning over the door , running down the corridor , Harry leading , no matter where he was , or where he was going . 
They came out behind a wall mat and found themselves standing in front of a secret passage . 
The way that goes to the room to study delusion , the room is quite traditional distance , miles . 
Harry leaned back against the cold wall , sweating his forehead , panting : 
- You gotta get out of here . 
Neville rolled his eyes , wheezing , puffing . 
Hermione panted , hugging her chest : 
- I told you 
Said Ron : 
- We must return to Gryffindor Tower , as quickly as possible . 
Hermione said to Harry : 
- Malfoy it trick you ! 
Do you see ? 
It did not come to the appointment . 
Sure , it shot Filch so he knew there were people in the room . 
Harry thought Hermione was right , but he did not admit it to her . 
- Well , come on ! - it says . 
But things are not so easy . 
They had just walked a few steps , the door knob suddenly shook , then something dive into the room , right in front of them . 
that's Peeves . 
He glanced at the group , showing extreme pleasure , then laughed . 
- Please shut up Peeves . 
You made us expelled ! 
Peeves chuckled : 
- In the middle of the night , wandering , new soldiers ? 
Rub rub rub , stir too , stirring up sound ! 
We were arrested for that ! 
- Please , if you do not sell this guy we will not be arrested . 
Peeves in his holy voice , but his glittering eyes : 
- Tell Filch not to . 
Must be reported . That is working well for them now , do you know ? 
Ron : 
- Stay away ! 
It pushes Peeves out , and this is a terrible mistake . 
Peeves roared : 
- CHINESE STUDENTS ! HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY STUDENTS ! 
Through the Peeves ' arms , all four of them running the net , straight to the end of the corridor , crashed into a door . 
Door lock . 
They pushed the door desperately . 
Ron whined : 
- Okay . 
We are out of the way . 
It's done ! 
From here , they could hear Filch's footsteps running fast toward the sound of the Peeves . 
- Avoid a party ! - Hermione huffed . 
He wrenched Harry's wand , knocking on the lock , whispering : Alohomora . 
Instantly the door opened , the door opened . 
They kneeled down , collapsed , then pressed their ear to listen . 
Across the door , they hear Filch ask Peeves : 
- Which way are they , Peeves ? 
Tell me to hurry up . 
- You must say please , Peeves ! . 
- do not pull it off , Peeves ! 
Say where , where are they ? 
The sound of the peeves humming sounded bloody : 
- Do not say please do not reply ! 
- Well , please . 
- Ha ha ha ! ! ! 
Do not say . I told you not to answer if you did not say so . 
Ha ha haaaa ! ! ! 
We all heard the Peeves flying through , followed by the furious Friar teacher . 
By this door , Harry whispered : 
- He thought this door locked . 
Let's get out of here Let's go , Neville ! 
Until then , Neville still grasped Harry's sleeve . 
It stammered : 
- What is that ? 
Harry turned around and saw clearly what the leaves were . 
In that moment , he was convinced that he was in a nightmare . 
Compared to all that has happened , this is the most horrible thing : All of them are now in the corridor , not a room as they think . 
And this is the ban on the third floor . 
Now they know why the corridor is forbidden . 
In front of four children is a monster dog , the body filling the space from floor to ceiling . 
It had three heads , three crazy eyes , long , striped eyes , three pointed noses in three directions , three snouts of sharp teeth , drooling from yellow fangs . 
It stood still , the six eyes glared at the kids , and Harry guessed the only reason they were not over was because the monster was completely surprised by the appearance of the kids . 
But the sudden moment passed quickly , the monster growls growling like a thundercloud , and everyone understands what that snarling means . 
Harry straightened the doorknob . 
Between Filch and death , it is better to choose Filch . 
They knocked on the door and Harry shut the door behind him . 
The four of them ran back up the hallway . 
Filch would have been busy finding them elsewhere , because he did not see the teacher . 
But none of them have the soul to see where he is . 
At this point , they just want to run as far away from the monster as possible . 
And they kept running until they faced Mrs. Beo's portrait on the seventh floor . 
Madam 
Stunned to see them : Sleeveless tops , sweat swollen , facial expression lost , sharp breath panting gasp . 
- Where are the children ? 
- You do not care . 
Snout 
Snout - Harry pantively read the password . 
The picture of Mrs. Beo was out and the children squeezed into each other , trembling , rolling into the couches . 
It took a while for them to open their mouths . Neville , indeed , looks like he's lost . 
Ron opened his mouth first : 
- Do not know what they think to leave a monster in school . 
That dog is too bloated , must go for exercise . 
Hermione has regained her breath and her temper . 
It's harsh : 
- You do not have eyes ? 
Did the dog stand on something ? 
- It's standing on the floor ! " At that point , " said Harry , " who was watching his feet , I was still worried about his head . 
- Are not ! 
It does not stand on the floor . 
It stands on a trapdoor . 
Obviously , it is guarding something . 
She stood up , cursing all three boys . 
- Are you satisfied ? 
I almost died . 
May not be expelled , it's bad ! 
Now , please excuse me , I'm going to bed now . 
Ron looked up at her , his mouth open : 
- It was like I was pulling it the wrong way ! 
However , Hermione's words made Harry sleep deprived . 
He thought about it , the dog was watching over what Hagrid had said : Gringoots was the safest place in the world - aside from Hogwarts - to store what he wanted . 
And it was as if Harry had found a place to hide the dusty package of paper from the seventeenth and thirteenth cellar . 
Chapter 10 : THE HALLOWEEN FESTIVAL 
Malfoy could not believe his eyes the next morning , seeing Harry and Ron in the Hogwarts yard , looking a little listless but full of excitement . 
Honestly , in the morning , when both Harry and Ron alluded to the encounter with the monster three nights last night was a very exciting adventure , so that two children set off on a adventure . save other . 
Harry also told Ron about the packet apparently taken from Gringotts to Hogwarts . 
How much time do you spend just to wonder why that package needs so much protection ? 
Ron thought : 
Either it is precious or it is very dangerous . 
Harry reasoned : 
- Maybe it is both precious and dangerous . 
They only know that one secret package is only half a foot long , and there is no evidence to suggest this . 
Neville and Hermione both did not care about what was in the trap , at the foot of the monster . What Neville is most concerned about now is to stay away from the monster as far away as possible . 
Hermione did not even talk to Ron and Harry after that . 
But because Hermione likes to make a lot of sense , so with Ron and Harry , do not talk like that again . 
Now we just hope there is a way to retaliate Malfoy . 
And how happy they are when the opportunity arrives in the mail delivery about a week later . 
As always , the flute hits the hall . 
This time , everyone paid special attention to a long parcel , needing six new to carry . 
Like everyone , Harry was eager to know what was inside the package , and it was amazing how the owls dropped the parcel right in front of him . 
When the other flight was over , another owl flew down , dropping a letter , right on the parcel . 
Harry hurriedly opened the letter . 
Fortunately it did so , because the letter writes : 
OPEN THE POSTS IN THE TABLE 
Including the brand new baby Nimbus 2000 , but she did not want people to know that I have a broom god , so that all hose to a tree . 
Oliver Wood will meet at Quidditch Stadium 7 pm tonight to start the first training session . 
Professor McGonagall . 
Harry hardly restrained the pleasure of giving the letter to Ron . 
Ron moaned enviously : 
- Can Nimbus 2000 ! 
I have not been touched yet 
Too eager to open the package see the broom god before entering the classroom , two children rushed out of the Hall . 
But just walking down the hallway , they hit Crabbe and 
Goyle stopped at the stairs . 
Malfoy snatches the package in Harry's hand . 
It says : 
- A broom ! 
Then threw it back to Harry , unable to hide his jealousy and discomfort : 
- This time you go to Potter , first - year students are not allowed to own brooms . 
Ron can not help it . 
It says : 
- this is not a blunt broom , this is the Nimbus 2000 ! What is your house at Malfoy ? 
What about a Comet 260 ? 
Ron grinned at Harry : 
- Comet looks sleek , but how do you get with Nimbus 2000 ? 
Malfoy shouted at Ron : 
- What do you know ? 
Your face can not buy half the broomstick , but do not say this effect . 
You guys with my brother must make sure to squeeze every penny , every penny ! 
Ron did not respond , and Professor Flitwick appeared next to Malfoy . 
He whispered through his teeth : 
- quarrel about something ? 
Malfoy : 
" Sir , someone sent Harry a broom ! 
- Ah , well , that's right . 
" Professor Flitwick smiled at Harry . 
- Professor McGonagall told me about this special case , Potter . What's the name ? 
- Teacher , Nimbus 2000 . 
Harry tried to keep his grin on Malfoy's face . 
It added : 
- And really , thanks to Malfoy , you got this new broom . 
Ron and Harry went up the stairs , laughing and falling back and forth knowing Malfoy was mad at jealousy . 
Up the marble steps , Harry smiled : 
- right . 
If it does not rob the ball of Neville's Memories , then I do not have the opportunity to be recruited into the team ? 
Suddenly a sarcastic voice came from behind : 
- So that turned out to be a reward for breaking the rules ? 
It turned out that Hermione was going up the stairs . 
Harry tease : 
- I thought you did not talk to us anymore ? 
Ron added : 
- Just do not say it again . 
That's good for both parties . 
Hermione walked away with a nose to the sky . 
That day Harry was hardly able to concentrate his mind on his lesson . 
At that time , his mind wandered in the bedroom , where the new broom lay under the bed ; At times its soul wanders off the pitch , where it will learn to play Quidditch tonight . 
She eats dinner fast without noticing what she eats . 
Then he ran to his bedroom with three legs and four feet to admire the Nimbus 2000 tree . 
- Well . 
Ron brushed open as the broom was opened , shining brightly on Harry's bed . 
Even Harry , who does not quite distinguish the brushes , still finds the Nimbus 2000 great . 
Glittering brushes , rattan handles , neat brushes , golden Nimbus 2000 letters near the end of the tail . 
Nearly seven hours , Harry left the castle to go to Quidditch Stadium . 
Previously , it never set foot in the field . 
The stands surround for hundreds of seats high enough for spectators to watch the match take place in the air . 
At the top of the courtyard there are three golden pillars , with columns in the top . 
The pillars reminded Harry of the glue bubbles that Muggle children often play . 
Only these pillars are sixteen meters high . 
While waiting for Wood , Harry anxiously wanted to fly too , so he climbed up the broom and stomped down to the ground . 
With one , it flew up . 
What a wonderful feeling . 
It hovered around the pillar of golf , accelerated , and then flew down the yard . 
Just touch a broom that can turn any direction that Harry wants . 
- Hey , Potter . 
Come down here ! 
Oliver Wood has come . 
He brought a large wooden crate . 
Harry landed next to Wood . 
Wood eyes steamed : 
- Very good . 
Professor McGonagall said the results were not wrong . 
You are a born Quidditch player . 
Tonight I just need to guide you to the rules , then I start training with the team , three times a week . 
Wood opened the box , inside four different sized balls . 
He explained : 
- This way , Quidditch rules are easy to understand although playing is not easy . 
There are seven players on each side , three of whom are called Truyen . 
- Trace . 
Harry repeated as Wood pulled out a large red ball of football skin . 
I said : 
- This ball is called Quaffle . 
The players will throw the ball for each other , so that it goes through the rings to get points . 
Every time Quaffle ball through the round is ten points . 
Keep up ? 
Harry repeated : 
- Chaffin throws Quaffle to each other and takes it round to get points . 
Then it's roughly like playing basketball on the broomstick , but there are six nets , right ? 
Wood asked curiously : 
- What is basketball ? 
Harry said , 
- Oh , forget it ! 
- Now , each side has a player called a captain . 
He is Gryffindor's captain . 
You have to fly around the rings of your team to prevent the opponent from scoring . 
Harry resolved to remember all : 
- Three Scouts , a captain . 
Playing with Quaffle . 
Understood . 
What are these for ? 
Harry just left the ball . 
Wood said : 
- I will guide you . 
Hold this . 
Wood gave Harry a bat , a bit like a baseball bat . 
- Now show me how to play Bludger . 
The two balls are Bludger . 
Those are two black balls and slightly smaller than the Quaffle . 
Harry noticed that they kept clicking and jumping out of the box . 
Wood tells Harry : 
- stand back ! 
He bent down and released a Bludger . 
Immediately , the black ball flew high and aimed directly at Harry's face . 
Harry had to use his baton to get it out of his nose , and run the zigzag just to dodge the ball . 
The balls are spinning over their heads and then darting straight into their faces 
Wood . 
He snapped the ball and tried to capture it again . 
Just struggling with the ball to stuff it into the box , he said : 
- Look to understand ? 
Bludger balls will move around the players , trying to knock them out of the broom . 
So each team needs two players . 
The Weasley twins are attacking their home team , Gryffindor . 
Their job is to protect the home team from being attacked by Bludger , then how they turn to attack the opponent team . 
Do you understand ? 
- Three Traders find a way to score points by the Quaffle ball , the defender of golf , the player chased the Bludger out of his team . 
- Very good . 
Harry looked inquisitive , asking : 
- Ừm Any time now , have anyone died of Bludger ball ? 
- Not at Hogwarts . 
Some people have jaw dropping , but none of them is heavier . 
Already ! Now comes the last player in a Quidditch team . 
Players . that's me . 
You will not need to pay attention to Quaffle or Buldger . 
- unless they break your head ? 
- do not worried . 
The Weasley brothers were able to protect the team . 
I want to say that they are a pair of Bludger in flesh . 
Wood took the fourth ball out of the box , also the last ball . Compared to Quaffle and Bludger , it is small , with a large chestnut . 
It is yellow and has tiny silver wings . 
Wood said : 
- this is the yellow Snitch , and it is the most important ball . 
It's hard to catch because flying so fast is hard to see . 
The task of the player is to catch the ball . 
You have to crawl between the Trapper , the Gunman , the captain , between the Quaffle , the Bulldog to catch it before the enemy's Grasshopper , because any Grab that catches it is his team to gain more . one hundred and fifty . 
And that's close to winning . 
That is why the players are so aggressive . A Quidditch match only ends when a team catches the Snitch . 
So the game can last forever . 
It looks like the record is three months long . 
One must have a substitute for the player to take a nap ! 
Do you have any questions ? 
Harry shook his head . 
It is understandable to play for the game , playing for new play is the problem . 
Wood said , while carefully placing the Snitch in the box . 
- I should not do Snitch at this moment . 
It was dark , lost like a breath . 
I practice with these helpers . 
He took the balls to play golf in his pocket , and a few minutes later , the two brothers floated in the air , and Wood tried to throw the ball in all directions , so far Harry . 
Harry did not miss any fruit . 
Wood is very satisfied . 
Half an hour later , the night dew was cold , and the two could no longer exercise . 
On the way to the castle , Wood said cheerfully : 
- This year's Quidditch Cup will definitely go to Gryffindor's hands . 
You are better than Charlie , he is not surprised . 
He did not pursue the dragons he was on England . 
Possibly because of this busy day , three Quidditch sessions a week , and lots of exercise , so much so that Harry did not expect to have been in Hogwarts for two months . 
The castle has become as familiar as its home , more familiar than the house on Privet Drive . 
The lessons are also more interesting , after it has mastered the basic . 
On the morning of festival Ma , people wake up in the smell of deliciously baked bread all over the Hall . The more beautiful it is when Professor Flitwick announces in his class that he is about to teach flying objects , which his students longed for . 
Not once did they see Flitwick make Neville's toad around the room . 
Professor Flitwick divides the class into pairs to practice . 
Harry paired up with Seamus ( well , because Neville had been staring at him earnestly ) . 
Ron , bad luck , was split with Hermione . 
It is hard to say that in this unplanned collaboration between Ron and Hermione who is more angry . 
She had not talked to Ron or Harry since Harry had a broom . 
Professor Flitwick's voice fluttered , and he still had to stand on the pile of books , as always : 
- do not forget that the exercises are practicing wrist movements gently . tone and light . 
Remember , tone and light . 
Remember that reading the right words of the mantra is extremely important . 
Do not forget the mirror of the Sorceress Baruffio , just because of the wrong pronunciation of f to s that eventually a buffalo hit the chest , falling to the floor . 
Fruit is hard . 
Harry and Seamus shook their wrists forever , soothingly and lightly , but the feathers they wanted to fly up and down the floor . 
Seamus loses all patience , pulls out the wand , pokes fun at the feathers ; that Harry had to hurry to put a hat on fire . 
At the table beside him , Ron was also unlucky . 
He waved his arm like a wind turbine , reading out Wingardium Leviosa . 
Harry heard Hermione grumble : 
- You read wrong . 
Must read is Wing - gar - dium Levi - sa , extends gracefully . 
Ron : 
- How good you do not do ? 
Hermione froze , rolled her sleeve up , lighted her wand , and read : 
- Win gar dium Levi o sa 
The feathers on the table suddenly floated up , fluttering over their heads . 
Professor Flitwick clapped his hands : 
- Very good . 
Achieve ! 
Everybody watching this , Hermione was successful ! 
At the end of that class , Ron had an unhappy mood . 
As they left the classroom , Ron said to Harry , 
- No one really tolerates that baby . 
It was a nightmare . 
Suddenly someone rushed past them , thrust into Harry . 
It turned out to be Hermione . 
Harry glanced quickly , surprised to see Hermione tears . 
" Surely Hermione heard you say it badly . 
- So what ? 
Ron was a little nervous , but still said : 
- He must realize why he does not have friends ! 
Philosophy later did not see Hermione in class . 
At noon he did not see her figure . 
On the way down to the Great Hall to attend the Ma ceremony , Ron and Harry heard Parvati tell her Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls ' room , and wanted everyone to leave her alone . 
Ron was more upset about this , but only a little ; As they entered the Great Hall of Fame , the image of Hermione automatically faded in the heads of two boys . 
The bat hangs on the ceiling and walls , while thousands of others swoop down the rows of tables like dark clouds , making the candles in the bowels of the pumpkins flicker and soak . The food suddenly appeared on gold plates , just like in the beginning of the school year . 
Harry had just eaten the baked potato , and Professor Quirrell ran to the Hall , swatting his scarf over his face , 
Everyone looked up at him and ran to Dumbledore's chair , leaning in and stuttering . 
- The devil's giant book of dungeons suggests he should know 
Unfinished sentence , he fell to the floor to sleep . 
The noise growled . 
Dumbledore had to use his magic wand to make a fresh purple fireworks to keep order . 
Ordered : 
- Parents , lead their students to the bedroom immediately . 
Percy executes the order immediately : 
- First year students , holding hands , follow him . 
You follow the instructions of him is not afraid of the giant demon . Stand behind him . Please excuse me for the first year . Sorry , I'm the leader here . 
- Fucking the giant demon back to the dungeon ? - Harry wondered as they climbed the stairs . 
Ron replied : 
- do not ask me . That's really stupid . 
Maybe Peeves spawn it out to shuffle people in the Mausoleum . 
The children go through the rush of people hurrying in all directions . 
As he was crossing a bunch of Hufflepuff - ridden schoolboys , Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm : 
- I remember Hermione . 
- How is she doing ? 
- It does not know the giant demon has a dungeon . 
Ron nodded thoughtfully . 
- You have to find it . 
But best not to let Percy know . 
They dropped off at the end of the line , slammed into the Hufflepuffs , and ran out of the corridor , descending to the women's toilet . 
Just around the corner , they heard footsteps rushed behind their backs . 
Ron pulled Harry into the hiding place behind the big stone columns , saying , 
- Percy . 
But look back , they did not see Percy , but instead was Snape's master . 
He crossed the hallway and disappeared . 
Harry whispered : 
- What are you doing ? 
Why did not he go down to the other professors ? 
- Surely he went to find us . 
Both of them waited for Professor Snape's footsteps away from him to crawl along the corridor . 
Harry said : 
- He went up to the third floor . 
But Ron raised his hand : 
- What do you smell ? 
Harry took a breath and a stench stuck in his nose . 
A mixed smell of old socks and long public toilets do not clean . 
And then they heard - slowly but heavily - the treading of the giant steps . 
Ron pointed towards the end of the left corridor . 
Something terrible is moving towards them . 
Two children shadowed into the shadow that is gradually under the moon . 
What a horrible spectacle : it was four feet high , its skin gray and thick , its rough body rough as a boulder with its tiny bald head emerging like dried coconuts . 
This giant demonic leg is short and fussy like stumps with flat , stubby feet . 
The smell is from the disgusting demon . 
Its long , oversized arm held a log , dragging on the floor . 
The giant demon stopped at the door and peeked in . 
He moved his ear , making his tiny head think for a moment , then decided to walk slowly . 
Harry whispered to Ron : 
- The key is in the door . 
Do you lock it ? 
- Indeed . 
They go to the door , dry mouth , pray that the demon will not turn out . 
With a leap to the door , Harry slammed the door shut , locking the key , pulling the key out . 
- Accomplished . 
With this victory , the two jump up and attempt to run out into the hallway . 
But as soon as they reach the turning point , a scream breaks their heart . 
The cry emitted from the room they had locked . 
- Dead ! 
Ron's face was as bloody as the South's face . 
Harry gasped . 
- that is the female toilet ! 
Both children exclaimed : 
- Hermione ! 
No one wants to , but there are no other options . 
They had to go back to the door , frantically unlocking , trembling in the panic of raising their hair . 
Harry jerked open the door and the two ran in . 
Hermione shrugged at a corner , her face dying . 
The giant demon was walking in front of her , her limbs spilling around the toilets . 
Harry desperately told Ron . 
- Make it tangle up ! 
Then he took the crushed water pipes , took all the power to generate strong wall . 
The demon stopped , a way Hermione . 
He turned his head around , blinking stupidly , finding out where the noise came from . His tiny eyes met Harry . 
He hesitated , then shifted his direction , walking toward Harry , swinging his huge stick . 
- Hey , brains ! 
Ron screamed from the other corner of the room , shaking his hand gently at the demon . 
The iron hit the demon's shoulders , but it did not seem to care . 
However , hearing the scream , it stopped , turning the head extremely ugly to Ron . 
So Harry had enough time to run around the demon . 
- Run ! Hurry up ! 
Harry yelled at Hermione , trying to pull her to the door . 
But she could not move . 
It was close to the wall , mouth gaping horrified . 
Harry's screams seemed to provoke the devil . 
He roared in response to Harry and turned to Ron , the one closest to him , and no way out . 
At that time , Harry did something brave and stupid : he shot up the demon's back , using his tiny arm to pinch the giant demon . 
The devil may not feel that little Harry is wearing his neck , but even if it was a giant demon , it would have hurt if someone poked a stick with his nose . 
Harry's hands were wandering at the wand . 
He always poked his wand into the demon's nose . 
Waking up in pain , the demon writhes and swings the tree in his hand . 
Harry grasps the demon's neck , risking his life to snatch life : every second , the demon can grab it and beat it dead with the woodblock . 
Hermione was scared to the floor . 
Ron withdrew his wand - not knowing what to do , he heard himself reading the bouncy note in his head : 
- Wingardium Leviosa . 
The woodpecker suddenly slipped out of the demon's arms , flying high up in the air , then back , pounding hard on his master's head . 
So strong that the whole room shakes . 
The demon curses his face , slowly slams the floor with a beard , lies down , im re . 
Harry stood up . 
It shakes and almost breaks . 
Ron stood dumbfounded with his wand in his hand , rounding his eyes with the result of what he had just done . 
Finally , it was Hermione who spoke first . 
- Is it dead ? 
Harry replied , 
- Probably not . 
It was just fainted . 
Harry bent down , pulling his wand out of the demon's nose . 
The rod is sticky like mucus . 
- Gee , the demon's nose . 
She wiped the wand into her demonic pants . 
Suddenly there was a loud cracking of the door and the sound of his foot . 
Three children look out . 
During the fight , they did not notice the noise caused by them , but the upstairs man heard the sound of the demon and the crash . 
In a flash , Professor McGonagall ran into the room , followed closely by Professor Snape and Professor Quirrell . 
When he saw the demon , Quirrell gave a weak cry and sat down beside a toilet bowl , holding his chest . 
Snape looked down at the demon . 
Professor McGonagall looked at Ron and Harry . 
Never before had Harry seen such anger in her eyes . 
Her lips are white . 
The hope of finding fifty points for Harry's Gryffindor was dissipated in a flash . 
- What do you think of that ? 
Her voice was cold . 
Harry looked at Ron , standing still with his wand in his hands . 
- Thank you for not killing me . 
Why not stay in the bedroom ? 
Snape looked at Harry with fierce glances , and Harry looked down at the floor . 
He just wanted Ron to lower his wand . 
At that moment , a small voice came from the darkness . 
- Miss McGonagall , please do not punish them . 
They just look for children . 
- Hermione ? 
Hermione stood up . 
- Well , I went to find the giant demon because I thought I could cope with it . She also knew that I read all the books about demons . 
Ron dropped the wand . 
Hermione , who dared to lie blatantly with the homeroom teacher ? 
" If they do not find you , then you are dead . " 
Harry thrust his wand into the demon's nose , and Ron hit the demon with the devil's tree . 
They did not run to call anyone . 
When they ran , the demon was about to kill her . 
Harry and Ron tried to pretend they knew it , nothing new . 
" Well , in this case , " said Professor McGonagall , looking at the three children , " Hermione , you stupid child , how can you think that you alone can confront a big demon like a mountain ? 
Hermione bent . 
Harry did not say a word . 
Hermione was the best student in the school , but now she deliberately broke the rules to save her two sons . 
This story is as monstrous as Professor Snape in class that give candy to students . 
Professor McGonagall decided : 
- Hermione , for the Gryffindor family lost five points . 
I am very disappointed with you . 
If you do not get hurt , head back to Gryffindor Tower . 
Pupils continue to eat in each dorm . 
Hermione stepped out . 
Professor McGonagall turns to Harry and Ron : 
- Okay , well for those two , few first year students can fight with such a huge demon . 
Each child gets five points for the Gryffindor . 
I will tell this to Professor Dumbledore . 
You can go back . 
The two rush out of the room , not speak until they climb up two floors . 
It is so light when the distance from the smell of the demon , how strange new smell ! 
Ron : 
- we should have scored more than ten points ! 
- There are five points . 
Hermione lost five points and then what ? Harry corrected . 
- Also admitted that in the case help me get out of trouble it is good too . 
But , we saved it ! 
- If you do not lock the demon with it in the toilet , it does not need to save me . 
- Ron reminded Ron . 
Two children came before the portrait of Mrs. Beo . 
They say together : 
- Pork muzzle . - then walked into the common room . 
The room was crowded and noisy . 
People are eating things up from the Great Hall . 
Only Hermione stood alone by the door , waiting for Ron and Harry to return . 
A little confused . 
Then , all said without looking at anyone : 
- Thank you ! 
Then all three rushed to pick up the plate to eat . 
Since then , Hermione has been friends with Ron and Harry . 
There are things that once you have gone through together , one can not love each other . 
And to knock down a giant four meters high is one of those things 
Chapter 11 : QUIDDITCH 
November has arrived . 
It became cold . 
The mountains around the school are grayed out and the lake surface resembles a cold steel mirror . 
Bright morning , frost cover the school grounds . 
From the window upstairs , Hagrid could see himself wrapped in a moleskin , wearing rabbit - skin gauntlets and wearing beaver - colored leather boots . 
He squated on the bushes outside the Quidditch field , finished , he bundled them . 
Quidditch season has started . 
This Saturday Harry will play his first match , Gryffindor vs . Slytherin . 
If the Gryffindor win this match , they will be second in the championship . 
No one was seen rehearsing for Harry , because Mr. Wood had decided to keep secrets about Harry , as a secret weapon for the Gryffindor squad . 
However , I do not know how the news also spread , that Gryffindor's Gryffindor is Harry ! 
The rumors are divided into two sides , ( which Harry does not know which side would be more tragic ) : the party is convinced that Harry will play brilliance , the side said they would have to carry the ring around the yard to catch Harry . 
Fortunately now Hermione has become a friend of Harry and Ron . 
Without it , Harry would not be able to handle the whole task , for every minute he had to scold him for training . 
Hermione also borrowed a Quidditch book from the ages , a book that turned out to be very attractive . 
Thanks to the book Harry learned that there were seven hundred cheats in Quidditch and that all seven hundred were in the World Cup in 1473 ; In Quidditch , the player is usually the smallest and most nimble player , as well as the most dangerous casualties ; Although no one died while playing Quidditch , there were several referees who disappeared after the match and then returned to the Sahara several months later . 
Hermione has been somewhat relieved of breaking the rules since being saved by Harry and Ron from the giant demon . 
She is much nicer now . 
The day before Harry's first Quidditch match , the three ran out of the playground at the time of the play . 
It was cold that Hermione was able to see a bright blue flame that could be placed in a jar of jam . 
The three of us were gathering their backs to the fire to warm up , and Snape was passing by . 
Harry noticed that his legs were limping . 
The three rushed closer together to cover up the flames , because this was obviously a violation of the rules . 
Disgusting are the guilty faces of them as Snape noticed . 
Master 
hello to 
You do not see the fire , but it looks like you are trying to find something to scare the kids . 
- What game , Potter ? 
It's Quidditch through the ages . 
Harry took the book out . 
Snape said , 
- Who brought the book out of the library ? Give this to me . 
Except for Gryffindor five points about this . 
As Snape loped away , Harry muttered : 
- He made this rule ! 
Do not know what his legs are ? 
Ron cynical : 
- He knew . 
But I pray for him painful pain ! 
That night , Gryffindor's common room was extremely busy . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione sat next to each other by the window . 
Hermione was rehearsing for Ron and Harry . 
She had no way of giving them two turns . Every time he asked , Hermione asked , " How do you understand ? " 
But when I think of the way to ask her to do exercises , two children always have the correct answer . 
Harry felt so restless . Forget about worrying about tomorrow's match , Harry thought of reclaiming Quidditch through the ages . 
Why is it afraid of Snape ? 
Oh , what are you afraid of ? 
He stood up , telling Ron and Hermione that he was going to see Snape , asking if he could get the book back . 
Both said : 
- You go , we do not dare . 
Harry thought as if there was another teacher who witnessed the book , Snape would hardly refuse . 
So it went straight to the teacher's office and knocked on the door . 
Nobody answered . 
Harry knocked again . 
Not heard anything . 
Or did Snape leave the book in the room and run away ? 
So why not try to see Harry push the door of the room and crept into the interior . 
An intimidating scene hits his eyes . 
Snape was in the room , alone with Filch . 
Snape's master grasped his loincloth , pulling over his pillow , revealing a bloody knee , swollen ; Filch was bandaging for Snape . 
- goddamn things ! - Snape growled . - Why do you say you watch three heads at once ? 
Harry gently closed the door , but : 
- POTTER ! 
Snape's face wrinkled with anger . 
He let go of his sack and fell over his knee . 
Harry : 
- I just want to get back to the book . 
- GET OUT ! 
Flute 
Harry left , before Snape's teacher left Gryffindor more points . 
It went upstairs . 
Asked Ron : 
- Is it okay ? What's going on ? 
Harry lowered his voice , whispered to Ron and Hermione what he saw . 
It does not go out at the end of the story : 
- You know what that means ? 
He tried to cross the three - headed dog on the night festival Ma ! 
When we saw him go up there , remember ? So he wanted to steal the package that the dog was guarding . 
I dare to take my broom out of the fish with you , it was Snape who released the giant demon to distract . 
Hermione rolled her eyes . 
She said : 
- Are not . 
Snape , I do not know , but no matter what , you're trying to steal what Dumbledore is storing . 
Ron : 
- Hermione , to be honest , you think the teachers are all holy ? 
I believe in Harry . 
I do not ignore Snape's most active one . 
But what is he going to steal ? 
What is the guard dog ? 
That question stuck in Harry's mind even when he was in bed . 
Neville was snoring like Harry while his eyes were open . 
He tried to get everything out of his head . 
He needs sleep . 
It must sleep . 
Only hours left was Harry entering the first Quidditch battle of his life . But Snape's expression when he caught the wound on his knee - that strange face of anger - made Harry not easily forget . 
Soon , the radiant dawn was cold . The Hall of Fame smells of fried sausages and um of lurking sounds of children are eagerly awaiting a Quidditch match or game . 
- You have to eat something ! 
- I do not want to eat anything . 
- A piece of toast ? 
Although Hermione begged , Harry shook his head : 
- I'm not hungry . 
It feels too frightening . 
Only one more hour is it going to the stadium . 
- Harry , you need to eat well ! 
Seamus said , The player is always the enemy punched for the most tear . 
Harry looked at Seamus , dipping sauce onto the sausage and said , 
- Thank you , Seamus ! 
At eleven o ' clock , it seemed as though the whole school was pouring around the Quidditch field . 
Many students also carry tubes . 
Although the seats have been raised to the sky , it is sometimes difficult to keep track of some of the games . 
Ron and Hermione , together with Seamus , Neville and Deam , sat in front row seats . 
And Harry was both amazed and thrilled when he saw the trumpets on a large , bespectacled banner made of bed sheets scraped by the Scabbers . 
On the banner , Harry Potter is called Marshal and Dean Dexter has drawn a large lion , the Gryffindor symbol just under the name of Harry . As such , Hermione also hand out a small spell , causing the paint to stain again color change . 
Meanwhile , in the dressing room , Harry and the rest of the team are wearing crimson Quidditch shirts . ( Slytherin in green ) . 
Wood cleared his throat : 
- Come on , listen to this brother ! 
- And sister too ! - Trace Angelin add . 
Wood agrees : 
- Yes . 
Come on , brothers and sisters ! This is our battle . 
- A big fight - Fred says climb . 
" A game that we all expect , " added George . 
Fred said to Harry : 
- We memorized Wood's speech . 
Last year also in the same team that ! 
Wood said : 
- Are you two silent ? Dear brothers and sisters , this is the best Gryffindor team from many years . 
This time we will win . 
I know for sure . 
Then he glared at the crowd as if to say , " Well , we have to win , if not 
- Yes . 
It's time . 
Wish you all luck . 
Harry followed Fred and George out of the dressing room , hoping his knee would not fall down as he stepped out in the cheering cheer . 
Hooch hoars the referee . 
She stood in the middle of the court waiting for the two teams to come out , one of whom held the broom . 
When all the players were standing around , Hooch said : 
- All games here , I want to play a really nice game . 
Harry noticed that Hooch apparently sent those words to Slytherin captain Marcus Flint , a sixth - year student . 
Looking at Flint , Harry felt like he had the blood of a giant demon . 
But when looking up to see the banner fluttering on the tank , with the words Harry Marshal , Harry's heart like dancing in the chest . 
It feels more courageous . 
- Up the broom ! 
Harry climbs the tree with Nimbus 2000 . 
Hooch blows a siren with a whistle . 
Fifteen broomsticks in the air , increasingly higher . 
The game begins . 
- And immediately , Angelina of Gryffindor won the ball Quaffle . 
Well , this girl is an excellent sailor , but attractive 
- Jordan ! 
- Yes , I'm sorry ! 
As Professor McGonagall reminisced , Lee Jordan swings his ear . 
He is a friend of two Weasley twins , and is the commentator for the game today , under the close supervision of Professor McGonagall . 
- And now , ladies and gentlemen , she is going up high , an accurate pass for Alicia Spinnet , a new discovery by Oliver Wood , who last year was sitting in the bench was passed to Angelina Ồ , no . , the Slytherin team won the Quaffle . 
Yes , Slytherin captain Marcus Flint has won the Quaffle and flies Flynt flying like an eagle . He is about to fail . Gryffindor's captain , Wood , excels at Flint's ball and regains his Quaffle ball over there . Gryffindor's Katie Bell arrives promptly , dives around Flint , then hits the back of the stairs . Maybe injured , a Bludger bumps into the hands of Slytherin . Adrian Pucey is speeding to the pole . But a second Bludger blocked his way . This Bludger was Fred or George ? 
It's hard to say exactly . Anyway , the Gryffindor attacks were spectacular , and Angelina once again captured the Quaffle , in front of her completely empty and barefoot . She had to say she was flying . Avoiding a Bludger Going to the golf club in front of you and try to come up , Angelina Bletchley dives down and then GRYFFINDORS NOTE ! 
The Gryffindor puppet boomed , boiling the cold air , while the Slytherin squealed , moaning . 
- Give it up , give it up ! 
- Uncle Hagrid ! 
Ron and Hermione sit back and take Hagrid's place to join them . 
He patted the big pipe , dangling around his neck , saying , 
- Have a look outside the hut . 
It can not be fun sitting in the crowd like this . 
So far , I have not seen the snitch ball ? 
Ron replied : 
- No ! 
Harry had nothing to do at all ! 
- Just avoid the collision , Eh , there are things . 
Hagrid arched the tube , toward the sky where Harry was hanging , looking like a dot . 
Striding on it , Harry was wandering around , staring narrowly at the match and squinting for the Snitch . 
This is Wood's strategy . 
He had instructed Harry : 
- You keep dodging until you find Snitch . 
We do not want you to attack without having to hand . 
As Angelina scored , Harry trained a few rounds from one post to the other for the final blow . 
Now he is awake , focusing on Snitch . 
At times it caught a glimpse of a golden light , but it was just the reflection of the Weasley twins ' watch . 
Then one time the Bludger rolled over Harry , fighting it like a cannonball , and Fred came in time to chase away the ball . 
An angry blow to the Bludger ball sent to Marcus . 
Fred still asked : 
- Are you alright , Harry ? 
In the stands , Lee Jordan is eagerly commented : 
The Slytherin are on the ball , the Pucey player has dived , dodging the two Budgers , crossing the Weasley brothers , crossing the Bells , he is speeding in the direction of Drilling to see if the ball is Snitch 
Buzz emerged and spread throughout the crowd , as Adrian Pucey let go of the Quaffle because he looked at it with a glint of yellow light , soaring across his left hand . 
Harry saw Snitch . 
She threw herself down with a flash of gold in a fierce excitement . 
Slytherin's player Terence Higgs also saw the ball . 
The two embankments collide with Snitch . 
All The two teams seem to be familiar with their missions , just hanging out , flopping between the air . 
Harry was faster than the Higgs . 
He saw the tiny ball with its wings , flying high up in front . 
Harry put a speed break to spur 
HAPPY ! 
Then a growl grows from Gryffindor fans : Marcus Flint deliberately bares Harry's broom , causing the broom to fall off the flight , knock Harry out , and if Harry does not try to pinch the broom I have to play network . 
Gryffindor fans scream : 
- Punish . 
Hooch angrily criticized Flint and gave Gryffindor a penalty 
Temple . 
But after a moment of turmoil , the Snitch was gone . 
In the stands , Dean screamed out loud : 
- chase out the yard ! 
Referee , red card ! 
Ron asked curiously : 
- What are you talking about , Dean ? 
Dean still burned with indignation : 
- Red card ! 
In football , that error must be red card out of the yard . 
- But this is not soccer ? 
Quidditch does not have the right to kick players out . 
However , Hagrid fought with Dean : 
- Actually , one has to change the law . 
Flint guy nearly knocked Harry out in the sky and what ! 
Lee Jordan is hard on the side . 
It's a double comment : 
- So after the clear and lousy discussion 
Professor McGonagall : 
- Jordan ! 
- Well , I mean after the publicity and the bad 
- Jordan , I warn you ! - Professor McGonagall accented . 
- Yes , Flint almost killed Gryffindor's Gryffindor , if anyone else is dead , I guarantee , and the penalty for Gryffindor Spinnet made England neat . 
The match continued , Gryffindor still holding the ball 
Just as Harry dodged another Bludger that was jumping over his head , it was a dangerous accident . 
Its broom is suddenly shaken , scary scary . 
In the blink of an eye , Harry thought he was about to fall . 
He gripped the brush with both hands and gripped his knees . 
In life , it never felt so terrible . 
The broom shook again , seemingly wanting to scare Harry away . 
But ever before , has Nimbus 2000 ever decided to move people so suddenly ? Harry tried to turn to the home team . 
He hesitated , half wanted to ask Wood to pause the game , not half . 
At that moment , Harry realized that his broom had become irreparable : he could not turn back the broom . 
Not drive . 
The broomstick wandered up to the sky , occasionally whipping one , causing Harry to fall . 
Lee is still commenting on the match : 
- Slytherin holding the ball Flint having the ball Quaffle you pass Spinnet through the Bell A bludger blows on him , probably the nose too , I'm kidding her Slytherin NOT REGISTERED ? 
Slytherin fires . 
It seemed that no one noticed Harry's broom behaving strangely . 
It was bringing Harry up . 
Gradually , separated from the game , just flew over the region , kickback . 
Hagrid murmured : 
" Do not know what Harry is doing ? " 
He peered through the tube . 
If I do not know about the boy , I will assume that it does not control the broom 
Suddenly , everyone in the stands pointed to Harry , high on the table . 
Its broomstick is spinning , spinning , and it is just clinging to the brush . Then the crowd gasped : Harry's broom jerked wildly , knocked out Harry . 
Now , Harry had only one hand on his broomstick , and he wore it in the air . 
Seamus whispered : 
- Or when Flint saved , what did he do broom ? 
Hagrid trembled , saying : 
- Can not be There is only a strong Black sorcerer who is allowed to float the broom . How can a little kid catch a Nimbus 2000 tree ? 
Hearing that , Hermione snatched Hagrid's tube , but instead 
Looking up at Harry , she pointed the tube at the search crowd . 
Ron , you gray face , moan : 
- What are you doing ? 
Hermione gasped : 
- Know that Snape , Master ! 
Ron took the tube . 
Snape was in the middle of the crowd , on the opposite platform . 
His eyes stared at Harry and his lips muttered constantly without breath . 
Hermione said : 
- He's definitely doing something that's bending on a broom ! 
- What should I do now ? 
- let me settle ! 
Ron had not spoken yet , Hermione had disappeared . 
Ron pointed the tube at Harry . 
Harry's broom still shakes . 
Harry barely clung to the broom . 
The whole crowd stood up , watching , scared , as the Weasley brothers flew up , trying to pull Harry out of their broomstick , but they did not care : Near Harry , the crazy broom jumped higher up . 
They dropped low , circling around under Harry , hoping that if he fell , they would catch him . 
Marcus Flint admits to having caught the Quaffle , scoring five goals without any notice . 
Ron muttered desperately : 
- Hermione , hurry up ! 
Hermione was in the crowd , hurried back to Snape . 
She ran across the row behind him ; So much so that he did not stop apologizing when he slammed into Mr. Quirrell , causing him to roll down the front seat . Reaching down to where Snape stood , Hermione staggered , drew her wand , muttered a few words . 
A light of blue flashes from the tip of the chopsticks to Snape's lapel and ignites . 
It probably took Snape thirty seconds to realize he was in a fire . 
Heard him for a minute , Hermione knew that he had done the job . 
Collecting the flame in the tiny bottle that she hid in her pockets , Hermione crawled back to the back seat , assuming Snape never knew what had happened . 
But that's enough . 
On top of that , Harry suddenly made a mistake , climb up the broom firmly as before . 
Ron called to Neville : 
- neville , now look at that . 
Not this time , this gentle boy hid in Hagrid's jacket and sobed for five minutes . 
At that moment , the crowd saw Harry rush to the ground , clenching his hands as if about to vomit . 
He landed on his limbs , coughing , and something yellow fell into his palm . 
He raised it from his head , shouting : 
- I caught Snitch ! 
The match ended in an extremely embarrassing situation . 
Twenty minutes later , Flint was still booing . He did not catch it , he swallowed the ball . 
Anyway , the results are the same . 
Harry did not violate the rules , and Lee Jordan still cheered as a result of the game : Gryffindor won 170 - 60 . 
However , Harry did not hear the screams : he was making a hot tea in Hagrid's house , along with Ron and Hermione . 
Ron explained : 
- Old Snape . 
Hermione and I saw him biting his broom , his mouth muttering constantly , his eyes not leaving her for a second . 
But Hagrid dismissed : 
- Nonsense , bullshit ! 
What did Snape do ? 
Harry , Ron and Hermione looked at each other , saying what to say to Hagrid . 
Finally Harry decides to tell the truth : 
- We discovered his secret . 
He tried to cross the three - headed dog on the night of the Ma ceremony . 
He is bitten by dogs . 
We thought he wanted to steal what the three - headed dog was guarding . 
Hagrid dropped his tea : 
- How do you know about Fluffy ? 
- Fluffy ? 
- Ờ It's my dog ​​ Buy from a Greek guy I met at a pub last year I loaned Dumbledore to watch it 
Harry is impatient : 
- What ? 
Hagrid suddenly changed his tone irritably : 
- Well , do not ask me again . That is top secret , uh , top secret . 
- But Snape was going to steal it ? 
Hagrid again dismissed : 
- Nonsense , bullshit ! 
Mr. Snape is a professor at Hogwarts School , and he's going to do something again ! 
- Then why did he try to kill Harry ? 
Exclaimed Hermione . 
The noon events seem to have changed her mind about Snape . 
- Uncle Hagrid , you look at the broom , I have read all the books on the subject . 
Whenever I want to look , I have to look away from him , but I see Snape do not blink . 
Said Hagrid , 
- I told you we were wrong ! 
I do not know why the broom of Harry stabbed so , but Snape no way of trying to kill students ! 
Hey , listen , all three of us fly , no matter what happens . 
Dangerous . 
You forgot about the dog , forgetting what it was watching over . It was Dumbledore's and Nicolas Flamel's . 
Harry shouted : 
- A ! So there is someone named Nicolas Flamel involved in this , right ? 
Listen to it . 
Hagrid looked mad at himself . 
Chapter 12 : Photo Gallery 
Christmas is coming . 
On a midsummer morning , the entire Hogwarts school woke up , all over the place where the white snow covered the yard . 
The lake was frozen , and the Weasley twins had been punished for having sprained the snowballs around Professor Quirrell , and then bounced up behind his scarf . 
The storms in the snowstorm to deliver the letter was sanctioned by Hagrid before he could fly further . 
Everyone is anxious waiting for the holidays . 
These days , the Gryffindor living room and the Great Hall of Fame burned charcoal in the fireplace , but the corridors were cold . The winds of the skin shook and shook the windows of the study rooms . 
The worst thing was that Snape's class was in the basement . There the children breathed out smoke , and stood as close to his hot lap as possible . 
One day , in the poison class , Draco Malfoy said : 
- I feel sorry for the children to stay in school , the family did not welcome them to eat Christmas . 
When he said that , he turned to Harry Potter . 
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled . 
Harry was weighing the lion's spear so that he did not care about them . 
Since Gryffindor's victory over Slytherin , Malfoy has become increasingly upset . 
Slytherin loses the battle , Malfoy tries to make fun of the crowd by telling the story of being a big frog who will replace Harry as a player in the next match . 
And when no one was laughing , because everyone was recovering from Harry's handling of the broom , he became increasingly angry and jealous , turning to scold Harry for not having a family of his own . 
It is true that Harry will not return home at Privet Drive 4 for Christmas . 
Last week , Professor McGonagall surveyed , then made a list of students who would stay in school during the semester . 
Harry registered immediately . 
It does not have anything to call it poor . 
Maybe this will be the most beautiful Christmas season that it has ever had . 
Ron and his brothers stayed in school , because this year Mr. and Mrs. Weasley visited Charlie in Romania . 
After the study , when they left the basement , the children discovered a large pine tree at the end of the corridor . 
But thanks to two huge legs protruding under the tree and hissing voice that they know immediately Hagrid is standing behind . 
Ron quickly put his head on the leaves , asking : 
Hello , Hagrid . 
Do you need a helping hand ? 
- Can not handle it , thank you , Ron . 
There was a cold Malfoy sounding behind him : 
- Are you out of the way ? 
Standing there to earn some money , Ron open ? 
I see you look forward to become gatekeepers after finishing Hogwarts . 
Which , in fact , brought Hagrid's hut with the drive of your house , then the palace as well as the cup ? 
Ron snapped at Malfoy while Snape appeared at the stairs : 
- WEASLEY ! 
Ron let go of Malfoy's collar . 
Hagrid stuck his head out of the thick branches of his bearded hair , saying , 
" Professor Snape , it was Malfoy who made the first . 
Malfoy insults Ron Weasley . 
Snape said sweetly : 
Even so , Hagrid , fighting is still a violation of Hogwarts rules . The Gryffindor House is deducted five points . 
And Ron Weasley , bless you are only minus it . 
Well , disband , the whole of them fly ! 
Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle rushed through the pines and fell out of abundance of needles all over the place , and they were delighted . 
Ron looked at the Malfoy , clenching his teeth : 
- I will beat it . 
One day I will beat it ! 
Harry said : 
- I hate both : Malfoy and Snape . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Come on , come on , come on Christmas . 
What am I supposed to tell you ? Well , follow me in the Hall of View . 
The three of them followed Hagrid and the pine tree of the infamous Hall . 
Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick are busy decorating it . 
- Oh , Hagrid ! 
Can you put that last tree in the corner ? 
The hall looks splendid . 
The corolla and the wire rope hung across the wall and there were no less than a dozen pointed pine trees standing in the room , some sparkling like small spheres , others flickering hundreds of candles lit up . 
Hagrid asked Hermione , 
- In a few days , I go to the holiday home ? 
Hermione replies : 
- I'm gone the next day Oh , you ask me to remember Harry ! Ron ! Half an hour before lunch , so we are in the library ! 
- Yeah , that's right . 
Ron struggled to close his eyes from Professor Flitwick : He was using a wand , pouring out a pile of gold balls , and hanging them dangling on the branches of the pines . 
Hagrid followed the children out of the Hall . 
- Library ? 
Arrive at the place but also library . 
We fly to work hard . 
Harry laughed : 
- Why do not we read books ? Because since you mentioned the name of Nicolas Flamel , we are curious to know who he is . 
Hagrid looked startled . 
- What are you flying ? Listen to this , we told them to fly and then put away the case . 
The dog does not have anything to do with you ! 
Hermione said : 
- We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is ! 
Harry added : 
- If you tell us , is there a problem ? 
We have searched hundreds of books and still can not find him anywhere Uncle only need to suggest a little I remember that you read his name is where it is . 
But Hagrid was still cold : 
- I will not say anything . 
- Then we have to go to self ! 
Said Ron , hurrying to the library , leaving Hagrid looking irritable . 
From the moment Hagrid spends his name on the Flamel name , the children are really looking for books , because , from this clue , they know where to look for the material . which Snape master to steal ? 
The trouble is not knowing where to start from , and whether Mr. Flamel has ever done something to write in books but also look up . 
There is no name in the Great Twentieth Century Wizards , nor in the remarkable mysterious names of our time . 
In The Important Modern Explorations of No Name , Flamel , and A Study of Recent Developments in Sorcery . 
There are , of course , plenty of other books to look at in the library : tens of thousands of books , thousands of bookshelves , hundreds of rows of tall bookshelves that form narrow passages . 
Hermione took the list of books divided by subject and title to look up , while Ron crawled into the rows of shelves , pulled the books to the books . 
Harry is wandering the restricted area . 
It is doubtful that the Flamel name may be somewhere in this area . 
Unfortunately , the Limited Book Catalog required a special recommendation from one of the new teachers , which Harry knew was impossible to obtain . 
Books in the Restricted area include high school black magic books that Hogwarts never taught children . 
Only large class students are allowed to refer when doing intensive research on Black Arts Prevention . 
- looking for something , that game ? 
- Yes , nothing . 
Pince , the librarian , swirled the dusty broom at Harry . 
- Take the soul out of this place , fast ! 
Out ! ! ! 
Harry left the Restricted Area , just thinking about having enough of his mind to make up an excuse . 
Hermione , Ron and it was agreed that it would be better not to ask Pince about Flamel . 
Mrs. Pince is sure to know about Mr. Flamel , but if this comes to Mr. Snape , then he guesses what they are doing is very risky . 
Harry waited for Ron and Hermione to find a clue , though he did not expect much . 
After all , even if they have been searching for two weeks , but only for short periods of time , between classes or hours of play , so if they do not find anything , it is worth taking . strange 
They needed a longer look and did not look up at Mrs. Pince's neck . 
Five minutes later , Ron and Hermione came out , shaking their heads . 
They all went to lunch . 
Hermione said : 
- When you go to the holiday home , you keep looking . 
If you find something , then send a message to tell me the news ! 
Ron suggested : 
- You also ask your parents if they know who Flamel is . 
Asking them is probably safer . 
Of course , because my parents are dentists . 
The holidays started , Harry and Ron had wonderful days , so much so that they almost forgot the name Flamel . 
Both dormitory now only two children . 
The living room is more spacious , empty than usual , so they can pull their favorite two chairs to the fireplace . 
They sat for hours , eating whatever their forks were : buns , ghetto muffins , kneecap just eating plan . 
Malfoy was expelled . That is what we enjoy most when it can not be done . 
Ron also began to teach Harry to play witchcraft . 
This is the same as the Muggle chess , except for the live chess pieces , which makes playing a witch game is like commanding two armies outside the battle . 
Ron's flag is old and worn out . 
Well , what's Ron's not , never belonged to someone in the family ! 
This chess set is Ron's grandfather . 
The chess pieces are silent , but that does not hurt : Ron knows them so well that he does not have any difficulty in controlling the general . 
Harry used the pieces of Seamus on loan , but these chess pieces do not seem to trust him at all . 
At any rate , Harry is not a good chess player , so the chess pieces of it are screaming each other , it goes to this army , eat the other , upset both : 
- do not you make me go there , do not you see that there is no way to block it ? Going to the other guy , I have lost him is also okay ! 
On Christmas Eve , Harry went to bed with eagerness to look forward to tomorrow , to have a good meal and have fun , but he did not expect any gifts at all . And yet , when he woke up to the fog the next morning , the first thing he saw was a small pile of bundles of gifts , which lay at the bottom of his bed . 
Harry jumped out of bed , in his shirt , then Ron greeted in a sleepy voice : 
- Merry Christmas . 
- Merry Christmas . 
Harry responded and added , 
- Go and see : I also have gifts ! 
- What do you think it is ? 
Beets ? - Ron said as he turned to look at his presents , louder than Harry's . 
Harry picked up the top package . 
The package is wrapped in a thick brown paper , on which writes the words Hagrid zigzag , giving Harry . 
Inside is a wooden flute , carved roughly . 
Apparently , Hagrid made a gift for Harry . 
It brought to my mouth - the flute sounded like a night owl . 
The second gift is very small , accompanied by a letter : 
We received your blessing 
Include a Christmas present for your child . 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia . 
Attached to the letter is a coin of fifty cents . 
Harry noted : 
- So very friendly . 
Ron is very fond of this fifty cents . 
It says : 
- Weird ! 
What a strange shape ! is that money ? 
Seeing Ron enjoying the silver coin , Harry laughed happily . 
- You keep it playing . 
So Hagrid and my aunt give gifts , and who else give me ? 
Ron just a bundle of bumps , slightly pink : 
- I know who the gift of the gift . 
My mother . 
I told my mother that you did not expect to have Christmas gifts , so Ooh , my God , knit you a warm sweater ! 
Harry tore the package , pulled out a very thick , jade - colored warm handbag , and a large box of chewy sweets made by a Mrs. Weasley hand . 
Ron was also opening his gown , saying , 
- Every year the cheeky knit warm for us . 
And this year his shirt is also the color of wine ! 
- Your mother is kind . 
Harry said , eating candy , the candy is delicious . 
Harry's next gift pack is also candy : a huge box of Enfantish Egg Chocolates , donated by Hermione . 
Only one gift package left . 
Harry picked up his palm . 
It is very light . 
Harry opened the last gift . 
Something silver - gray and soft like water , slipped to the floor , rests with that shiny fold . 
Ron gasped : 
- I heard about this ! 
He dropped the box of marshmallows that Hermione had donated , and it was filled with emotion : 
- If this is what you think it is rare and really valuable . 
- What is this ? 
Harry picked up the silver shimmering cloth from the floor . 
The feeling is strange , as if it was woven with water yarn . 
Ron's face was full of amazement . 
It says : 
- Invisibility cloak ! I'm sure it's that shirt . 
Harry put his shirt over his shoulder and Ron shouted : 
- that's it ! 
Look down your feet ! 
Harry looked down at his feet , but did not see his legs anymore . 
He ran back the mirror . 
Now there is no doubt that the mirror is the image of it , but only a head is suspended in midair , while the entire body is completely invisible . 
He pulled his jacket over his head , and it disappeared completely . 
Ron suddenly exclaimed : 
- There is a letter ! 
Have a letter fall out of the shirt ! 
Harry took off his shirt and took the letter . 
The sloping , slender handwriting that it had seen before . 
Letter : 
My father left this to keep before his death . It's time to get back to you . 
Know how to make use of it . 
Wish you a Merry Christmas . 
There is no signature at all . 
Harry stared at the letter . 
Ron admired the invisibility cloak . 
It says : 
- I am willing to trade anything to get this jacket . 
Anything . 
OK ? Do not you ? 
- No problem ! 
Said Harry , his voice very strange . 
Who sent it this jacket ? 
Was this shirt used to be his father's shirt ? 
But it did not say anything , the door to the room was open , then the two Fred and George are in the air . 
Harry hid his shirt . 
He did not want to share his father's belongings with anyone else . 
- Merry Christmas ! 
- Hey , look ! 
Harry also has a warm coat Weasley ! 
Fred and George are both wearing a blue sweater , but one is embroidered with a yellow F , while the other is embroidered with a G . 
Fred picked up Harry's warm sweater and looked at him . 
- Harry's shirt is more beautiful than our shirt . Knitting for others to see the cheeks more work than knitting for the children ! 
George asked : 
- Why do not you wear your shirt , Ron ? 
Wear it , nice and warm clothes that . 
Ron was wearing a shirt over his head , lamented reluctantly : 
- I hate wine ! 
George observed his shirt and said , 
- I did not embroider my name on my shirt . 
Maybe I'm not afraid of you forgetting your name like us . 
But we're not that bad : We know our names are Fred and George ! 
- What's so noisy ? 
Leader Percy poked his head through the door , looking unhappy . 
He must have just opened his gift box , because in his hand he also had a big warmth . 
Fred grabbed the shirt immediately : 
that's it ! 
There is the letter P , which probably represents the captaincy of Percy . 
Wear him Percy ! We all wear our blouses ! Harry had one too . 
The twins immediately turned their heads over Percy's head , slamming his glasses , for he continued : 
- I do not want 
George says : 
- You do not have to stay in the boss room anymore . 
Christmas is a chance for families to reunite that ! 
The two brothers twirled in the armpit of the bride jumping out of the room . 
In life Harry has never eaten a Christmas Eve party like that : hundreds of turkey revolting fat ; mountain barbecue and baked potato ; fatty sausage plates ; Then buttered peanut butter ; There are boats carrying fatty sauce sauce , meringue sauce . 
Along the table , about a meter away there was a sack of witchcraft . 
These amazing guns were completely different from the Muggle stuff that the Dursleys had bought , with plastic junkies and some rickety paper hats inside . 
Harry and Ron pulled a witchcraft gun . 
It exploded , but not as a one - off , but a loud boom , and covered both of them with thick blue smoke . 
clouds ; And from the bowels of a cannon exposed a navy hat with so many mice - live rat may hoi ! 
At the top of the table was the teacher's desk , Dumbledore was changing the top of the witch's hat to get a floral bouquet and laughing happily at the joke that Professor Flitwick had just read to him . . 
Christmas cake is served immediately after turkey . 
Percy nearly broke his teeth because of a silver sickle hidden in his loaf . 
Harry looked at Hagrid's face , redder and more red , so he still called for more wine . 
Then he kissed on Professor McGonagall's cheeks , the professor's cheeks flushed shyly and - Harry was surprised - the professor giggled , the cone hobbled sharply aside . 
Finally , as Harry stood up from the dining table , he staggered because of the items he had picked up : stuff from his bowel , some sparkling bubbles , a self - propelled kit , a set of chess pieces A new witch for herself , and a whole band of cannons . 
The white puppies ran away after the firecrackers , and Harry felt dizzy , daring to turn them into a Christmas party for Mrs Norris , Filch's mistress . 
Harry and the Weasleys had a good afternoon : fighting a fatal blow in the school yard with snowballs . 
Then , cold , wet , and exhausted , they pulled back to the Gryffindor warmth . There , Harry opened his new chess set and lost to Ron a skateboard . 
He thought it might not hurt so much , if Percy did not try to help him so much . 
After the meal there are turkey sandwiches , sponge cakes , cream cakes , and cakes . 
Everyone felt so full and sleepy that he could do nothing but sit there watching Percy chase Fred and George all the way around Gryffindor Tower , for they had stolen his captain's badge . 
It was the most beautiful Christmas day that Harry had ever enjoyed . 
But there is still a long time in his head . 
Until she got to bed , she was still thinking about it : the invisibility cloak , who sent the jacket to him . 
Ron , after stuffing turkey's stomach and biscuits , had no secret in mind , then rolled to sleep , just in time to pull the curtain around the bed . 
Harry leaned to one side of the bed pulling an invisibility cloak from under the bed . 
The treasure of his father It was once his father's . 
It makes the fabric smooth as water flows through his hands , smoother than silk , as light as air . 
Take advantage of the shirt . 
This is the same message . 
Now he tried to put on his shirt . 
She slipped down on her bed , wrapped her around her waist , looked down at her feet , saw only the full moon and the shadows . 
That is ridiculous ! 
Take advantage of the shirt . 
Suddenly Harry awake . 
With this invisibility cloak , the entire Hogwarts school would be no secret or limited to it . 
Harry stood there , silent in the dark , but his emotions all over his body . 
In this invisible cloak , it can go anywhere . 
Filch still could not know . 
Ron sleeps dreamily . 
Should it be awakened ? 
Suddenly there was something stopping Harry . 
In his invisibility cloak . 
He felt that this time - for the first time - he wanted to use his shirt alone . 
Harry quietly out of the bedroom , down the stairs , across the common room , through the hole portraits Mrs. Beo . 
- Who's that ? 
Mrs. Beo shouted . 
Harry did not say anything . 
He just hurried down the corridor . 
Where to go now ? 
Harry stopped , his heart beat , thinking . 
And the idea came up . 
Yes , Restricted Area of ​​ the library . 
In this invisibility cloak it can read as much as you want . Read until you find out who Flamel is . 
Harry aimed at the library and walked over , clutching his invisible cloak . 
The library is dark and mysterious . 
Harry lit an oil lamp to see the path along the bookshelves . 
The light seemed to float in the air , and although Harry himself held the lamp , looking at the bright spot in the darkness , it also had a spine . 
Restricted area is at the end of the library . 
Carefully crossing the rope to block the area with the rest of the library , Harry raised his lamp to read the titles . 
The titles did not give Harry anything more . 
The gilded letters fade , in the language that Harry does not understand . 
There are even books out there . 
A book stains a stain that looks like a terrible blood . 
Harry's hair rose up . 
It sounded like a faint whisper from the books . 
It may be imaginary , but it may sound true : the books seem to know that there are people here , who might not have been here . 
Where to start looking up ! 
Carefully putting the lamp on the floor , Harry looked along the last book on the shelf , trying to find one that looked interesting . 
A large black book and silver gleam grabbed Harry's eyes . 
He pulled the book hard , because the book was so thick . Having put the book on his knees , Harry opened the book . 
A fierce hissing tear the silence - the book is screaming ! 
Harry folded the book sharply , but the screeching sound grew louder and louder , his voice shaking , his hands shaking . 
Harry scared back and forth , touching the lamp that made it go out . 
There was footsteps in the hallway outside . 
Harry panicked , scrambled the book screeching on the shelf , then ran his neck . 
It ran across Supervisor Filch at the entrance . Filch's long , pale eyes peered through Harry . 
Harry fumbled under the hand of his teacher Filch is up horizontal exit that corridor , in the ears still groaning moaning cry of wet book . 
Suddenly Harry stopped short in front of a tall dress . 
Hiding away from the library , Harry did not notice where he was heading . 
Also , it may be because it's so dark , so it's impossible to determine where you are . 
He still knew there was a suit of armor near the kitchen . 
But the kitchen must be at least five floors above . 
- Teacher , he told me that anyone who goes to bed in the night must come to report directly to the teacher . 
Now let me tell you that there are some people who are just in the Restricted Area of ​​ the library . 
Harry's face is no longer bloody . 
He found no way to hide , the supervisor Filch can find a way to get to his neck right , because his waist , rin hitch is closer and closer . 
But even more frightening was the voice Snape responded to : 
- Restricted Areas ? 
Well , it's not far away , we ' ll catch it . 
Harry stood on the spot when Mr. Filch and Snape appeared at the corner of the front wall . 
Of course they did not see Harry , but the corridor was very narrow , they stepped closer and how it hit it . 
Stealth only makes Harry unseen , but his body remains intact . 
Harry had to go back , faster spike . that is the only hope . 
He sneaked through the door , holding his breath , pulling himself away from opening the door , lest the door cried out , the disaster would come down . 
Why can not Harry get peacefully ? 
She breathed a sigh of relief . 
The other two passed by without detecting anything . 
Harry stood close to the wall , took a deep breath , listened to their footsteps fade away . 
Oh , that was so close ! 
A few seconds later , Harry began to notice the room he was hiding inside . 
The room was like an abandoned classroom . 
He fumbled the tables and chairs to the wall , and there was a trash can . 
But leaning against the wall opposite Harry was something that did not look like the furniture of this room . 
It looks like an object is pushed not only to empty the road . 
It is a huge mirror , high overflowing house , gold frame carved , placed on two clawed feet . 
An inscription on the top of the mirror : ERROR STYLE EHRU OYT UBE CAFRU OYT ON WOHSI . This sentence can be translated and then reversed , it will become as follows : Heart in the wish to make the mirror that mirror I . ) ] . 
The dread was no longer heard when the sound of Mr. Filch or Mr. Snape was heard , Harry bravely walked up to the mirror , looking at himself , though he did not see anything , of course . 
Harry stepped closer , in front of the mirror , and immediately raised his mouth to let out a scream . 
He turned around . 
The heart throbs more than when the book wet drip cries . 
Because it not only sees itself in the mirror , but also a bunch of people standing behind it . 
But looking back , the room was completely empty . 
Harry gasped , slowly looking back at the mirror . 
Behold , its scene in the mirror , white and frightening speaking place ; Next to it is the silhouette of at least a dozen others . 
Harry's head back : behind him there is no one ! 
Or are they also invisible ? 
Was it in a room full of invisible people ? 
And this mirror thieves them by reflecting invisible , invisible or invisible ? 
Harry looked in the mirror again . 
A woman standing behind her was smiling and waving at her . 
He raised his hand to the back , into the air . 
If she was there , she must have touched her , in the mirror , she stood next to him . 
But Harry just felt the air . 
The woman and others only exist in the mirror . 
She is a beautiful woman . 
Her hair color is dark , and her eyes , like her eyes too ! 
Harry thought as he moved closer to the mirror . 
His face was the same , but Harry suddenly realized she was crying . 
Her lips are smiling , but her eyes are crying ! 
The tall , thin , black - haired man , standing next to him , wrapped an arm around his grandmother . 
He wore glasses , hair ruffled , standing upright , exactly like Harry's hair . 
Now , Harry was so close to the mirror that his nose almost touched Harry's nose in the mirror . 
He whispered : 
- Mama ? Three ? 
They just looked at him smiling . 
And Harry slowly looked up at the faces of the others in the mirror , catching the other blue eyes that looked just like his eyes . 
Someone has the same nose as his nose , even he sees the knees of an old man as bleak as his knees . 
It - Harry - is seeing his family , for the first time in his life . 
The Potter family waved a grin at Harry while Harry looked at them desperately . 
His hands pressed against the glass as if hoping that if the glass fell , it would fall inside , fall into the arms of the intestines . 
In her heart , a sharp pain cramp up : half happy sad sad . 
He stood there for a long time , he did not know either . 
The images in the mirror do not blur and keep looking forever , until there is a distant sound , bringing it back to reality . 
It can not stand here forever . 
Make your way back to the bedroom . With his eyes closed from his mother's face , Harry whispered : 
- You will come back . 
Then hurriedly left the room . 
- You should wake up . 
Said Ron , sulking . 
Harry confesses : 
- Tonight I returned . 
You can go with me tonight , I want to show you the mirror . 
Ron is very eager : 
- I want to see your cheeks . 
- I also want to see your family - all of the Weasley family . 
Tonight you remember showing me your other two brothers , with all the other family members ! 
Ron said : 
- You want to see them difficult ? 
Going to my house in the summer is all over . 
Well , maybe the mirror just shows the dead . But so bored , still can not find the Flamel's whereabouts . 
Do you eat bacon or something ? 
Why do not you eat anything ? 
Harry could not eat . 
He had met his mother and he would meet them again tonight . 
It almost forgot Flamel . That does not seem to matter anymore . 
She needs to know what the three - headed dog is supposed to do . 
Snape , what's going on with him ? 
It just needs to meet his three cheeks . 
Asked Ron anxiously . 
- You do not , Harry ? 
Too much face . 
What Harry fears most is that he may not be able to find the mirrored room again . The next night , he and Ron wrapped themselves together in an invisible cloak , step by step . 
They tried to find their way from the library , circling the dark corridors for almost an hour . 
Said Ron : 
- I'm freezing . 
Come on , do not look anymore . 
- Are not ! 
Harry harshly . 
I know where it is . 
The two pass by the ghost of a witch surfing in the opposite direction , in addition to no one . 
Just as Ron was about to moan , his legs were numb to death and Harry saw the high armor . 
- here it is . 
This place is right here ! 
The two pushed the door open . 
Harry took off his invisibility cloak and ran to the mirror . 
They are there . 
Her mother and her father watched him with joyful eyes . 
- See anything ? 
Asked Harry , small Ron . 
But Ron said , 
- I do not see anything . 
- Take a look ! 
Look at them all 
- I only see each other . 
- Look straight in the mirror , here , stand where I stand . 
Harry moved to one side , but when Ron was in front of the mirror , Harry could no longer see his family . 
Just saw each of Ron in wrinkled pajamas . 
But Ron's eyes glinted at the image in the mirror . 
It shouted : 
- Look at me ! 
- Do you see the whole family standing around you ? 
Asked Harry . 
- Are not . 
I see myself but I see much enlightenment , I'm older Oh ! 
We are the male lead ! 
- What ? 
- That guy , Look , I wear the badge like Bill was back then Ồ , I'm holding the Cup and Quidditch Cup , look , I'm Quidditch captain too ! 
Ron looked away from the wonderful images in the mirror to look back at Harry eagerly . 
- Do you think this is the mirror of the future ? 
- How can that be ? 
All my family died and let me look again . 
- You watched the whole night , now let me see a little more . 
- But your picture is not that good , you just hold the Quidditch Cup . 
And I saw my parents . 
- do not push yourself 
A sudden sound was heard outside the hallway . 
The two of them end the fight . 
They suddenly realized how loudly they spoke . 
- Hurry up ! 
Rom threw the invisibility cloak over both of them , just in time Mrs. Norris with cat - like eyes , go to the door . 
Ron and Harry stood there for a moment , both of whom shared the same thought : do not know if the cat's eye could see the invisibility cloak ? 
After a century , the cat left . 
- Not done . 
Could it find him Filch ? 
I bet he heard us . 
Run away . 
Ron pulled Harry out of the room . 
The next morning , the snow was not melting . 
Asked Ron : 
- Playing chess , Harry ? 
- Are not . 
- Or did I go down to see Hagrid ? 
- No , you go away 
- Harry , I know what you're thinking , the mirror is not it ? 
Do not go back tonight . 
- Why not ? 
- I do not know . 
I only have a bad feeling about it . 
Again , you have too much faith in the news . 
Mr. Filch , Mr. Snape , and Mrs. Norris , were always hanging around . 
If they caught you ? They do not see you , but if they touch you for instance ? 
Or if something goes wrong ? 
" You say Hermione's voice . 
- I'm serious , Harry , do not go . 
But in Harry's mind , there was only one thought , that of returning to the mirror . 
And Ron could not stop it . 
That third night , Harry found a way to the mirror room faster than before . 
He steps quickly and knows that he is foolish causing too much noise . 
But fortunately , no one . 
And there his parents still stood there watching him smile , and one of the crowd , trying to nod happily with her . 
Harry sat down in front of the mirror . 
Surely it will sit there all night with the family , as if nothing could break it off the mirror . 
Nothing . 
Except 
- So you come back , Harry ? 
Harry was startled , hearing his whole body as frozen as ice . 
He looked behind him . 
No one else than Albus Dumbledore was sitting at a table near the wall . 
Harry must have passed by the wrong thing . 
He was so eager to run the mirror that he did not pay attention . 
- Teacher , I have not seen you . 
Dumbledore said : 
- Extremely strange when invisible people are stabbed into severe myopia . 
Dumbledore smiled and Harry gasped . 
He left the table , sat down on the floor with Harry . 
So the Son , like hundreds of others before him , discovered the joy of the Imaginary Mirror . 
" Teacher , I do not know his name . 
- But now I hope you realize what it is . 
- Yes , it appears to your family 
- And it appears to Ron that you see yourself as the male lead ? 
- How do you know that ? 
Harry gasped , but Dumbledore insisted : 
- I do not need a coat to become invisible . 
Now , do you understand the illusion for us to see something yet ? 
Harry shook his head . 
- to explain to you . 
The happiest person in the world is someone who can use the illusion mirror as a normal mirror , meaning that he can look in the mirror and find himself just as he is . 
Do you understand ? 
Harry thought . 
Then he slowly said : 
- The mirror shows what I want Anything I want 
Dumbledore said in a low voice . 
- That is also true . 
It shows us exactly what is most wanted in our hearts , no less . 
As in my case , I never knew my family , so I saw the people standing around me in the mirror . 
And Ron Weasley , who was always obsessed by his shadow bushes , found himself standing alone , better than all the others . 
This example , however , does not bring us any knowledge or truth . 
Someone who has wasted his whole life sitting in front of him , being what they see in the mirror makes confusion , or goes crazy , only to realize that illusion means not real . 
Can not be real . 
Harry , this mirror will be moved to another room tomorrow . 
And I ask you not to find it again . 
If you happen to meet him later , then you have been prepared for today . 
The illusion mirror is not intended to let people fall in love with their dreams and forget to live . Remember that . 
Well , put on a great invisibility cloak and hurry to the bedroom . 
Harry stood up . 
- Dear Professor Dumbledore Are you allowed to ask me a question ? 
- Obviously you asked me a few things . 
However , you may ask me one more thing . 
- When you look in the mirror , what do you see ? 
- I ? 
I found myself holding thick woolen socks . 
Harry looked up at him . 
Dumbledore continued : 
- I have never had enough socks . 
Another Christmas season has come and gone but we have not got a pair of socks . 
People keep on giving us all the books . 
Only after coming back to the room and climbing up to bed , Harry figured out that maybe Dumbledore's answer was not entirely true . 
But , she reasoned when she threw the Scabbers out of her pillow , at the question she posed to Dumbledore as a bit private . 
Chapter 13 : NICOLAS FLAMEL 
Dumbledore convinced Harry not to look for the illusion , and for the rest of the Christmas holiday , the invisibility cloak was neatly folded under the chest . 
Harry wished he had forgotten what he had seen in the mirror , but he could not forget it . 
Nightmares began to assault him . 
She dreamed of dreaming her cheeks disappearing in a blinding blue light , at the same time a vicious laugh on the high . 
When Harry told Ron about his dream , Ron said , 
- You see ? 
Brother Dumbledore is right : that mirror can make you mad . 
Before the start of the second semester , Hermione returned to school and looked at everything with a different eye . 
She was horrified to hear that Harry had left the bed and wandered through the school for three nights ( Thanks Filch for catching you ! ) . 
On the other hand , Hermione was extremely disappointed that Harry had not figured out who Nicolas Flamel was . 
They almost attempted to search for Flamel in the library book , though Harry was still sure he had read the name Flamel . 
Entering the new semester , the youngsters can only whisper their books over ten minutes during the play time . 
Harry has less time than either of you , because the Quidditch sessions have already started . 
Wood has more practice than ever before . 
Despite the snow , it rained continuously , but he did not flinch . 
The Weasley brothers lamented that Wood was becoming a madman , but Harry had become Wood . 
Because if they win the next Hufflepeff match , for the first time in seven years , they will regain the title of Slytherin Home Champion . 
In spite of the will to win , Harry rushed into the practice , finding out that such exhaustion was less of a nightmare because there was only water to sleep on . 
Then , in a training session where everyone was wet and slurried muddy wood , Wood informed the team a bad news . 
He was mad at us because the Weasley twins were bombarded with bombs , and he dropped his broom . 
Wood screams : 
- Did you two stop playing that game ? This team will lose the game because of that ! 
This match Snape as the referee , he just pretended to make me excuse me Gryffindor team for that ! 
The words made George fall out of his broom . 
It erupts in the muddy mouth : 
- Master Snape as the referee ? 
Any time now , when did he ever referee a Quidditch match ? Slytherin , how do you do justice to the siren ? 
The team landed on George next summer to complain . 
Wood said : 
- that's not my fault . 
We only have the country trying to play a pure battle , clean , so that Snape master of any excuse can grab us . 
There was no other way , but Harry had another reason why he did not expect Snape to come close when he was playing Quidditch . 
The team now claps to each other as usual after the rehearsal , but Harry goes straight to Gryffindor's common room to find Ron and Hermione . 
Two people are playing chess . 
The only thing Hermione did was win , and both Ron and Harry gave it a better deal for her . 
Harry sat down next to him , Ron said , 
- Do not talk to me now , I'm concentrating 
But at the sight of Harry's face , Ron exclaimed : 
- What's up ? Looks so awesome . 
In a whisper , for the rest of them to hear , Harry told the two of them that Snape had suddenly turned to False Quidditch . 
Hermione finished saying : 
- do not fight anymore ! 
Ron agrees : 
- Say you are sick ! 
Hermione suggested : 
- Or pretending to break leg ? 
Ron snapped : 
- Or make a broken leg 
But Harry said , 
- I can not do that . 
There is no substitute in the team . 
If I retreat , the whole team can not compete . 
Neville suddenly dumped into Gryffindor's common room . 
I did not understand how she got through the portraiture of Mrs. Beo , because her legs were stuck together , and everyone realized immediately that Neville had been hit by a tentacle . 
He must have jumped all the way back to Gryffindor Tower . 
Everyone laughs , except for Hermione . 
She straightened up , practicing the curse . 
Neville's legs are separated and he stands up , still trembling . 
Hermione led Neville to sit next to Ron and Harry , asking : 
- What happened ? 
Neville stammered : 
- Malfoy met him outside the library . 
It says it is looking for someone to try to practice the curse . 
Hermione advises Neville : 
- Miss McGonagall go ! 
But Neville shook his head . 
He said childishly : 
- I do not want to have more trouble . 
Ron said : 
- You must know to resist it , Neville ! 
Although he used to bully people , he did not have to lie down in front of him , so it was easy to trample on him . 
Neville choked : 
" Well , do not scold me for not being brave enough to be a Gryffindor member , Malfoy , " he said . 
Harry searched in his pocket , taking out a frog chocolate bar , the last of the box Hermione had donated to him at Christmas . 
It brought the chocolate to Neville . 
He looked like he was going to cry , and said , 
" You're worth twelve Malfoy guys . 
Did not the sorting helmet choose you for Gryffindor ? 
It was given to the Slytherin House . 
Neville's lips ached with a faint smile as he opened the chocolate bar : 
- Thank you Harry I must go to sleep . Do you want to keep the card ? You are collecting cards ! 
When Neville was gone , Harry looked at the famous Witch Card . 
It says : 
- Dumbledore again ! 
The first card I have is also the instrument 
Suddenly Harry gasped . 
He looked at the back of the card . 
Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione , whispering : 
- I found him . 
I found Flamel ! 
I told you this name I read somewhere . 
Ha I read it on the train to Hogwarts . 
Listen : Dumbledore is particularly famous for defeating the Black Wizard Grindelwald in 1945 ; discovered twelve uses of dragon blood , and thanks to his work on the alchemist co - written with collaborator Nicolas Flamel ! 
Hermione stood up . 
Since she got her Gryffindor grades back for some great homework , she never looked so excited . 
- Wait here ! 
Hermione finished running up the stairs to the girls ' bedroom . 
Harry and Ron had not even exchanged a glimpse of her , so she fled as she flew back , holding a great book in her hand . 
The girl excitedly explained : 
- I did not think to look up this book . 
I borrowed from the library a few weeks ago , intended to read light entertainment only . 
- Is this so light ? 
Ron wondered , but Hermione told him to shut up , until she found something , turning the pages over , muttering to herself . 
Finally she seemed to have found what she was looking for : 
- I knew ! 
I know it ! 
Said Ron , 
- Are we allowed to speak ? 
But Hermione did not pay attention to Ron . 
She said in a dramatic voice : 
- Nicolas Flamel is the only author of The Stone Witch ! 
Both Ron and Harry were not as expressive as Hermione expected . 
They asked again : 
- What ? 
- Oh , really , why do not you read it , read it . 
She pushed the book toward them , Ron and Harry read together : 
The classic alchemist study focuses on the Stone of Witchcraft , a mythical material with strange powers . 
The stone can convert any metal into gold . 
The stone also creates the immortal substance that makes the drink immortal . 
For many centuries there have been reports of the Stone of the Witch , but the existing stone belongs to Nicolas Flamel , an accomplished alchemist and a playwright . 
Flamel celebrated his 665 th birthday . 
He is living a secluded life in Devon with his wife Perenelle ( 658 years old ) . 
- Understand ? 
Asked Hermione , as Ron and Harry finished reading . 
Definitely a three - headed dog watching Flamel's Flamethrower ! 
I'm sure he got Dumbledore to keep it , because you two are friends , and you know someone wants to steal it . 
So the stone was taken out of Gringotts Bank ! 
Harry : 
- A stone that makes gold and makes people immortal . 
What master Snape wanted to occupy it . 
Everyone wants to have it . 
Ron also realized : 
- We did not find the name Flamel in the study of recent developments in magic , because it was 665 years old , but not recently ! 
The next morning , in the Black Hawk Art Prevention Room , Harry and Ron have copied the different cures of being wolfed by the werewolf , hawking the gibbons about what they would do if they had the Stone Witch . in hand . 
When Ron says he will be shopping for a Quidditch team , Harry will remember the upcoming game and , of course , Snape . 
He told Ron and Hermione : 
- I will play . 
If I did not attend , then Slytherin would have thought I was dead , not dare to confront Snape . 
I will show them that I win and they laugh . 
Hermione said : 
- It's just that we can not laugh at having to clean you up on the court . 
But no matter how hard Harry talks to Ron and Hermione , he feels increasingly anxious as he gets closer to the day of the competition . 
The Gryffindor team are equally worried . 
Winning the Slytherin Home Championship for seven years is a great idea , everyone is eager and determined , but now with a good referee , will they do it ? 
Harry did not know if he imagined it too much or not , but how it felt it had to face Snape master forever where it is , where to go . 
It even suspected Snape was watching it , trying to catch it in battle . 
The study of the poison became a weekly torture for Harry . 
Mr. Snape treated it badly . 
Have you ever learned that the three of them have found the secret of the Witch Stone ? 
Harry could not have known it , he thought , but thought it was not safe , Harry sometimes felt Snape could read the thoughts of others . 
The next afternoon , before Harry walked into the dressing room for the players , Ron and Hermione wished Harry good luck . 
Harry recognized in the voice and the faces of two confused friends whether he survived to see his friends again . 
It can not be considered encouragement or comfort . 
He hardly heard a single word in Wood's usual speech , as he drove his Quidditch shirt and took the Nimbus 2000 . 
Then , Ron and Hermione found a spot in the stands next to Neville . 
This boy can not understand why his two friends are so moody . 
It is impossible to understand why they go to see Quidditch , but they carry wands like soldiers carrying weapons . 
Neville and Harry both did not know that Ron and Hermione had secretly practiced the Bantam Curse . Suggested from Malfoy's evil game for Neville , Hermione decides to apply this tactic if there is any indication that Snape wants to harm Harry . 
Ron put his wand in his sleeve , and Hermione muttered : 
- No drama . do not forget it . 
Ron grumbled : 
- I know . do not mess anymore ! 
In the dressing room , Wood pulls Harry out in particular : 
- I do not mean to put more pressure on you , but at this moment , than at any other time , we need to catch the Snitch as quickly as possible . 
It was soon enough to finish it before Snape gave Hufflepeff too many points . 
Fred Weasley poked his head out the door and observed : 
- The whole school has a football field Cha ! 
Both Dumbledore came to see . 
Harry's heart thumped : 
- Dumbledore ? 
He ran to the door to see for himself . 
Fred is right . 
The bearded silver hair 
Can not be mistaken for anyone . 
Harry can laugh for a while . 
So it's safe . It's simply that Snape never dares to play Harry in Dumbledore's eyes . 
Sure , Snape was angry when he watched the two teams enter the field . 
Even Ron noticed that . 
She said to Hermione : 
- I never saw Snape as crowded as this meal . 
Look ! They started Oi ! 
Someone sticks to Ron's head . 
It was Malfoy . 
- Oh , sorry Ron . 
Do not see you sitting there . 
Malfoy grinned at Crabbe and Goyle : 
- I do not know how long this Potter can hold a broom handle this time ? 
Anyone dare to fish ? What's wrong , Ron ? 
Ron did not reply . 
Snape rewarded Hufflepeff with a penalty just because George Weasley had hit a bludger on the mage . 
Hermione , in the first minute of the match , had crossed two fingers on her lap , eyes did not leave Harry . 
It is hovering around like a hawk on the battlefield , trying to find the Snitch . 
A few minutes later , Snape rewarded Hufflepeff with a penalty without a reason . 
Malfoy says aloud : 
- What do I think about their selection of Gryffindor players ? 
They choose pitiful people . 
Think of it , a Potter boy without his parents , then two Weasley boys without money , Neville Mason . 
You also deserve Gryffindor : You do not have a brain ! 
Neville blushed on the seat to look straight at Malfoy . 
It states : 
- Tao worth twelve guys like you Malfoy . 
Both Malfoy , Crrabbe and Goyle laughed out loud . 
But Ron , still not dare to leave the game , applauded : 
- Neville , you dare say it straight in the face , very good ! 
Malfoy : 
- Eternal Vong . 
If your brain is yellow , then you are much poorer than the weasley guy . 
That story enough to say 
Ron's nerves are strained because of Harry's anxiety . 
It covers : 
" Malfoy , " said another , " watch out . " 
- Ron ! 
Hermione screamed . 
- See Harry ! 
- What ? Where ? 
Harry suddenly went down spectacularly , the crowd held their breath and followed . 
Hermione stood up , her two index fingers crossing the sewing bridge she placed on her mouth . 
Harry was descending to the ground like a bullet . 
Malfoy taunted : 
- Thank you Ron . 
It must have been Potter's eyes to see the silver fell on the ground so quickly down to pick up . 
Ron jumped up . 
Malfoy did not know what was going to happen , Ron jumped on him , it rolled to the ground . 
Neville hesitated , but then climbed over and sat with Ron . 
Cried Hermione . 
- Come on , Harry ! 
She climbed up the stool to cheer on Harry , who was surpassing Snape . 
Hermione did not even know that Malfoy and Ron were hugging each other in the chair , or in the other corner , another crackling creaking of croaking , clattering , and mingling sounds between Crabbe , Goyle and Neville . 
On top of that , Snape just turned the brush at the right time there was a bright red color across the teacher , just a few inches away . 
A second later , he realized that it was Harry , who jumped up after the break , then held up high in victory : the Snitch was in his hand . 
The collapses seemed to collapse in shock : No one had ever witnessed a Quidditch match that Snitch shot so fast . 
Hermione jumped into the chair , hugged Parvati in the front row , danced and screamed : 
- Ron ! 
Ron ! 
The match is over ! 
Harry won ! 
We won ! 
Gryffindor topped the table ! 
Harry jumped out of his broomstick as it descended three feet from the ground . 
It can not believe it . 
It has completed the task . 
The match was over . 
No more than five minutes have ended ! 
While the Gryffindor fans poured out the ball to congratulate , Harry noticed Snape's lord landed close to him , his face white and lips tight . 
Then suddenly Harry felt a hand on his shoulder . 
He quickly looked up to see Dumbledore's fresh face . 
Dumbledore whispered , just to Harry alone : 
- Very good . 
I'm glad you do not fall in love with the mirror Try hard work Good job ! 
Snape bitterly cries to the ground . 
A moment later , Harry leaves the dressing room alone , taking his Nimbus 2000 to the broomstick . 
It can not be remembered that in her life there are times like this happy today . 
It really did a great job . 
Now no one can say that it is only nominal . 
The evening wind had never been so sweetly sweet to Harry . 
He stomped his feet on the wet grass , reminiscing about the last moment and listened in joyous joy . 
Harry recalls Gryffindor fans rush to channel it over their shoulders , Ron and Hermione standing in the distance , dancing jubilantly ; Ron cried with his nose bleeding . 
Harry came to the house to broom . 
She leaned against the wooden door and looked at Hogwarts . 
The glass windows were glowing with the reflection of the sunset . 
Gryffindor topped the table . 
Harry has completed his mission . 
It proved to Snape 
Well , talk to Snape 
A huge shadow rolled down the steps in front of the castle . 
That shadow moved quickly towards the forbidden forest , obviously not wanted to be seen . 
Victory glinted in Harry's eyes , as he watched his shadow . 
He realized that the shadow of that shadow . 
It was Snape . 
He sneaked out of the forest while everyone was gathering for dinner What's wrong ? 
Harry jumped on the Nimbus 2000 and soared . 
Quietly past the castle , Harry realized Snape was hurrying into the woods . 
He immediately followed . 
The trees grew so thick that Harry could not see where Snape had gone . 
It flew around , lowering , gently touching the tops of trees , until it heard his voice . 
He glided toward that , hugging an oak tree without a sound . 
Carefully crawling along a branch , clutching the broom , trying to see through the leaves . 
Underneath , in a tiny shadow , Snape stood there , but not alone . 
Professor Quirrell is also present . 
Harry did not see Quirrell's face clearly now , but his voice stuttered three times more than ever . 
- I do not know where I want to meet you here , Mr. Snape ? 
Master Snape replied , cold ice : 
- I want to keep this private . 
Also , do not let students know about the Stone of the Witch . 
Harry leaned in to listen . 
Mr. Quirrell stammered something , but Snape cut off : 
- Have you figured out how to overcome Hagrid's three - headed monster ? 
- But , but , Snape , I am 
Mr. Snape took a step , looked closely at Mr. Quirrell : 
- You do not want to be rivals with me , Mr. Quirrell ? 
- I do not know what you want ? 
- You know me well ! 
An owl suddenly popped out of the tree . 
He kept his balance just as Snape said , 
- His spunk . 
I'm waiting . 
- But I do not 
- That is enough . 
Snape's teacher cut off . 
- We will discuss this later , when he has enough time and thought back and decided to put his loyalty where . 
Snape snapped his jacket over his head and stepped out of the forest . 
It was almost dark now , but Harry was still able to see Quirrell standing there for a long moment , as if it were petrified . 
- Harry , where are you going ? 
Hermione nods as Harry walks into Gryffindor Tower . 
Ron punched Harry on Harry's back and yelled : 
- Win ! 
We won ! 
You won ! 
And I also beat Malfoy a game out , swollen eyes ! 
Neville was also the only one for Crabbe and Goyle . 
It's a bit of a rant , but Mrs. Pomfrey says it's okay for the Slytherins to know the hand ! 
Everyone is waiting for you in the common activity . 
We are having a party , Fred and George are stealing some cakes and other food in the kitchen . 
Harry tried to take a breath , panting , 
- Leave it aside . 
Now is not the time . 
We went to find an empty room , I will tell you 
He closed the door behind him , checking to make sure the Peeves were not stealthily hiding somewhere in the room . 
- We were right . 
It is the Stone of the Witch . 
Snape was pressing Mr. Quirrell to help him get the Stone . 
He asked Quirrell if he knew how to get past Fluffy's three - headed dog . 
Then he said something about Quirrell's mockery . 
I guess in addition to Fluffy , there are other things that guard the Rock , many other things . 
Maybe , spellings , for example . 
And Quirrell probably knows some of the anti - black curses Snape needed to cross . 
Hermione thought , 
- So long as Mr. Quirrell still holds up with Snape , is the stone still safe ? 
Said Ron : 
- Probably next Tuesday is the stone ! 
Chapter 14 : Wild Animals 
Professor Quirrell turned out to be more courageous than the kids thought . 
In the following weeks , he seemed greener and thinner , but did not seem to have been knocked out . 
With each passing third hallway , Ron , Harry and Hermione pressed their ears to the door to check if Fluffy was still snarling inside . 
Snape's master still has frequent attacks , indicating that the Rock may remain intact . 
These days , every time Harry had the opportunity to walk past Mr. Quirrell , he was looking at him , smirking at the smile that motivated him , and Ron began to scold friends : Every time there is a fake clone of Quirrell . 
However , Hermione did not devote herself to the Stone of the Witch . 
She was busy planning her studies with a timetable recorded in her notebook , which was filled with red lead . 
Harry and Ron did not do that , but Hermione kept chewing on them all the time . 
- Hermione , a whole new century to the exam ! 
Hermione resists : 
- There are still ten weeks , not the whole century ! 
Not to mention Flamel , it was only a second ! 
" What do you mean Flamel , who lived to 665 years old ? " 
Again , what do you do when you know it ? 
- What do I study ? 
Are you crazy ? Do you understand that we have to pass the new examination is up in the second year ? 
The exams are extremely important , should be dedicated to the exam this month and then have to . 
I do not know what to do to be here now 
The risk is that the teachers have the same thoughts as Hermione . 
They went to the mountains for student work . 
The Easter egg is no fun , especially compared to the last Christmas . 
How happy it is , when next to the baby Hermione continuously twitter twelve ways to use the blood or practice dragon dance with the magic wand . 
Harry and Ron had to spend all their free time regretting the baby , having lamented and yawned , but still had to finish the mountain work . 
Until one noon , Ron can bear , bursting . 
He threw an angry goose feather to the ground , staring out at the window of the library , 
- I can not remember the three jams ! 
It was a beautiful day , a beautiful day after many cold and rainy months . 
The sky is blue , the flowers do not forget - I bloom green , and the summer flavor seems to be somewhere in the wind . 
Harry searched for the basil in One Thousand Herbs and Magical Mushroom , so he did not hesitate to hear Ron complain . 
But he raised his head immediately when Ron asked : 
- Uncle Hagrid , what do you do in the library ? 
Hagrid hid , hiding something behind his back . 
Dressed in mudskin jackets , he looked so lost in the academy called the library . 
He said , in a sly voice that made the kids excited . 
- Just passing through a little look ! 
Oh , what are you doing here ? 
They also look to find out about Nicolas Flamel again , eh ? 
He changed his suspicious voice . 
But Ron said with great force : 
- Oh , we found out who he was from late . 
And we know what your three - headed dog is guarding . that's H 
- Suit ! 
Hagrid looked around to see if anyone was watching . 
- Do not scream about that , what's wrong with us ? 
Actually , there are some things we want to ask you , about keeping the stone , but apart from the Fluffy 
- SLOW ! 
Hagrid had to tell the children to speak in a loud voice . 
- Listen to me - Come to me later , I promise to tell you anything . 
But be absolutely careful . Do not be shy at this place . 
Students are not allowed to know that . 
Some people think I reveal to you 
Harry said , 
- So see you later ! 
Hagrid walked out of the room . 
Hermione looked pensive : 
- What does he hide behind me ? 
- What do you think is related to the Stone ? 
- let me go back and see that he found books in the shelves is known . 
Said Ron as he stood up . 
He was already in school because he was ready to make excuses for stretching . 
Just a few minutes later , she returned with a pile of books in her hands . 
Pile the books on the table , it whispered : 
- Dragon . 
Uncle Hagrid look up books about the dragon ! 
Watch out : The dragon breeds in England and Austria , From egg to fire - guide for dragon farmers . 
Harry said : 
- Hagrid still likes to have a dragon , he told me so when I met him for the first time . 
- But it's illegal ! 
Shouted Ron . 
It is well known that the Warlocks Conference in 1709 prohibited the raising of dragons . 
If we keep farming dragons in the garden , the Muggle people will notice , and then find us right . 
Besides , I also can not taming the dragon , very dangerous . 
You see the scans of Charlie's brother to the wild dragons in Romania here ! 
Good business ! 
Harry wondered : 
- But are there wild dragons in England ? 
Of course . 
Green and Black . 
But I told you that : The Minister of Magic has the duty to stop the information about the dragons . 
So his soldiers keep watch , every Muggle people who see the dragon that they must curse right , let people forget that they have seen the dragon . 
Hermione recounts : 
- What did Hagrid hide ? 
An hour later , the kids knocked on the door of the locker hut . 
They were surprised to see that all the windows and doors were closed . 
From inside , Hagrid asked : 
- Who's that ? 
Then he opened the door for them , then quickly closed it . 
The inside is extremely hot . 
Although it was warm outside that day , Hagrid's house was still burning in the fireplace . 
Make tea and invite the children to eat mink buns . 
The children are now too close to Hagrid , so they immediately turn away the dog and dog breeders the other day . 
- Why do you want to ask me something ? 
There is no need to cross the three kingdoms , said Harry immediately : 
- Yes . 
We are wondering , can you tell us apart from Fluffy , what else is guarding the Rock ? 
Hagrid frowned at Harry . 
He said , 
Of course I can not say . 
First of all , we ourselves do not know . 
Second , I know too much , so I do not know what to say to you anymore . 
It is safe to keep the stone here is justified . 
It's almost stolen from Gringotts . 
I guess I also learned about that and then snuck out ? 
As for Fluffy , I lost ! 
" Uncle Hagrid , I said that , because I do not want to tell you . 
You know everything that happens here . 
Hermione's voice was gentle , warm , and flattering , making Hagrid's beard quiver slightly , showing that he was smiling . 
She continued : 
- We just wondered , besides , Dumbledore can trust anyone to be in the middle of the stone , too ? 
Hagrid's chest seemed to bounce up when he heard the words . 
Harry and Ron winked at Hermione . 
" Well , it would not hurt to tell you that to see the Fluffy borrowed my spell from some of the other professors , Professor Sprout , Professor Flitwick , Professor McGonagall . 
Point names of professors at the fingertips . 
- Professor Quirrell And of course Professor Dumbledore also has his charms . To look , wait a bit , I forgot a person . 
Ah yes , Professor Snape . 
- Master Snape ? 
- Do you still not understand ? 
This is how Snape helped protect the Stone , so he would not have stolen it ! 
Harry knew that Ron and Hermione were having the same thought . 
If Snape was in the Stone Guard group , he would more easily discover the ways other professors used to guard the Rock . 
Maybe he knows everything , except ( looks like ) , Quirrell's curse and how to get past the three - headed dog . 
Harry said impatiently to Hagrid : 
- Uncle is the only one who knows how to suppress Fluffy , is not it Hagrid ? 
And I promise never to tell anyone , okay ? 
Even professors , do not you say ? 
Said Hagrid , 
- No one can know except me and Dumbledore . 
Harry whispered to his two friends : 
- Well , that's fine . 
Then he told Hagrid : 
- Uncle , can I open the window a little ? 
I'm melting all the fat ! 
- Sorry , Harry ! 
Hagrid said as he stared at the fire in the fireplace , making Harry curious . 
- What is that , Hagrid ? 
But it already knew what that was . 
In the middle of the fire , below the kettle , is a large black egg . 
Elder Hagrid stiffened his beard : 
- That's it 
Ron approached the flames to see the egg better . 
" Where are you from , Hagrid ? " 
You must spend a lot of money to buy it , huh ? 
But Hagrid said , 
- Not a buy , but a win . In the other day , we went down to the village to make some three glasses and play some cards with strangers . 
He took the egg to bet , to be honest , I see he also seemed happy to get that for me . 
Hermione asked : 
- But what will you do once the egg hatches ? 
- Then we had to read some books 
He pulled out a large book from under his pillow . 
- I borrow this book in the library to refer to here - Raising dragons for entertainment and business - books are somewhat backward then , so only , but in this there are still basic guidelines . 
Look , let the eggs on fire , because mother dragons usually fade into the egg to see , when the eggs hatch , every half hour to give it a bucket of strong alcohol mixed with chicken . 
Here again How to distinguish different species of eggs Well , the egg that we have here is a descendant of the Great Black Horse . 
This is rare ! 
Hagrid seemed very pleased with himself . 
And Hermione did not . 
Speaking of incubation on the fire , she advised : 
- Uncle Hagrid , I live in a wooden house ! 
But Hagrid did not listen . 
He was screaming , delighted to sing alone . 
So three friends have an extra worry : If anyone knows Hagrid is hiding an illegal dragon in his bud , what will happen to him ? 
So , every day there are more exercises to do . 
Wrestling with a series of exercises from night to night , Ron gets bored : 
- Do not know how peaceful life is like ? 
Hermione began to prepare rehearsals for both Ron and Harry , causing them to go crazy . 
One morning , at breakfast , Hedwig gave Harry another letter from Hagrid . 
Letter only two words : is hatching . 
Ron ran away from the herbal course to run down the hut , but Hermione insisted . 
- Hermione Oh , how many times in my life have I considered dragon eggs ? 
- We have school hours . 
And if someone knew what Hagrid was doing , we would be in trouble . 
But our troubles will not penetrate where the disaster that Hagrid must suffer 
- Shut up , Hermione ! 
Harry whispered as Malfoy came a few steps away . 
He stood there in silence to listen ; I do not know how much it sneaks . 
Harry could not take Malfoy's look . 
On the way to Herbalism , Ron and Hermione argue , Hermione finally agreed to two boys running to Hagrid's hut at the time of play . 
When the bell rang at the end of the class , the three immediately let go of the shovel , hurried through the schoolyard toward the edge of the forest . 
Hagrid greeted them , looking very cheerful and nervous . 
They led them inside : 
- It's almost gone ! 
The egg is lying on the table . 
On the egg shell has a deep crack . 
Something inside is wiggling . 
It sounds funny to hear . 
People pulled chairs around the table , holding their breath . 
Suddenly there was a fence sounding like a scrape inside the eggshell , and the egg cracked . 
The baby dragon wandered on the table . 
It's a baby , but it's not pretty . 
Harry thought it was like a black parachute . 
Its jagged wings were too big for the bony body . 
The muzzle is too long with large nostrils , with orange - colored eyes , and hornless nubs , which make the head bumpy . 
He snorted . 
A few sparks came out from his muzzle . 
And Hagrid broached , 
- See it beautiful ? 
He patted the dragon's head . 
He sharpened his sharp fangs , tapped his fingers . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Look , he got it ! 
Hermione asked : 
- Uncle Hagrid , exactly how big Black Will grow ? 
Hagrid was about to reply suddenly suddenly . 
He stood up and ran to the window . 
- What's the matter , uncle ? 
- Someone stalked outside , he peeked through the crack of the curtain A little kid ran to school . 
Harry shot the door and looked around . 
Although the distance is quite far , it can not be wrong : 
So Malfoy saw the dragon . 
During the following week , Malfoy's face always had a faint smile , hiding something that Harry , Ron and Hermione were worried about . 
How much time is left , they spend all their time in the darkness of Hagrid's house , trying to persuade him . 
Harry pleaded : 
- Release it , Hagrid ! 
But Hagrid did not : 
- You can not do that . 
It's too small . 
It's dead ! 
They watch the dragon together . 
In just one week it has grown up , three times longer than before . 
Its nostrils flutter out the smoke . 
Hagrid also dabbled on the field guard duty because he was always busy with the dragon . 
On the floor of the house , bottles of spirits and chicken blood spilled all over . 
Hagrid looked at the dragon with dreamy eyes : 
- I decided to name it Norbert . 
Now he knows how to recognize me , really , hey . 
Norbert ! 
Norbert ! Where are you ? 
Ron whispered in Harry's ear : 
- He was crazy . 
Harry says loudly : 
- Uncle Hagrid . 
In two weeks Norbert would be as long as his house , unable to hide it anymore . 
And Malfoy can go to Dumbledore masters at any time . 
Hagrid bit his lip thinking : 
" I know I can not keep it forever , but I can not throw it away , can I ? 
How can we 
Harry suddenly turned to Ron , shouting : 
- Charlie ! 
Said Ron : 
- You also confused ? 
I'm Ron , do not you remember ? 
- No I do not say you , but your brother - Charlie's brother , a picture in Romania , is studying the dragon . 
We can send Norbert to the photo , thanks to take care of it until strong enough , then drop it back to nature . 
Ron shouted : 
- Clear all ! 
What do you think , Hagrid ? 
Hagrd eventually agrees to send the kid to Charlie to ask for his opinion of the dragon . 
Another week long , flickering in the swelling . On the fourth day , in the common room , there was only Hermione and Harry sitting side by side , long after everyone had gone to bed . 
The clock on the wall just knocked ten hours , the hole on the wall portrait suddenly opened . 
Ron emerged as suddenly from the floor as he removed Harry's stealth jacket . 
He had just come down to Hagrid's hut , helping him feed Norbert . 
This baby dragon now claims to eat dead mice and eat all the crimes . 
- It bites me too ! 
Ron shows you his hand wrapped in a bloody handkerchief . 
- Do not know how I can write in the next week ? 
Tell you , baby dragon is the most horrible animal I've ever met , but the way Hagrid treats it is as if it is a cute purebred pearl rabbit on the bow is not equal . ! 
She bites herself that Uncle Hagrid also told me to go away , do not scare him ! 
Then when he finished , he was singing lullaby sleep 
Suddenly there was a knock on the black window . 
- Hedwig . 
It probably brought Charlie's reply . 
Harry hurriedly opened the window for Hedwig to enter . 
Three children with their heads together read the letter : 
Ron loves you , 
How are you ? Thank you for writing to me . 
I'm glad to pick up Black Norbert , but bringing it here is not easy . 
He thinks the best way is to ask some of his friends to bring him along , because they will visit him next week . 
The most complicated thing is to make no one see them carrying an illegal dragon . 
Can you bring the dragon to the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday ? My friends will meet you there and bring the dragon away when it is dark . 
Please reply as soon as possible . 
Love you , 
Charlie . 
They look at each other . 
Harry said : 
- Having an invisibility cloak , this is not so hard . 
Hope the jacket is big enough to cover both of us and Norbert . 
Hermione and Ron agree with this plan right now , because the past few weeks have fluttered over the fact that the dragon baby has made the nerves so tired . 
Whoever offered any way to escape the dragon - and Malfoy - they all agreed to a rift . 
But there was a surprise . 
The next morning , Ron's hand was bitten by the dragon swollen swollen , large double hands normal . 
He does not know whether to go to see Pomfrey or not . Did you realize it was a dragon bite ? But by noon , he could barely breathe , no other way but to swing his arm swollen to the infirmary . 
The bite has turned green . 
It is possible that the dragon's fangs are venomous . 
Later that day , when Hermione and Harry rushed to the infirmary to visit Ron , the two met Ron in a catastrophic condition never seen before . 
Whispered Ron , 
" My hands hurt as it was about to fall , but the pain was not this way : Malfoy scolded Pomfrey for wanting to borrow a book . 
Then she laughed at him . 
He also threatened to reveal what he had bitten . I told Pomfrey the dog was biting me , but she probably did not believe I should not have beaten him in the Quidditch match the day before , now it is . to revenge yourself ! 
Harry and Hermione pound Ron . 
Hermione said : 
- After midnight on Saturday everything will be over . 
But that does not make Ron feel light , on the contrary , he sat up and sweat : 
- Midnight Saturday ? 
Alright ! 
Dead ! 
I remember that ! 
Charlie's letter was in Malfoy's book . 
He will know what he's going to send the dragon baby ! 
Harry and Hermione had not responded in time to the news that Pomfrey appeared at the right time to chase them out , saying Ron needed a break . 
Harry said Hermione's socks : 
- It's too late to change your plan . 
We have no time to send Charlie a shot . 
And I have no other chance to get rid of the dragon Norbert . Just take a dose . 
May but also invisibility cloak . 
Malfoy knows nothing of the secret . 
They went to find Hagrid to discuss , meeting Fang sitting outside the door with his tail wrapped in ice , and Hagrid just dared open the window to talk to them . 
Stomach breathing : 
- Uncle you can not enter . 
Baby Norbert is bothering her , she can not do it . 
When listening to the contents of Charlie's letter , the doctor's eyes . 
But also tears can be painful , at Norbert baby has just caught a love in his bed . 
- Ai ! 
Oh no ! 
He just hit his hosepipe shoes - that kid is that , after all , it's just a baby , are not you ? 
That newborn baby hit his tail on the wall of the shelter roar , causing the window to shake . 
Harry and Hermione returned to the castle , praying for Saturday night to come quickly . 
Just as Harry and Hermione did not see too much trouble caused by this young dragon , they were relieved by Hagrid's breakup with Norbert . The night was dark , as dark as the knob , Harry and Hermione came to him a little late for waiting for the Peeves goblin to leave the corridor leading to the door . 
The goblin stood there playing tennis against the wall . 
Hagrid placed Norbert in a large basket . 
He choked loudly : 
I packed enough rats and spirits for snacks along the way . 
I also have to put in a basket of teddy bears to pick up baby alone . 
From the sound of something that was rattling , almost white , that Harry sounded like a teddy bear tearing his stomach or tearing his head off . 
Hagrid did not stop the sobbing : 
- Goodbye , honey , Norbert . 
I will never forget you . 
Harry and Hermione hitched up the invisibility cloak on the basket , then covered them . 
The two of them did not know how to handle , carrying the large basket in the castle . 
Almost midnight they are still pushing the basket on the ladder 
marble , then dragged it in the corridor , then back up the stairs , then another stairs again . It's not as easy as Harry's shortcuts . 
Finally they reached the corridor below the tallest tower . 
Harry gasped : 
- Almost there ! 
Suddenly , a loud noise made them swoop , almost dropping the basket . 
Forgetting that I was invisible , the two of us panicked into the darkness , glaring at the small dim shadow that was scaly for a bigger shadow than grabbed . 
Both are just three meters away . 
A light flashed . 
That's Professor McGonagall in a gown and necktie that was pinching Malfoy's ear . 
The professor said : 
- Fine offense ! 
Except for Slytherin twenty points . 
Dare to wander in the castle at midnight ? 
- Auntie , you do not understand ! 
Harry Potter is coming here , it carries a dragon ! 
- Say hello ! 
Why do you dare to lie white ? 
Malfoy , I'm going to see Snape ! 
Professor McGonagall took Malfoy away , and Harry and Hermione saw the steep staircase leading up to the highest tower of the castle was not very high . 
As they reached their destination , they immediately stripped off their invisibility cloak to breathe freely into the cool night air . 
Hermione even dared to jump . 
- Malfoy is banned ! 
I love to sing it ! 
Harry advises : 
- do not 
The dragon was stirring in a basket . 
In the meantime , they laughed at Malfoy . 
About ten minutes later , from the sky , four brooms fell down in the dark . 
Charlie's friend is very funny . 
They let Harry and Hermione watch the reins and chains used to tame the dragon . 
Everyone gathered to tie the dragon in a neat way . 
Harry and Hermione shook hands with the guests , thanking them for their splitting and breaking up . 
After all , Baby Norbert departs . 
Harry and Hermione slid down the steep stairs , with no heavy baskets in their hands , their minds light and serene . 
No more worry about the dragon anymore . 
Malfoy was banned ! 
What could spoil the fun of the kids ? 
That is waiting at the bottom of the stairs . 
The two of them just reached down and touched the black iron of Filch 
- Okay . - Harry whispered , - we're gone . 
They left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower . 
Chapter 15 : PROHIBITED AREA 
There was nothing worse than that , said Filch , who took two young children to Professor McGonagall's office on the first floor . There they sat waiting and not saying a word to each other . 
Hermione shuddered , and Harry's mind was in turmoil , trying to make up for the excruciating reasons , fabulous stories , unbelievable apologies , and unreasonable offenses . I think the more reasonable . 
This time , Harry did not see any light at the end of the tunnel . 
Two children were cornered in the wall . 
How could they be so stupid to forget the invisibility cloak ? 
One reason for Professor McGonagall to accept the fact that they hid from sleep , sneaking around in the middle of the night , climbing to the top of the tower , a place of Restricted travel areas , only when new classes are allowed ? 
Norbert's inexplicable and invisibility cloak , they were only washed out of school . 
Harry thought of this country is nothing more tragic . 
But it was wrong . 
When Professor McGonagall appeared , she followed Neville . 
As soon as Harry and Hermione saw it , it cried out : 
- Harry ! 
I'm going to find you to tell you , I heard Malfoy say it will go catch you . 
She says you have a baby 
Harry shook his head and motioned Neville to shut his mouth , but Professor McGonagall saw it . 
She turned to look at the children , burning as if to breathe fire , looking even more horrible than the dragon Norbert : 
- I can not believe any of you dare to do this . 
Filch said the two climbed up the astronomical pyramid . 
One hour at a time . 
It was the first time Hermione could not answer a question the teacher raised . 
She stared down at her flat slippers , standing like a statue . 
Professor McGonagall continues : 
- I thought of the beginning of the story . 
Nor need to be genius to figure this out : the two fly to the nonsense story of a dragon for Draco Malfoy heard , to get him out of bed to trouble . 
And it's got trouble ! 
I've got it . 
I'm sure you guys have made a scene for Neville to hear your nonsense story , let it be the story of this , so we can laugh . 
Harry caught sight of Neville's eyes staring and hurt . 
He tried to use his eyes to tell Neville that it was not so . 
Poor boy Neville honestly . 
Harry knew that Neville had struggled to find the dark man in the dark , looking for them . 
Professor McGonagall leads : 
- Aghast ! 
Four students sleep in one night ! 
I have never seen it before ! 
Hermione , I thought you were the most conscious person ? 
And Harry , I also think you are the grader of the Gryffindor honor than these bullshit ! 
All three will be strictly prohibited Neville . 
No one can resort to any reason to wander in the castle at night , especially in these days , very dangerous Gryffindor minus fifty points . 
Harry gasped : 
- Fifty points ? 
- Yes , each is subtracted fifty points . 
Professor McGonagall breathed heavily through her long , sharp nose . 
Hold on to the top spot ! 
How many points by winning Quidditch to get lost now . 
- Dear her 
- Miss , you can not deduct 
- Do not say we can or can not do anything . 
Now , all about bed . 
We have never been as shy about Gryffindor students as this time . 
One hundred and fifty points lost . 
Gryffindor is down to last place . 
Only in one night we have dissipated the prospect of Gryffindor winning the Cup . 
Harry felt like his liver had fallen out of his stomach . 
How can he salvage Gryffindor ? 
That night Harry could not sleep . 
She listened to Neville sobbing on the pillow for a long time , it seemed like an hour . 
Harry could not think of anything to comfort Neville . 
He knew neville , now it was like it , thinking of the dawn that frightened . 
In the morning , how do all the Gryffindor members react when they know what they have done ? 
The next morning , as we walked through the huge sand - clocks that were used to score the homes , the Gryffindor thought it was a mistake at first . 
How do you suddenly lose a hundred and fifty internal points in one night ? 
But the story began to spread : Harry Potter ; That famous Harry Potter , the hero of the two Quidditch matches , lost all of Gryffindor . 
He , along with two other idiots of the first year . 
From being one of the school's most admired students , Harry became one of the haters . The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuff students also turned away without looking at it . 
No one is expecting the Slytherins to lose the Cup . 
Wherever Harry goes , people just point , even without lowering his voice to criticize it . 
On the contrary , when it passes by the Slytherin , they clap their hands , whistle , and cheer : 
- Thank you Harry ! 
We thank you for this phen ! 
Only Ron was with Harry : 
- In a few weeks they will forget all about this ! 
Fred's brother George had done for Gryffindor , but he's still loved by everyone ! 
- But the two of them never lost a hundred and fifty points at once , right ? 
Harry asked painfully , and Ron admitted : 
- Oh no . 
If you want to fix mistakes then it is too late . 
But Harry vowed to himself that from now on no one would stick his nonsense into his nonsense . 
From now on enough with the lurking around and stalking . 
He felt so ashamed of himself that he decided to meet Wood to withdraw from the Quidditch team . 
Wood rage storm : 
- Withdraw ? 
What are the benefits ? 
Let's just imagine , if we do not win the Quidditch match , will we get back to the missing spots ? 
But even at Quidditch , Harry was happy . 
Neither team would say anything to Harry during the rehearsal , but whenever there was a need to mention Harry , they did not call him Harry ; They just call it Tail . 
Hermione and Neville , of course , are also very distressed . 
They are not as bad as Harry , because they are not very famous . 
But no one wants to talk to them . 
Hermione stopped playing in the classroom , just dared to bow quietly studying . 
The exam was not far away , and Harry took that pleasure . 
Thanks to education , he forgot the tragedy . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione - still struggling to keep up with each other , stay up late at night , trying to remember complex formulas , memorize spells and curses , remember the date the magical discoveries and the goblins ' revolt 
Then , another week or so to the exam . 
Harry's determination not to be involved in anything unrelated to himself was suddenly harshly challenged : he was walking alone from the library to his room . 
Suddenly there was a croaking cry from the front hall . 
Harry stepped closer and realized that it was Quirrell's voice : 
- No , please do not do it again . 
It sounds as if someone is scaring Quirrell . 
Harry stepped closer . 
He heard Mr. Quirrell sobbing : 
- Okay . 
A second later , Quirrell hurried out of the classroom , fixing his scarf over his head . 
He looks pale and looks like he is about to cry . 
He hurried away from Harry's eyes . 
Maybe he did not notice it . Quirrell's footsteps distant , Harry poked his head into the classroom . 
The room was empty , but the back door was open . 
Harry walked over , halfway up the door , remembering the resolve of the other's nose . 
Still , Harry still dared to twelve . The Snake Stone had just left the room . 
And based on what he had just heard , Snape would have been dancing and dancing , because Quirrell had finally succumbed . 
Harry returned to the library , where Hermione was still examining Ron's Astronomy . 
Harry told the two of you what had happened . 
Said Ron : 
- So Snape was about to reach his goal . 
If Mr. Quirrell reveals to him how to solve the Dark Ants . 
Hermione said : 
- But still Fluffy guard ! 
Ron looked up at the thousands around him : 
Could Snape find out how to get past the monster without asking Hagrid ? 
There is also a book in this book that only manages to control a three - headed dog . 
So what should I do now , Harry ? 
The bloody adventure filled Ron's eyes . 
But Hermione answered quickly : 
- Go to Dumbledore . We must do this for a long time . 
Now that some of us are doing something else , we will be kicked out of school . 
Harry said : 
- But we have no proof . 
Quirrell was too frightened , unable to bear witness to us . 
Snape just said he did not know anything about the giant demon coming out of the dungeon on Ma's night , and he said it was not on the third floor ; At that time , you try to think people believe me or believe us ? 
We hate Snape , everyone knows . 
Dumbledore would have thought we'd make up just that for Snape's dismissal . 
Supervisor Filch does not help us any way , because it does not help you ? 
He was too close with Snape , and with more students being expelled , Filch loved it . 
And 
Do not forget this : We are not allowed to know about the Stone of the Witch or of the Fluffy . 
Back to explain more lengthy . 
Harry's analysis seems to convince Hermione , but Ron is not . 
- If only to explore around here . 
- Are not . 
Harry : We overhear this too much . 
He pulled the Jupiter map toward him and began to learn the names of the stars . 
At the breakfast table the following morning , Harry , Hermione and Neville received the same notice as follows : 
She will be performing her punishment at 11 o ' clock tonight . 
Meet Filch in the lobby . 
Professor McGonagall . 
Harry had forgotten that aside from the Gryffindor loss , they were also subject to a fine . 
He assumed that Hermione would complain that it was going to take an evening of papers , but Hermione did not say a word . 
Like Harry , she feels she deserves to be punished . 
That night , at 11 o ' clock , Harry and Hermione left Ron in the common room and went down to the hall with Neville . 
Filch was waiting there . 
There's Malfoy too . 
Harry forgot that Malfoy was punished as well . 
Filch lit a lamp and led the children out . 
He said : 
follow me . 
I assure you that later on , you will be more deliberate when breaking school rules . 
It is a pity that today people no longer use the same old punishment as tying their hands and hanging on the ceiling for a few days . term . 
In the office , we still have leashes and we still use grease to cover the room when needed . Well , let's go . 
Hey , do not have a chance to run away , just make it worse ! 
He led the children across the black school grounds , Neville suffered a runny nose , sniffing . 
Harry wondered what the punishment he was about to take . 
It must be terrible . 
Filch's joyful voice was known enough . 
Bright moon , but clumps of wandering clouds occasionally fly over cover the moon , causing everyone to go to the vase in the dark . 
Harry looked forward to seeing the warm light coming out of Hagrid's hut window . 
Then everyone heard a loud voice in the distance : 
- That teacher , Mr. Filch ? 
Hurry up . 
I want to start . 
Harry felt like dancing in his chest . 
If they had to work with Hagrid , it would not have been so bad . 
The joy of it must appear on the face , so Filch said : 
- The game is about to play with the old guy back then ? 
Hey , listen to the kid : you will have to work in the forest , then after that to be full , then be happy ! 
I quit ! 
Hearing that , Neville moaned a little , and Malfoy stood in the middle of the road . 
- Forest ? 
Malfoy repeated , his voice no longer as imperious as usual . 
- Can not get into the forest at night . There are all kinds of things in it I heard , there were wolves . 
Neville clutched Harry's sleeve , hiccuping one . 
Mr. Filch said , clear accent : 
- that's your fault , right ? 
Why do not you think about the werewolf ? 
Hagrid came out from the darkness , stepping closer , followed by Fang , the big hound . 
He carried a large bow and a basketful of names on his shoulders . 
He said , 
- It's late . 
I have waited here for half an hour . 
Are not you , Harry , Hermione ? 
Brother Filch coldly reminded : 
" I should not be so intimate with you , Hagrid ! 
They are punished anyway . 
Hagrid frowned at the supervisor Filch : 
- Is that so , you are late to Filch ? 
Teaching ethics with them is not finished yet ? That is not the task of the teacher . 
By the end of this part of the teacher , this place is my own . 
Mr. Filch said , his voice was wild : 
- In the early morning I will return , their relatives . 
Then he turned to go back to the castle , the lamp in his hand swinging in the shadow . 
Malfoy turned to Hagrid : 
- I do not go into that forest ! 
Harry was delighted to hear his voice had a terrible fear . 
Said Hagrid . 
- If you want to continue studying at Hogwarts , you have to go . 
You have to bother to pay for doing that . 
- But this is the work of the servant , not of the students . 
I think we just have to do penalties or something like that . 
If my father knew that I was being arrested , he would 
- for games to know , Hogwarts is so it ! Said Hagrid coldly . 
Copy penalty ! 
Who would benefit from punishment ? 
You have to redeem it with something useful , otherwise the game will be fired . 
If you think your father does not want to , but rather want to pursue a job , go back to the castle and pack it up . go ! go ! 
Malfoy did not budge . 
He looked at Hagrid in an extremely angry way , but then he fell face down . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Then , okay , listen carefully : Because the work we are going to do tonight is very dangerous , but we do not want anyone to risk it , so we fly with us here for a while . . 
He led the children to the edge of the forest . 
Raising the lamp in his hand , Hagrid showed the children a narrow , winding road , hidden behind a thick , shrubbery grove . 
Children look at the forest deep . 
A light breeze passed through the hair on the head . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Look ! 
See what glitters on the ground ? 
The silver shine . that is bloody code . 
In the forest there was a codey bird badly injured . This is the second time in a week . 
On Wednesday I discovered a dead child . 
We will have to find that poor animal . 
May help it escape the catastrophic fate like the other . 
Malfoy asked , unable to hide the fear in his voice : 
- But what if the one that killed the unicorn back attacked us first ? 
Said Hagrid . 
- If the game follows me , or if there is a Fang beside him , no animal in the forest can harm him . 
And do not go out of the way . OK . 
Now we divide into two groups and go in opposite directions . 
There was blood everywhere , and probably the animal was hanging around , at least from the night before . 
Malfoy looked at Fang's sharp white teeth , saying quickly : 
- I go with Fang . 
- okay . 
But I tell you , it is a shame . 
Then , Harry , Hermione will go in one direction ; Malfoy , Neville and Fang will go the other direction . 
If anyone found the previous code will emit blue light to report , okay ? 
Take your wand off and practice it , so that's it . If anyone has an accident or a problem , then throw a red light , we ' ll all run to help . 
The forest is black and empty . 
They walked for a while to the fork , the Hagrid group , Harry and Hermione turn left ; Malfoy , Neville and Fang follow the right path . 
With their eyes fixed on the ground , they walked in silence . 
Sometimes the moonlight through the branches above shine a silver puddle of blood on the leaves . 
Harry noticed that Hagrid seemed worried . 
She asked : 
- Is there ever a werewolf kill some white code ? 
Said Hagrid . 
- The werewolf is not so fast . Where can easily catch a code ? 
They are powerful and very mysterious creatures . 
We have never heard of such a murderous code ever before . 
They walked around a moss - covered tree . 
Harry heard the sound of running water , probably a stream nearby . 
Along the winding road sometimes see the bloody white code . 
Asked Hagrid , 
- Hermione , are you okay ? Do not worry , it's so bad that you do not go far , we find it right then it can be Ê ! AVOID THE ORIGINAL PLANTS ! 
Hagrid grabbed Harry and Hermione , dragging them behind a tall oak tree . 
He drew an arrow , placed it on the spear , held it up , ready to let go . 
They listened quietly . 
Something was crawling on dry leaves nearby : it sounded like a long cloak on the ground . 
Mr. Hagrid stared out the dark path , but only a few seconds later , the noise began to fade , Hagrid whispered : 
- I know There's something here but it's not here . 
Harry guessed : 
- Are you a wolf ? 
Hagrid suddenly burst out : 
- There were no werewolves , nor was there any unicorn . 
Well , follow me , now be careful there ! 
They slow down , ears start to listen , do not miss any weak noises . Suddenly the crowd heard the front , obviously the sound of what was moving . 
" Hagrid shouted . 
- Who's that ? 
Let's go We have weapons ! 
And in front of them appeared a creature , not known to be a man or a horse : From the waist up , it was a human with red beard ; But from the waist down is a horse with a slim chestnut and long red tail . 
Harry and Hermione gasped and stared at each other . 
Hagrid sighed : 
- Turn it off , Ronan ! 
Is not it ? 
He walked over to shake hands with the centaur . Ronan said , 
Hello , Hagrid . 
Do you shoot me ? 
The voice of this centaur sounds deeply sad . 
Hagrid patted the bow and said , 
Anyway , be careful , Ronan . There is something wrong in the forest . 
By the way , this is Harry Potter and Hermione Granger . 
Student of school . 
And this is Ronan . 
He is a centaur . 
Said Hermione weakly : 
- I see 
Ronan said : 
- Hello . 
Are you a student ? 
Have you learned a lot in school ? 
- Mm , Harry hummed . 
Hermione replied sheepishly : 
- A little bit . 
Ronan sighed , leaning his head back , looking up into the sky : 
- A little . 
Oh , that's okay . Martian tonight too bright . 
Hagrid glanced up at the sky , answering : 
- Ừ . 
Listen , Ronan , I'm glad to meet you here , because it looks like there's a bug in the forest . Do you see anything strange ? 
Ronan did not reply right away . 
He looked up at the sky without blinking , then sighed again . 
Finally it says : 
- Innocents are always the first victims . life is still , how many times , and now still . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Ừ . 
But do you see anything suspicious ? 
What's wrong ? 
Ronan repeated : 
- Mars is too bright tonight . 
Illuminated abnormally . 
Hagrid looked impatiently at the centaur : 
- Ừ . 
But I want to say something unusual on the ground . 
You do not notice anything strange ? 
Again , Ronan did not reply immediately . 
Finally it says : 
- The forest hide many secrets . 
Something green in the bush behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow , but it was only a centaur . 
The second one is black hair , black body , and looks wilder than Ronan . 
Said Hagrid . 
- Hi Bane . 
Is not it ? 
Hello , Hagrid . 
I hope you are well ? 
- Deadly . 
Well , I just asked Ronan , do you see anything unusual in the woods recently ? 
Is there a white bug that hurt you know anything about it ? 
Bane walks up to Ronan . 
He looked up at the sky . 
Then just say : 
- Mars is so bright . 
Hagrid spat : 
- I heard . 
Well , if any of you have seen something strange tell me . 
We have to go . 
Harry and Hermione followed Hagrid out of the empty field . 
They both turned and looked at Bane and Ronan until the trees obscured the view . 
Hagrid snapped . 
- Never get a straight answer from the centaurs . 
The stars watching the epidemic ! 
Do not care about anything closer to the moon ! 
Hermione asked : 
- There are many centaurs here ? 
Oh , some of them , but most of them just go around in their circles . 
If we want to talk , they are kind . 
In fact , they are deep - centipedes who know a lot but do not reveal much . 
Harry asked : 
" Do you think the sound that I heard at the beginning , is also of a centaur ? 
- Do you hear the sound of horse hooves ? 
Are not . I ask you to tell me . 
I think it was the killer of the code . We have not heard anything like it before . 
They continued through the dense woods , dark . 
Harry looked anxiously backwards . 
It has a feeling of groan that is being monitored . 
He was also glad to have Hagrid and his neighbor's bow . 
But as they walked through the path of the path , Hermione clutched Hagrid's arms and exclaimed , 
- Uncle Hagrid ! 
Look ! 
Red light , the other victims ! 
Hagrid shouted . 
- You wait here ! stay on the path . 
I will come back soon . 
Harry and Hermione heard the old Hagrid screaming for help . 
They looked at each other so frightened that they heard nothing but the rustling of the leaves . 
Whispered Hermione : 
- Do you think they are okay ? 
- Someday , take care of Malfoy . 
But what if Neville had something to say ? Well , let's just say , it's just us that it's fine . 
A minute or so passed slowly . 
Two ears are up , hearing more often than usual . 
Harry seemed to hear the sound of the breath , the small fluttering trees . 
What is happening ? 
Where are the others ? 
At last , the sound of footsteps and grunts said that old Hagrid had returned . with Malfoy , Neville and Fang . 
Hagrid is getting mad . 
Looks like Malfoy hid behind Neville , then grabbed the boy play , Neville panic , then immediately signal for help . 
Hagrid yelled : 
- What do you like to catch the monkey again ? 
Neville , I stay with Hermione and you . 
Harry was with Fang and the other idiot . 
He said in a low voice Harry : 
" I do not want to , but to me Malfoy is hardly a threat , and tonight we have to finish work . " 
So Harry went into the woods with Malfoy and Fang . 
They walked for half an hour , getting deeper into the depths , until the path was covered by shaggy trees , almost impossible to go on . 
Harry felt like blood in his throat : on the roots of a tree , there were streaks , as if nearer the wretched creature was grinding in pain . 
Through the trunk of an old oak , Harry could see a gap in front . 
She held Malfoy's hand for a pause and whispered : 
- Look ! 
There is something bright white on the ground . 
They move closer to see clearly . 
It was a codeine , and was dead . 
Harry has never seen such a beautiful thing that so sad . 
Its legs are long , slender , folded to curl when falling , pearl white mottled on the black leaves . 
Harry had just stepped one foot ahead and something crawled up to make him frozen in place . 
A bush on the edge of the void . Then , out of the darkness , a shadow of a cowboy crawling on the ground like a beast crawling around . 
Harry , Malfoy and Fang stood as if empty . 
The cloak was crawling to the side of the statue , he bent his head down to the wounds on the beast , and began to suck blood . 
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Malfoy screamed and then ran as fast as an arrow . 
Fang also ran . 
The shadow of the head lifted up and looked directly at Harry - the bloody whip dripping down his face . 
He got up and walked quickly toward Harry . 
He was so scared he could not move . 
Then a sickle that Harry had never before penetrated into his head . It hurts as if the scar on the forehead is on fire . 
The eyes were almost blind , Harry jerked back . 
Suddenly , it sounded like a horseshoe , behind him , galloping , and something slammed over Harry , dashing into the shadow . 
The pain in Harry's head was so horrible that he could not stand . 
Harry fell down . 
A minute or two passed . 
As she looked up , the shadow had disappeared . 
Instead there is a centaur standing nearby , but not Ronan or Bane . 
This centimeter looks younger , with platinum blond hair and blond body . 
- Are you alright ? 
Harry stood up , asked kindly . 
Harry is not complete yet : 
- Thank you What is that ? 
The centaur does not answer . 
It has strange blue eyes , as blue as the jade . 
Harry stared at Harry , his gaze fixed on Harry's forehead . 
The centaur says : 
- You are the Potter child ? 
Hurry back to Hagrid . 
Now the forest is not a safe place - especially for you . 
Do you know how to ride a horse ? Let me carry you faster . 
The hippopotamus divides his lower limbs so that Harry can climb to his back . 
Then he added : 
- My name is Firenze . 
Suddenly , there were many horses from one side of the clearing . Ronan and Bane brushed through the bushes , their hips fluttering and sweating . 
Bane screamed like thunder : 
- Firenze ! 
What are you doing ? 
I carry a human on my back ! 
I do not know shame ha ? 
Have you become a mundane mahjong ? 
Firenze answers : 
- You do not recognize anyone here ? This is the Potter child . 
It must leave this forest as quickly as possible . 
Bane grumble : 
- What did you say to him ? 
Firenze , remember : We swore we are not against Heaven . 
Did not we foresee what will happen through the movement of planets ? 
Ronan knocked his nails to the ground impatiently , speaking in a gloomy voice : 
" You must be convinced that Firenze is acting for the best of it . 
Bane upset after back kick : 
- For the best ! 
What does that have to do with us ? 
Centipede should only care about the prophecies ! 
Our job is not to run around like donkeys stalking stray people into the woods ! 
Firenze shouted at Bane : 
- Do you see the code ? 
Do you understand why it was killed ? 
Or do the planets do not allow you to stick to the secret ? 
Brother Bane , you allow yourself to be against what is hiding in this forest . 
Yes , if you have to do that , you will work with people . 
And Firenze turned around and took on Harry who was trying his best to hold on to his back . 
He leaves the woods , leaving Ronan and Bane behind . 
Harry did not understand what was going on . 
She asked : 
- Why are you angry Bane ? 
And what did you save me from ? 
Firenze slows down , only to slow down . 
He told Harry to lower his head to avoid the branches . 
But he did not answer Harry's question . 
Both walked through the woods in silence , so long that Harry thought that Firenze would not talk to him anymore . 
However , as the two passed through a special wooded area , Firenze stopped abruptly . 
- Harry Potter , do you know what bloody white code to do ? 
Harry was so surprised at the question , he said , 
- Are not . 
We only use horn and caudal peduncle in the poison 
Firenze says : 
- Because killing a coyote is an extremely cruel task . 
Only those who have nothing to lose , and want to spend all , to commit such a crime . 
The blood of the hordes will keep him alive , even though death is near . 
But that person will live on a terrible price . 
He killed a pure creature without self - defense , only to save his life , but he could only live on - a cursed life , since his lips touched the white blood . code . 
Harry stared at Firenze's neck , his neck gleaming in the moonlight . 
She spoke up questions in her heart : 
- But who is so desperate ? 
If it is cursed for life , it is better to die . 
Firenze agrees : 
- right . 
Except he has to live up to the day he drinks something else - something that can give him enough strength and power - something that will never let him die . 
Harry Potter , do you know what is being kept at school now ? 
- Of course I know : The Stone of the Witch ! 
But I do not understand anyone . 
- You did not think of the person who had waited so much this year to regain power , who clings to life to wait for his chance ? 
As if an iron hand suddenly suffocate Harry's heart . 
It suddenly sounded like somewhere on the rustle of trees the words Hagrid told him the first night they met : 
- Someone said he was dead . 
According to him , he just got burned in the fire only . 
Who knows he has enough human to die or not ? 
Harry opened his mouth , but his words were clenched in his throat : 
- Are you referring to Vol 
- Harry ! 
Harry ! Are you OK ? 
Hermione was running towards them on the trail . 
Hagrid rushed behind her . 
Harry yelled , almost not realizing what he was saying : 
- I'm okay . 
No problem . 
The code is dead . 
Hagrid , it's in the forest here . 
Hagrid hurried to check the horn , Firenze whispered to Harry : 
- My brother broke up here , now I'm safe . 
Harry walks off Firenze . 
I said : 
- Good luck , Harry Potter . 
In the past , there were also planets that were misinterpreted , even by the centaurs themselves . 
I hope this time the same . 
Firenze turned and fluttered into the depths of the forest , leaving Harry standing trembling . 
Ron sat waiting for his friends to come back to sleep in the common room . 
She sleeps , screaming Quidditch , and Harry shakes him up . 
Even so , a few seconds later , Ron was alert , and Harry and Hermione talked about what had happened in the woods . 
Harry could not sit still . 
He walked by the fire , still trembling : 
- Snape wants to get the Witch Stone for Voldemort Voldemort waiting in the forest so I thought he just wanted to get rich . 
Ron whispered in horror , as if afraid Voldemort could hear them : 
- do not say that name ! 
But Harry did not hear : 
- Brother Firenze saved me , I should not have done so Bane was angry . The picture was so interrupted by the things that the planets prophesied . These planets must have shown beforehand that one day Voldemort would Back to England , Bane thought that Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me . It must have been written on the planets too ! 
Ron resumed : 
- Please do not say that name again . 
Harry continued , his face flushed red : 
- Now I just waited until Snape stole the stone , and Voldemort came and took my life . Well , it must have been Bane's pleasure . 
Hermione looked extremely frightened , but she also tried to say a few words of comfort : 
- Harry , everyone says Dumbledore is the only one Who - who - knows - knows - who's abstinent . Being with Dumbledore , you do not worry about who - who - also - knows - who - harmed . 
Anyway , who dares to be sure of the centaurs is right ? 
I think the fortune sweeps the house to scare it ; And Professor McGonagall also said that divination is the most inaccurate branch of the magic . 
Until it was dawn , three children stopped the story . 
They went to bed in complete exhaustion , their throats swollen in pain . 
But a night full of strange things is not over yet : 
As Harry pulled out the sheets , he saw his invisibility cloak folded neatly on the mattress . 
There is a piece of paper on the shirt , recording : Room when needed . 
Chapter 16 : Scrabble 
It was not until later that Harry could remember what he had done , and eventually he would still be able to pass the exam , and Voldemort would burst into the room at any moment . 
But day after day , the Fluffy was still alive , still guarding the locked door on the third floor . 
Taking the children to write the test , the weather is very hot , especially in the large classrooms where they are sitting . To do this , students are given new , special goose quilts , which have been casted against Anti - Fraud - Examination . 
Students also have to practice . 
Professor Flitwick called one by one into class to see if they could make a jelly ball dance through a desk . 
Professor McGonagall observed the children turning the rats into cigarette cases . Points are given according to the box pretty bad , boxes with beards are eliminated . 
And Professor Snape standing behind them made them so nervous as to try to remember how to make the drug . 
Harry tried his best , despite the stabbing pain that hit his forehead , which often tormented him from his return trip . 
Neville thought Harry was too anxious about examinations without sleep . 
But it was true that Harry had been awakened by nightmares , before , but now it was worse because of the cluttered , bloody wandering of his dreams . 
Perhaps because he had never seen what Harry had seen in the forest , perhaps because of the scar on his forehead , Ron and Hermione did not seem to be as nervous as Harry about the Stone of the Witch . 
Surely thinking of Voldemort alone is enough to make them scare , but Voldemort never creeps into their dreams . 
Besides , they were so busy studying their exams that they did not have much free time to worry about Snape or anyone else planning or pursuing something . 
The last of the children is the History of Magic . 
It only takes an hour to answer questions about the wicked sorcerers who invented the stirrings that will free themselves for a week . wonderful ceremony , until the contest results . 
So , when the ghost of Professor Binns ordered the children to drop goose down and roll the parchment to submit , Harry , like all the other children , could not hold back the cheers . 
Entering the crowd over the sunny schoolyard , Hermione said to her friends : 
- It's easier than you think . 
I should not have had to learn about the Wolfman's Code of Conduct in 1637 or the Elfric Insurrection . 
Hermione always wanted to review the finished work , but Ron said it only made him sick . 
So they went to the lake and stretched themselves under the trees . 
The Weasley and Lee Jordan brothers are ticking the tentacles of a giant squid hidden in a warm puddle . 
Ron lay on the grass , happy to breathe . 
- No more paper , you have to be happy , Harry . 
A week later I know how bad my exams are , at that time it was not too late ; Now that's a little worried ! 
Harry was squatting his forehead . 
It suddenly filled with anger : 
- What does this mean , why do not I know ? 
My scar kept hurting It can be painful , but it never hurts ! 
Hermione suggested : 
- You go to Mrs. Pomfrey ! 
- I'm not sick ! 
I believe this is definitely a warning , meaning that disaster is approaching 
It was so hot Ron did not think further : 
- Relax Harry . 
Hermione was right , as long as Dumbledore was around , the Stone was still intact , do not worry . 
Again , look what Snape has found out how to overcome the three - headed dog . 
I used to bite him almost broke , he probably did not rush to try again . 
And Hagrid was no way to disappoint Dumbledore , which made it even harder for Neville to become Quidditch nationalist ! 
Harry agreed , but he could not get rid of the vague feeling that he was forgetting to do something , something important . 
When he tried to explain this , Hermione said , 
- At that exam . 
Me too . 
Late at night , I wake up , review half of the Transfiguration and then remembered that already finished the subject . 
Harry , however , remained convinced that the unsettling feeling in his heart had nothing to do with the examination . 
He saw an owl flying across the bright blue sky above the school - the owl snapped a letter . 
The only person ever to send a letter to Harry was Hagrid . 
He never betrayed Dumbledore . 
He does not tell me how to get through the Fluffy 
Harry suddenly stood up . 
Asked Ron , 
- Where are you ? 
Harry's face became white : 
- I just thought of something . 
Go to see Hagrid right now ! 
Hermione hurried up to her feet , nervously : 
- to spend ? 
Harry crawled on the gentle grass : 
- Are not you surprised ? 
Hagrid wished there was a dragon more than anything else , and the stranger he met at the barge randomly had a dragon egg in his pocket . 
The dragon is illegal , who wanders here with a dragon eggs in the bag ? 
You think he happened to see Hagrid , or ? 
Why do not you think of this soon ? 
- What are you talking about ? 
Ron asked , but Harry did not answer , plugging his neck through the schoolyard toward the edge of the forest . 
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair set outside the hut , his sleeves and trousers all rolled up . 
He was peaking in a big one , smiling as he saw the young boy running . 
- Good morning ! 
Finished ? 
Drink tea ? 
Ron replied : 
- Yes , please . 
But Harry interrupted Ron : 
- No , we're in a hurry . 
Hagrid , I ' ll answer you this . 
Do you remember the day that you beat the egg black dragon ? 
Do not you remember that stranger ? 
Hagrid calmly : 
- Are not . 
Where he left the shirt ! 
The three children stood up with a puzzled look on Hagrid's face : 
- What's wrong ? At the pub Heo - the pub in the village - there are a bunch of monsters Maybe he is a dragon smuggling . 
Unable to see his face , he always pulled his hooded hood . 
Harry sat down beside the bowl : 
" What did you say to Uncle Hagrid ? " 
Do you mention Hogwarts ? 
Uncle Hagrid frowned trying to remember : 
- let us remember Ờ he asked me what to do , i said i was the keeper of this place he asked me about the things that i liked so i told him i said what i wished was a baby And then I do not remember very well , because he kept buying more wine to see me drink , and then he said he has a dragon egg , if I want to be able to play with him but he wants to know Do you want to keep a dragon ? 
He did not want it to fall into the ordinary hands . I told him that once I had tamed the Fluffy , teaching a dragon was easy . 
Harry tried to keep his voice low , 
- And then did he pay attention to Fluffy ? 
- Oh , yes ! 
In this life have three dogs head ? 
Even here in Hogwarts is not easy to meet . Then I tell him , Fluffy is really cute if I know how to coax it , just let it hear a melodious song that rolls out right there . 
Suddenly , Hagrid jumped in shock : 
- death grave 
I should not have told you ! Well , forget it all home ! HEY ! Where are you flying ? 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione rushed towards the castle , no one told anyone until the three of them reached the lobby . 
The castle is cooler than the yard . 
Harry said : 
- We have to tell Dumbledore immediately . 
Hagrid had told the stranger that he was in control of Fluffy , and the man in that suit , if not Snape , was Voldemort . 
Once he made Hagrid drunk , it was easy to exploit him , just hope Dumbledore believed us . 
Firenze can stand for Bane without him . 
Where is Dumbledore's office ? 
The three looked around , as if hoping to find a sign that would guide them in the right direction . 
They never heard anyone say where Dumbledore lived , nor did he ever call them up in the office . 
- We have to 
Harry did not say the end of the sentence , a voice suddenly rang from across the Hall : 
- What are you doing here ? 
That's Professor McGonagall , she's holding a pile of books . 
Hermione was brave at the time ( according to Harry and Ron ) , she said straight : 
- We want to see Dumbledore . 
Professor McGonagall repeated : 
- Meet Dumbledore ? for what ? 
The professor's voice was as if she expected the kids were going to do something very subtle . 
Harry swallowed . 
What should I say now ? 
- Yes , this is a secret 
At the word of mouth Harry remorse , because Professor McGonagall raised his nose , she coldly said : 
- Professor Dumbledore was away ten minutes ago . 
You received a frog from the French Minister and immediately flew to London . 
Harry sheds his head : 
- Have you gone ? this time ? 
- Professor Dumbledore is a great magician , Harry , the time of the very rare . 
- But this is very important 
" What do you mean , what's more important to the Minister of Magic , Harry ? " 
Harry threw away his cautiousness . 
- You talk about the Stone of the Witch 
That was so unexpected to Professor McGonagall that she let go of her hand , so that the books fell to the floor without even picking them up . 
She stammered : 
- How do you know ? 
- Sir , I think you know that Master Sn is someone trying to steal the Stone . 
You have to tell Dumbledore . 
The professor looked at Harry with both panicked and suspicious eyes . 
Finally she said : 
- Professor Dumbledore returned home tomorrow . 
I do not know how you discover the stone , but rest assured , no one can steal it , it is kept very carefully . 
- But , ma ' am 
" Harry , you know what you're talking about ! 
Bending down to pick up the books , Professor McGonagall concludes concisely : 
- You go out in the yard and sunbathe for warmth . 
But children are not interested in sunshine or warmth . 
When Professor McGonagall was away , Harry said , 
- This evening Snape will reach the door tonight . 
He had everything he needed , and now he had tricked Dumbledore away . 
The old man sent the owl . 
I'm sure the Magic Minister would be surprised to see Dumbledore come . 
- But now what can we do ? 
Hermione gasped , and Harry and Ron went around like a spinning wheel . 
Suddenly they realized that Snape was standing there . 
He said quietly : 
- Welcome ! 
The three of them looked at him as if hypnotized . 
He smiled mysteriously distorted smile : 
- Good day today , we should not be in the house . 
- We 
Harry opened his mouth and did not know what to say . 
Snape went on to say , 
- You have to be careful . 
Hanging like this , people think that we are flying something . 
The Gryffindor house is not much left to lose ! 
Harry rose , She turned away , walked out . 
But Snape called back : 
" Harry , I warn you . If there's any croaking in the night , I'm sure the chase will be strong . 
Have a good day . 
He walked to the teacher's room . 
Step down from the stone steps . 
Harry returned with a sudden whisper to his two friends : 
" Yes , this is what we have to do : one of us must follow Snape . Waiting outside the teacher's room , the old guard went out to follow . 
Hermione , you do this best . 
- Why me ? 
Said Ron : 
It's easy to understand : You pretend to be Flitwick , you know how : Oh , Flitwick , I'm worried . 
I'm afraid I made wrong answer 14 . 
Ron's impish voice made Hermione shout : 
- Shut up ! 
Even so , Hermione agreed to follow Snape . 
Harry asked Ron : 
- And the two of us , the third floor corridor . hurry up ! 
But they could not finish the task . 
They just came to the door to stop the Fluffy dog ​​ from the rest of the school , and Professor McGonagall came back , and this time she lost her temper when she saw the two children . 
She was embarrassed : 
- We see them flying harder than a spell . 
Just right ! 
I also heard we fly around recently , I will minus the Gryffindor dozen points . 
Well , except for the house that I own ! 
Harry and Ron returned to the common room . 
He just said , 
- May Hermione grasp Snape's tail 
Mrs. Beo's portrait slipped aside for Hermione . 
Little girl : 
- Sorry , Harry ! 
Snape went out of the teacher's room , saw me , asked what I was doing , I said I was waiting for Flitwick , so Snape came in and called Flitwick . 
I did not know where Snape went . 
Harry said : 
- So it's time , right ? 
The other two looked at him . 
Harry's face was bright but his eyes were glittering : 
- I'm leaving this place tonight , I ' ll go get the stone first . 
Shouted Ron : 
- Bo ? 
Hermione can : 
- You do not have to fool ! 
Are not Snape and Professor McGonagall talking ? 
You will be kicked out ! 
Harry screamed : 
- SO WHAT ? 
Do you have any knowledge ? 
If Snape gets the Stone , Voldemort will be revived ! 
Have you ever heard of how Voldemort dominated ? E no Hogwarts school to study it ! 
That wicked witch is going to level it all , or turn it into a school of Dark Arts ! 
Now we lose more emulation points too . 
Do you think Gryffindor won the Cup ? Did you and your family get Voldemort ? 
If I was arrested before getting the Stone , well , well , I went back to Dursley's house and sat there waiting for Voldemort to come over ! 
I just died a little slower , but no life to follow the dark side . 
I will go through that trapdoor tonight , what you two say can not stop me . 
Voldemort killed my parents , do not you remember ? 
Harry's eyes glittered . 
Said Hermione , 
- You're right . 
Harry said : 
- I will wear invisibility cloak . 
Luckily I got my coat back . 
Asked Ron : 
- But the coat cover all three ? 
- All three of us ? 
- Why ? 
Do you think we let you go alone ? 
Hermione looked up excitedly : 
- Of course you can not get the stone without our help . Let me reconsider my books , sometimes find out what the use may be . 
- But if you are arrested , you will be expelled . 
Hermione grinned . 
- I'm not trying to get caught , it's not being fired . 
Mr. Flitwick revealed to me that I had achieved one hundred and twenty points out of a hundred in the exam . 
With that score , people do not get me fired . 
After dinner , Harry , Ron , and Hermione sit still in the same room . 
No one interrupts them , Gryffindor students have nothing to say to Harry . This was the first night that it did not hurt . 
Hermione is buried in her little book , hoping to find a way to explain the tales that they might be having . 
Harry and Ron did not say much . 
Both are thinking about what they are about to do . 
The other students went to bed , empty room . 
When Lee Jordan finally reached out to yawn and fall asleep , Ron whispered to Harry : 
- go get the invisibility cloak ! 
Harry ran to his dark bedroom , pulled out his invisibility cloak , and then he suddenly saw the flute Hagrid donated to Christmas . 
Harry put the flute in his pocket for a while to blow up the fluff . Fluffy : He did not know his voice was good enough to sing to the three - headed dog . 
Then he ran down the common room . 
- We clad invisible cloak here , boss to cover all three home ! 
If supervisor Filch naturally see our legs wandering 
- What are you doing ? 
A voice echoed from the corner , and Neville appeared from behind an armchair , holding Trevor's toad . 
The wretched animal looks like he has risked his freedom once more . 
Harry hastily hides his jacket behind his back : 
- Where are you going , Neville ? 
But Neville stared at the suspiciously guilty faces . 
- Are you back to sleep again ? 
Hermione shook her head and shook her head . 
- no ! no ! 
We do not dare so . 
Why do not you go to sleep ? 
Harry looked at the ancient wooden clock that had been set up near the door . 
Perhaps now Snape is lulling Fluffy to sleep , the three of them have no time to waste anymore . And yet Neville stayed there tickling : 
- You can not go out . 
You will be arrested again for that . 
The Gryffindor House is even worse . 
Harry tried to explain : 
- You do not understand Neville , this is very important . 
Neville is obviously doing something hopeless . 
It hastily stood before the hole portraits Mrs. Beo : 
- I will not let you do that . 
I will fight you back . 
Ron stunned : 
- Neville , get out of that hole , do not act like an idiot ! 
- You dare call me idiot ? 
I see you should not violate the rules anymore . 
And you are the one who told me to fight ! 
Ron more crazy : 
- Yes , but not with us , Neville , you do not understand what you're doing ! 
Ron walked one step ahead , Neville let go of Trevor and one of them , the toad jumped away . 
Neville raised his hand and said , 
- Then come , let's just try it ! 
I'm ready now ! 
Harry turned to Hermione , desperately saying : 
- What to do ! 
Hermione stepped forward , saying : 
- Neville , I really , really do not want to do this 
She raised her wand , pointing to Neville , reading the mantra : 
- Petrificus Totalus . 
Neville's arms were immediately attached to the hips , his legs twisted together , his body stiffened . 
He stood swinging in place , then rolled back , face down on the floor , stark like a board . 
Hermione ran up to her face , but Neville's jaws were twisted and it could not speak . 
Only his eyes can be moved to express the horror . 
Harry whispered : 
- What did you do to Neville ? 
Hermione answered , 
- that is Trí - body - absolute . 
Sorry , Neville . 
Harry comforted : 
" We have to do that , not the time to explain it , Neville . " 
Ron added : 
- You will understand later . 
I walked over to Neville , pulling on an invisible cloak over the crowd . 
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor is not a good thing . 
Because in the state of tension , the three youngsters felt the silhouette of every statue seemed like Filch , every breeze from afar made them feel like their beloved Peeves were falling on their heads . 
At the foot of the first stairway , they meet Mrs. Norris , who is lurking near the top of the stairs . 
Ron whispered into Harry's ear : 
- Oh , let's kick him one , only this time . 
But Harry shook his head . 
They climb up the stairs , carefully circling the cat . 
Miss Norris turned her eyes on them , but only that , no more . 
They did not meet anyone else until they reached the stairs leading up to the third floor . There , I love the Peeves dancing in the middle of the stairs , to cut the carpet to let others slip play . 
As they began to climb , Peeves suddenly asked : 
- Who's that ? 
Then I love my narrow black eyes : 
- Even if I do not see you , I know you are there ! Are you a ghost , a demon , or a monster ? 
I love to fly up and hovering in the air , squinting glance at the words : 
" Master Filch , I tell you , Filch , there is something crawling around without a shadow ? 
Harry suddenly turned a thought , he said with a harsh voice , said : 
- Peeves , Barbarian if there is invisibility is also a reason 
Peeves almost fell from the air to the ground in panic . 
He picked himself up in time and lifted up hoist above the stairs about three feet . 
My sweet voice now sounds sweet : 
" Sorry , Baroness , you barbarian , that's my fault , you're wrong , I did not see you . Of course you did not see me , you invisible , begging him to forgive old Peeves . You fool , please . 
Harry fake hoarse voice : 
- Peeves , we have business here , stay away from this place tonight . 
- Yes , sir , I will definitely stay away ! 
I love to fly again and again , and before you go , it says : 
- Yes , Barbarian , I hope your work is going well . 
Dear Baron , I would not dare to disturb you again . 
Ron whispered : 
- Harry , good job ! 
Seconds later , the children arrived - outside the third floor corridor . 
The door was open . 
Harry whispered , 
- that , see ? 
Snape passed me by Fluffy ! 
In some ways , seeing open doors works well : it touches three children about the danger they are facing . 
Under the invisibility cloak , Harry returned to the two friends : 
- If you want to return , go back , I do not blame . 
You keep the invisibility cloak , now I do not need it anymore . 
Said Ron : 
- do not be stupid 
Hermione also argued : 
- We go with you ! 
Harry pushed open the door . 
When the door whistled , they heard the growl of the dog . 
Fluffy's three pairs of noses squealed like crazy in every direction , though he did not see the three children . 
Asked Hermione . 
- What's at it ? 
Ron replied : 
- Looks like a harp . 
Presumably Snape's teacher left it . 
- When the music stops , the dog wakes up . okay , let's try 
Said Harry , putting Hagrid's flute on his lips and blowing . 
It's hard to say that it's a musical , but right from the first sound , the dog's eyes started to fall down . 
Harry held the flute for breath . 
The snarl of the dog calmed down , he staggered on four legs and knees , lying on the floor , sleeping . 
- Just blow it up ! 
Ron reminded Harry as they came out of the invisible cloak , crawling toward the trapdoor . 
When approaching the three heads of the giant monster , they can feel the hot and foul breath of the animal . 
Reaching the monster's back , Ron said , 
- I think all three partners can pull the door trap trapped out . 
You want to go before Hermione ? 
- I do not dare ! 
- okay ! 
Ron gritted his teeth carefully through the dog's legs . 
At the end of the trap pulls the trap ring , causing the trap mouth to open . 
Asked Hermione , 
- Do you see anything ? 
- There is no way down , we only water down . 
Harry was still fluttering , waving Ron to turn around and pointing at himself . 
Asked Ron : 
- You want to come down first ? 
Maybe no ? I do not know how deep this trap is ! 
Give the flute to Hermione so that she can continue to lull the dog to sleep ! 
Harry gave the flute to Hermione . 
The flute was silent for a second , the dog snarled again . 
But Hermione just started blowing as if she was asleep . 
Harry climbed over the dog , peering down at the trapdoor . 
There is no bottom . 
He dropped himself into the mouth of the probe , until he wore only a few finger fingers with his fingers clinging to the snare mouth , then he looked up at Ron and said : 
- If anything happens to me then you do not go down offline ! 
Go straight to the owl and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , remember ? 
Said Ron : 
- OK . 
- Hope to meet you again 
Harry let go of his hand . 
Cold air passes through it as it falls , falls , down , down again and again 
ALLOWED ! 
It fell on something soft , causing a very funny sound . 
Harry woke up around , his eyes familiar with the dark . 
It feels like sitting on a kind of grass . 
- It is ok ! 
Harry called up the little dot like a stamp above his head , which was his mouth . 
- You jump down , fall also quiet . 
Ron jumped right away . 
He dropped down , crawled to Harry's side , and asked : 
- What kind of breed ? 
- Do not know . 
A kind of herb . 
It must have been here to get some people down . 
Hermione , come down ! 
The music is far away . 
The dog barked . 
But Hermione had already jumped . 
She fell down beside Harry , saying : 
- I must be deep in my school for miles . 
Ron said : 
- Absolutely , there are trees here . 
- May ? - Hermione shrieked . 
- Look at you two ! 
Then it jumped up and clung to the damp wall . 
Hermione struggled as soon as her foot touched the grass , the vines began to bend like a serpent , wrapped around her ankles . 
Harry and Ron were wrapped up to the calf and tied in the grass without knowing it . 
Hermione tried to escape from the vines that were clinging to her . 
Then he looked up at the two boys struggling with grasses wrapped around the body , but the more waved the more vines were wrapped around faster and tighter . 
Hermione ordered : 
- do not move anymore ! 
I know what this game is - it is Tấm - grid - Sa - rise ! 
Ron grimaced : 
- Parents , oh , what is the name of what is what ? 
He was leaning back , trying to dodge the cords he'd been strangling . 
Hermione said : 
- Shut up ! I'm trying to remember how to destroy it . 
- Hurry up , I can not breathe anymore . 
The vines are wrapped around Harry's chest tight , making it struggling hard and gasping . 
Hermione murmured : 
- Sa plate is rising ! 
Sprout says it is dark and damp 
Harry gas : 
- Then fire up ! 
- Of course , but where to find firewood ? 
Hermione twisted her miserable hands . 
Shouted Ron : 
- WOULD YOU DIE ? DO YOU HAVE TO FISH ? 
- Yeah , right ! 
Hermione raised her wand , wiping her chopsticks and mumbling something . 
From the tip of the chopsticks emitted a series of blue bell - shaped fireflies like the one she used to burn Snape's coat . 
Within seconds , Harry and Ron felt loosened as the vines shrank in warm light . 
The ropes automatically wiggle and unwind to remove from the bodies of the children . 
So all three escape ! 
Harry jumped to the wall next to Hermione , sweat on his forehead , saying : 
- Thank you for your interest in Herbalism , Hermione . 
Ron : 
- Indeed . 
And fortunately , Harry was not mad at the crisis of finding firewood ! Honestly ! 
Harry pointed down a stone passage , the only way out of that place . 
It says : 
- This way ! 
They could hear the sound of water dropping from the cliff , but only the footsteps of them . 
The path that led Harry to remember Gringotts . 
His heart twirled as he thought of the dragons guarding the silver jaws of the witch's bank . 
Unfortunately , the three of us met a dragon now , a big dragon , Oh , the baby dragon Norbert was tired of it , anyway 
Ron whispered : 
- What did you hear ? 
Harry listens . 
There was a rattling sound that seemed to be nearing the top of them . 
- Is not it ? 
- I do not know it sounds like flapping wings . 
- In front of the light , I saw something moving . 
The children came to the end of the road and saw in front of them a room lit , high above their heads a dome - shaped ceiling filled with tiny , gleaming birds . 
Birds are flying around the room . At the other end of the room was a massive wooden door . 
Ron wondered : 
- Do you know the birds attack when you pass this room not ? 
Harry said : 
- Very dare . 
They are not aggressive , but if they sneak down at the same time . Well , there's no way I'm going to run across . 
He took a deep breath , wrapped his arms around his face , and darted through the room . 
He thought the pile of claws and the claws of the birds would tear it in a blink of an eye , but nothing happened . 
Harry reached the door safely . 
He twists his fist , but the door is locked . 
Hermione and Ron came to her side . 
They pulled each other and pushed the door , but the door did not move , even when Hermione used the charm of Alohomora . 
Asked Ron : 
- Now what ? 
Hermione said : 
- These birds are not here to be lions ! 
The head of the bird watching the sparkling birds - Well , sparkling ? 
Harry suddenly understood : 
- That is not the bird ! 
Which is the key ! 
Winged wires Look closely . 
So 
Harry looked around the room while the other two squinted his eyes . 
- Yes , look ! 
Bubbles ! 
I have to catch the door key ! 
- But there are hundreds of scams ! 
Ron considers the lock of the door : 
- We have to find a key , the old style is probably silver , like the door knob . 
Each of them grabbed a broom , jumped up and launched into the air , soared into the middle of the key cloud . 
They capture , catch , but the key has been spellbound , dive , slip so quickly that no prospect will catch a child . 
But Harry became the best young player of the century is not so good . 
It has the power to grab something that no one else can touch . 
After just a minute flying to the shuttle - like shuttle between the feathered wings of the keys , it recognizes a sparkling silver key with curved wings , as if one had been caught and pierced by a keyhole . roughly . 
He called the other two : 
- That ! 
That's so big ! 
No , over there There are two bright blue wings that one side of the feather is torn ! 
Ron hurried toward Harry , crashing into the ceiling , nearly jumping out of the broom . 
- We have to surround it . 
Harry called out , eyes still not leaving the key with the tassels . 
- Ron , you surrounded it above Hermione , you block it below , do not let it fly down I ' ll try to catch it . Okay , come on ! 
Ron collapsed , Hermione jumped up , the key latched from both hands , and Harry followed closely behind . 
She flew faster toward the wall , and Harry also dug into it , and with one hand pressed the unmodified key to the wall , causing a noisy sound like a rock . 
Ron and Hermione's cheers resounded in the high room . 
They hurried to the ground , Harry ran to the door with the key struggling in his hands . 
Harry put the key into the lock , it fit right in . 
As soon as the lock came out , the key to escape the fly away . 
Now , after two arrests , the key looked so pathetic . 
Harry laid his hand on the doorknob , asked two friends : 
- Ready ? 
Both nodded . 
Harry opened the door . 
The next room was so dark that they could not see anything . 
But as they entered , the light suddenly flooded , exposing a strange scene : 
They were standing on the sidelines of a great chessboard , behind the black chess pieces , which were all higher than they were and were carved from something like black stone . Standing on the opposite side of the room , facing the black pawn is the white flag . 
Harry , Ron and Hermione shivered sharply : those high white chess pieces were not present . 
Asked Harry , 
- What are we doing now ? 
Said Ron : 
- Too clear ? 
We have to play the game to get through this room . 
Behind the white chess is another door . 
Hermione worried : 
- What should I do ? 
Said Ron : 
- I think I should play the role of chess . 
It came near a black knight's arm , touching the knight's knight's arm . 
Immediately , the stone turns into a living . 
Horses knocking on the floor and the knight bowed his head and helmet down to Ron . 
- Do we have to play chess to pass the room ? 
Ron stammered . 
The black knight nodded . 
Ron turned to his two friends , saying : 
- This need to think here I think we need to place three black pawns 
Harry and Hermione stared at Ron thinking . 
Finally , Ron said , 
- Like this , do not have narcissism or anything , just because neither of you good at chess 
Harry said quickly : 
- We do not self - love anything , just tell us what to do is that we will do . 
" Well , Harry , you replaced the bishop , and Hermione , you go to Harry , take the place of the chess pieces . 
- And you ? 
- I will be knight's knight . 
The chess pieces seem to have been listening since , as Ron had just finished speaking , the tower chess pieces , the bishop and the knight turned their backs to the white chess pieces and stepped out of the chessboard , giving three boxes to Hermione , Harry and Ron stepped in . 
Ron looked up at the chessboard and said , 
- Usually white front . Yeah , yeah 
A good white go to two boxes . 
Ron begins to manipulate the black chess pieces . 
They quietly moved to where Ron sent them . Harry's knee trembled . 
What if their side loses ? 
- Harry ! cross the four boxes to the right . 
The real horror shakes them when another knight's side of his side is eaten . 
Queen of the white faction defeated the black knight on the floor and dragged him out of the game , he was lying on his stomach , silent , face down to the floor . 
Ron also looks shaken , but still says : 
- just accept it . To avoid the way for the episcopal missionary , Hermione , go away . 
Each time the black faction lost a piece , the white side does not show a bit pity . 
Soon there was a pile of deadly black chisels rolling down the wall . 
Twice , Ron almost pushed Hermione and Harry into a dangerous situation , luckily he realized . 
By itself , he kept the chessboard , eating almost all the white pieces , almost equal to the number of black pieces lost . 
Suddenly it murmured : 
- We are near the prime minister . Let me think , let me think 
The queen of the White Queen turns her head not facing her . 
Ron said softly : 
- so only the only way to test me . 
Harry and Hermione shouted : 
- ARE NOT ! 
Ron interrupted them : 
- Play the right chess . 
Accept some sacrifices . 
I will go one step further and be eaten by the Queen - so there will be room for the chappy shaman , Harry . 
- But 
- Do you want to stop Snape's hand ? 
- Ron 
- If you do not fast , he will take the stone . 
There is no other way . 
Ron's face was slightly pale but firm . 
She asked : 
- Ready ? 
I'm going to come here , once you win , do not go around here . 
He stepped forward , and the Queen mauled it . 
She banged Ron's head with a flick of his arm , and Ron rolled to the floor . 
Hermione cried but stood still . 
Mrs. Hoang pho white dragged Ron aside . 
Ron looked as if he had been touched . 
Harry shivered three cells to the left . 
The White King ripped his crown from his head and threw it at Harry's feet . 
Kids won . 
The chess pieces reached out and bowed , opening the empty path to the door in front of them . 
Desperate to look at Ron for the last time , Harry and Hermione stormed through the door and headed for the next hallway . 
- Know how if he 
- She's okay . 
Said Harry , trying to reassure himself . 
- What do you think , what's next ? 
- We have overcome the challenge of the teacher Sprout then , it is a grid of evil spirits ; The flying key must have been spotted by Flitwich ; Miss McGonagall would have turned the pieces into living people ; Only Quirrell's charm , and Snape's master . 
You came to another door . 
Harry whispered to Hermione , 
- Star ? 
- Go always ! 
Harry pushed the door open . 
A scorching odor on them , causing them to pull up their noses . 
Through tears , they saw a demon even louder than the demon before the encounter , lying flat on the floor in front of them , with a large lump of blood . 
The two carefully walked through one of the dumplings . 
Harry whispered : 
- We are glad that we are not fighting this demon . hurry up 
I can not breathe anymore . 
It opened the next door , and the two barely dared to look at the car , something was waiting for them . 
But it turned out there was nothing scary in this room . 
There was only one table with seven different shaped bottles standing in a row . 
Harry exclaimed : 
- Snape's game here . 
What should we do ? 
As they passed the threshold , a fire immediately flickered behind them , blocking the entrance . 
Not a normal fire ; it's purple . 
At the same time , on the way to the opposite door flared the black flames . 
The doors were blocked by fire , they were stuck . 
- Look ! 
Hermione took a roll of parchment lying next to the bottles . 
Harry read over Hermione's shoulder . 
In the face of danger , behind the back , 
Mi will find , two bottles of useful 
A bottle to drink , help me to speak 
One bottle to drink , you will go back 
Two of the seven , is the wine spirit 
Tea mixed in it , three bottles of poison . 
Choose a bottle , drink it , 
Unless you want to be stuck here . 
To help me , there are four suggestions : 
One is poison , though hid carefully 
It is easy to find ; 
Two are two bottles standing at both ends 
Different and do not help me voice ; 
Three , as you see , different sizes 
Little , giant , does not contain death 
Four are two bottles per head 
Taste is the same , see the other . 
Hermione breathed a sigh of relief and Harry was surprised to see her smiling , in this situation that gave him the gold he could not even smile . 
Hermione said : 
- Very smart ! 
This is not magic - this is just a speculative test : a puzzle ! 
Many great wizards do not have a reasoning mind , so they can get stuck here forever . 
- We ' ll be the same ! 
- No . 
Everything we need is in this paper . 
Seven bottles : Three bottles of poison , two bottles of wine , a bottle to help you safely pass the black fire , a bottle to pass the purple fire . 
- But I know how to drink a bottle ? 
- Give me a minute . 
Hermione repeatedly read the paper several times . 
Then she went up and down the bottles , pointing at them muttering alone . 
Finally she clapped her hands : 
- Know . 
The smallest bottle helps us cross the black fire , go to the Stone . 
Harry looked inside the tiny bottle . 
It says : 
- Just a little sip , not enough for both of us . 
The two looked at one another , and Harry asked , 
- Which bottle helps us pass the purple fire to return ? 
Hermione pointed at the round bottle at the end of the line . 
Harry said : 
- You drink that bottle . Do not argue , listen here : come back to save Ron . 
Grab the broom in the key room to fly out of the mouth of the trap , past the Fluffy - go straight to the owl and dispatch the Hedwig to call on Dumbledore . 
We need help . 
I could hold Snape's leg for a moment , but I was not really an opponent of him . 
" But if Harry - Who - well - know - who - is he next to him ? " 
- Then look at the bad luck ! 
I have been lucky once , see ? 
Harry pointed at the scar on his forehead , continued : 
- Maybe this time I am lucky again ! 
Hermione's lips trembled , and suddenly the little girl hugged Harry . 
- Hermione ! 
- Harry you know , you are a great witch . 
Harry was embarrassed when she let go of it . 
- I'm not as good as you ! 
- Me ? 
Hermione said : 
- I can only read and intelligent ! 
While there are more important things like friendship and courage Oh , Harry Be careful ! 
Harry said : 
- You drink first . 
You sure know the bottle , right ? 
- Sure . 
Hermione held the round bottle at the end , drank a long , shuddering breath . 
Harry thrilled : 
- Is it toxic ? 
- No - But it's as cold as ice . 
- Go away , lest drugs work . 
- Good luck . 
Watch out for Harry ! 
- go ! go ! 
Hermione turned and went straight through the purple flames . 
Harry took a deep breath , holding a small bottle . 
She turned her face to the black flame : 
- Here I come ! 
With a short squeeze , he drank the bottle . 
Indeed , it seems that ice is flowing in its body . 
Harry put the bottle down and stepped forward . 
It automatically self , feel the black fire is licking the body , but do not feel hot or burn anything . 
For a moment , he saw nothing but the black fire . 
And then , Hush ! It passed the other side - the last room . 
There were people in the room - but that was not Snape . 
Not Voldemort . 
Chapter 17 : TWO BODIES 
that is Quirrell . 
Harry gasped : 
- Master ! 
Quirrell smiled . 
His face did not twitch at all . 
He calmly said : 
- It's us . 
I wondered if I'd meet you here , Harry Potter . 
" But I thought , Snape . 
- Snape ? 
Quirrell laughed , not the slightest shaking of laughter , but a chilling laugh . 
" Oh , Snape seems like a ruthless guy , is not he ? 
To use the elderly to East West is not the same . 
If you suspect that Professor Quirrell carmaker - miser - miserable ? 
Harry could not believe it . That can not be true , it can not be ! 
- But Snape had killed him ! 
- No , no , no , I'm the one trying to kill you ! In the Quidditch match , your friend Hermione , hurrying to burn down Snape hit me , causing me to break the label with you , not only after a few seconds have fallen off the broom . 
It would have been possible to finish earlier if Snape did not continually read my curses , to save me . 
- Did Snape find a way to save me ? 
Quirrell said : 
- right . 
Did you think about why he asked to be the match referee later ? 
He wanted to make sure we could not repeat it . 
Funny . 
Actually , he does not need to work . 
I can not do anything when Dumbledore is sitting there watching . 
All the other teachers thought that Snape was trying to bully the Gryffindor , and that he had made himself more famous and wasted no time at all , because I was going to kill him the whole night . now on . 
Quirrell snapped his fingers . 
From the air , the ropes tied automatically to Harry . 
- You're so curious you can not let me live , Harry . 
Snooping around the school like the night of the Ma , so that you know you saw me go to the monster guard stone . 
- You released the giant demon ? 
- Who ? 
I have the talent to handle the devil . 
You must have seen the demon in the room over there . 
Unlucky that day , while others were running around to collect the demon , Snape , who had been suspicious of me before , went straight to the third floor before us . 
And not only did my demon not kill me , but the three - headed dog did not bite off Snape . 
Well , wait for a moment , Harry . 
We need to examine this interesting mirror . 
Only then did Harry realize what was behind Quirrell . That is the mirror image . 
Quirrell knocked his finger around the mirror frame and muttered : 
- This mirror is the key to finding the stone . 
Probably Dumbledore played this game , but he was in London , and he came to the place where we were high 
Harry could not think of anything other than the question , so that Quirrell kept talking , so he could not focus on the mirror . 
It pops the mouth : 
- I see you and Snape in the forest 
Quirrell replied casually : 
- it's correct . 
He walked around behind the mirror to look . 
" He went to see me that time , trying to find out where our plot progressed . 
He suspected me all the time . 
He threatened us - he thought he could do , when next to me there are my master , Mr. Voldemort 
Quirrell walked around from behind the mirror to the front , staring into the mirror with a look of haze . 
- I see the stone I'm giving it to my master , but where is it ? 
Harry struggled in the ring that was tied to him . 
But no way to make the loops loose . 
He had to make sure Quirrell could not put his mind to the mirror . 
- But Snape always hates me ? 
Quirrell replied calmly : 
- Oh , he hated it . 
God knows , Snape's father and aunt studied together at Hogwarts School , both hate each other . 
But honestly , he did not want me dead . 
- But a few days ago , I heard the teacher cry I thought Snape threatened him 
For the first time , a faint glimpse of Quirrell's face , he said , 
- Sometimes we find it difficult to carry out our instructions . 
He was a great witch , while I was too weak 
Harry gasped . 
- You said he was in the classroom with you then ? 
Quirrell quietly replied : 
- He is with us wherever we go . 
We meet him when we are going around the world . 
At that time I was a foolish young man , full of ideas of good , bad . 
Mr. Voldemort showed us how wrong we were . In this life , there is no good nor bad , only power , and the weak ones will not hold the power . Since then , I have faithfully served him , though many times he has disappointed me . . 
He had to be very strict with me . 
Suddenly Quirrell shivered . 
- He did not easily overlook the mistake . 
When I did not steal the Stone of Gringotts , he was very upset . 
He punished me for deciding to monitor me more closely 
Quirrell's voice is lost . 
Harry is recalling his shopping trip at Crossroads . 
How can it be so stupid ? 
He saw Professor Quirrell on the same day , shaking hands with him in the pub Leaky Cauldron . 
Quirrell was still angry at the curse : 
- I do not understand the stone inside the mirror . 
Should I break it ? 
Harry's racing . 
He thought : 
- At this time , what I desire more than anything in this life is to find the stone in front of Quirrell . 
So if I look in the mirror I will find myself finding it - that is , I will see where it is hidden . 
But how can I see without letting Quirrell see me ? 
He tried to move to the left , to stand in front of the mirror without being noticed by Quirrell . 
But the rope tied her legs so tight that it tripped and rolled . 
Quirrell wore Harry's body . 
He was muttering to himself : 
- What is this mirror used to do ? 
How to use it ? 
Please boss help me with ! 
A voice reply to Harry afraid of losing all hands . 
That voice seems to emit the word 
Quirrell . 
- Use the boy to use the boy 
Quirrell turned to Harry . 
- Yes ! 
Harry Come back ! 
He clapped his hands together , the rope tied to Harry's hand and fell off . 
Harry slowly stood up . 
Quirrell repeats : 
- Come here ! 
Look at the mirror and tell me what you see . 
Harry walked toward him . 
It desperately ponders : 
- I have to lie . 
I have to look and lie about what I see , that's all . 
Quirrell stood behind him . 
Harry smelled something funny , apparently radiating from the towel wrapped around his head . 
He closed his eyes , walked to the front of the mirror , and opened his eyes . 
He saw his image in the mirror , at first in pale , panic to no longer the spirit . 
But just a moment later , his picture smiled at him . 
The photo put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a bloody red stone . 
Blink of an eye with it and then store the stone in a pocket . 
And when the picture was taken , Harry felt something fell into his real bag . 
So somehow - I can not believe it - Harry got the Stone . 
Quirrell asked impatiently : 
- Star ? 
What do you see ? 
Harry cut off the courage . 
It made : 
- I see you shake hands with Dumbledore . 
She won the Cup for Gryffindor . 
Quirrell cries again . 
- Get out of the way ! 
As Harry stepped aside , he felt the Magic Stone touch his thigh . 
He is afraid of breaking the stone . 
But it was not five steps yet a shrill voice came from Quirrell , though his lips did not move . 
- It lied it lied 
Quirrell says : 
- Harry , come back here . 
Tell me , what do you see ? 
The voice shrieked again : 
- to talk to it face to face 
- Sir , you are not strong enough . 
- I am strong enough to do this 
Harry felt as if the net of the devil was gripping it in place . 
It can not move to a muscle . 
He stood like a rock and watched Quirrell raise his hand on the towel , and began to take off the towel . 
What's happening ? 
The headband fell . 
With no towels , Quirrell's head looked tiny . 
He turned his back slowly . 
Harry screamed horrified , but he did not say a word . 
Behind Quirrell's skull , there was another face - the most horrifying face Harry had ever seen . 
It is white as powder , with bright red eyes and a nose tucked out , looking like a snake . 
That face whispered : 
- Harry Potter 
Harry tried to step back but his legs could not move . 
The face says : 
- See you this farm ? 
It's just the ball I'm just the shape when I enter someone's body but there's always someone willing to put my heart into their mind The blood of the cysts has made me stronger in the past few weeks You've seen See Quirrell faithfully drink blood for us in the forest . And once we get the Immortal , we will be able to create a body now give us the stone in your pocket . 
So he knew . 
Feeling suddenly revived in Harry's leg , it jumps back . 
Face growling : 
- do not be stupid . 
You're best to keep your life and follow my side If you do not , you ' ll have to end your life as your parents died while begging for pity . 
- LIE ! 
Harry screamed loudly . 
Quirrell stepped back to Harry , leaving Voldemort still able to see Harry . 
The evil face now smiled , but his voice was hissing : 
- Sensitive I always appreciate bravery Yes , baby boy , your parents are brave I kill your father first , and he bravely resist but your mother does not really need to die I want to protect you if you do not want your mother's death to be in vain then give me the stone . 
- NEVER ! 
Harry hurried toward the burning fire door , but Voldemort yelled : 
- CATCH IT ! 
And just in case , Harry felt Quirrell's hand clench his wrist . 
Immediately a pain like a needle pierced the scar on Harry's forehead ; its head is about to break in half ; he screamed at all his strength , and strangely , Quirrell suddenly let go of his hand . 
The pain on Harry's head softened somewhat . 
He glanced around , saw Quirrell being knocked out , squirmed with pain , eyes looking at his fingers : they blistered . 
Voldemort hissed again : 
- Catch it ! CATCH IT ! 
Quirrell rushes forward , knocking Harry down , squeezing him , squeezing his arms around Harry's neck . 
Harry's scar made it so painful that it blossomed , but he could see Quirrell scream in pain : 
- Boss , I can not hold it . My hand , my hand 
And Quirrell , though , held Harry firmly to the floor with his knees , still having to let go of his neck . 
He looked horrified at his hands - Harry could see his hands burned , red , glossy . 
Voldemort shouted : 
- Then kill it , you fool , kill it ! 
Quirrell raised his hand to execute a deadly curse ; but Harry , by his instinctive instinct , had set his face on Quirrell 
- AAAAAAÁÁÁ . 
Quirrell rolled away from Harry , his face blistering ; And then Harry suddenly understood that Quirrell could not touch his naked skin without suffering terrible pain . 
So the only way to save it was to hang on to Quirrell , so he could be so painful that he could not do the murder . 
Harry stood up , grabbed Quirrell's arm and stiffly grabbed Quirrell , who was crying so hard , trying to knock Harry out . 
The pain on Harry's head was so intense - it hurt so much that he could not see anything anymore , only to hear the screaming Quirrell and the screams of Voldemort : KILLED IT ! KILL IT ! 
At the same time , he also heard other voices , perhaps in his own head , crying : Harry ! 
Harry ! 
He felt Quirrell's arm twitch out of his grasped hand . 
He knew it was all gone , and it fell into the deep darkness , falling down . 
Looks like something gold and sparkling is playing in front of Harry . 
Snitch ! 
He tried to capture , but his arms were too heavy to raise . 
He blinked . 
Turns out not a Snitch . 
Which is a pair of glasses . 
How strange ! 
He blinked again . 
Above , in front of him , was the smiling face of Albus Dumbledore . 
He said : 
- Good morning , Harry ! 
Harry looked at the teacher . 
Then he remembered : 
- Sir ! 
Rock ! 
Master Quirrell ! 
He stole the stone ! 
Teacher , hurry up 
Dumbledore said : 
- Calm down , my son , I'm a bit out of the situation . 
Quirrell did not get the Stone . 
- Then who ? 
Teacher , son 
- Harry , please relax a little , otherwise Mrs. Pomfrey will throw you out of here . 
Harry swallowed and looked around . 
He realized he was lying in a void . 
It was laid on a white bed , and next door was a table full of things that looked like half a candy store . 
Dumbledore radiant : 
- Gifts of the admirers and friends that he . 
What happened between you and Professor Quirrell in the basement is completely secret , so of course the whole school knows all ! 
I believe the toilet is our friend Fred and George Weasley's favor in favor . 
They think they are good . 
However , Pomfrey felt that it was not hygienic , so she confiscated it . 
- How long have you been here ? 
- Three days . 
Ron and Hermione would have been mildly aware that they were awake , and they were very worried . 
- But teacher , stone 
- You look so hard to make you forget good , Stone story . 
Professor Quirrell was unable to obtain the stone of the child . 
You came to the right time to stop it , though you must say that you yourself have done it well . 
- Have you come ? 
You received Hermione's owl ? 
- Exactly , I met an owl in the sky . 
As soon as he arrived in London , he knew immediately where he should be where he had just left . 
He came just in time to pull Quirrell out of the child . 
- Master ? 
- At that time I thought I was too late 
- I was really late , at that time I could not hold the stone longer 
- Not the rock , son , you are talking about me - the strength that you slope almost killed me . 
That horrible moment , he fears it can happen . 
And the stone , it was destroyed . 
- Destruction ? 
Harry asked , 
But his friend Nicolas Flamel 
- Ah , you know about Nicolas Flamel ? 
Dumbledore's voice was happy . 
- Have you figured out the drums ? 
Nicolas and I had a little talk , and agreed that destroying it was the best . 
" But that means that Flamel and his wife will die , right ? 
- They have enough medicine to stock up on their jobs , then , well , they will die . 
Looking at Harry's bewildered face , Dumbledore smiled : 
- For a young man like me , you must have heard that incredible , but for Nicolas and Perenelle , it was like going to bed after a long , long , long day . 
After all , for a well - organized mind , death is like another great adventure . 
You know , Rock is not really a great treasure . 
Have lots of money and live as long as you want ! 
Two things most people choose - the trouble is that the talented people choose the worst things for them . 
Harry lay there , closed his eyes . 
Dumbledore mumbled a little and smiled at the ceiling . 
After a moment , Harry said , 
- Sir ! 
I was thinking , Teacher , even if the stone was destroyed , then Vol , mind forget , Who - ai - also 
- Call him Voldemort , Harry . 
Always use the right name to call the right things . 
Fear of a name can add to the fear of the thing . 
- Yes , sir . 
Then Voldemort will look for other ways to return , right ? I mean he is not dead , teacher ? 
- No , he's not dead yet , Harry . 
He is still hovering somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to enter He did not live properly , then he can not get it . 
He escapes Quirrell's corpse , having no mercy on that disciple than an enemy . 
However , Harry , as you prevented him from holding power , someone else is preparing to fight for the next battle , a live match - and if he gets stuck again , and again , yeah , he can never regain his strength . 
Harry nodded , but stopped short , because his head ached . 
Then he said : 
" Teacher , there are things I want you to tell me the truth about what you want to know ? 
Dumbledore sighed : 
- Truth . That is a beautiful and terrible thing , so consider the truth very carefully . 
However , he will answer the child's questions unless he has a good reason not to answer . 
In that case , I'm sorry , because you do not want to lie , of course . 
- Voldemort said he killed his mother just because his cheeks tried to stop him from killing him . 
But why would he want to kill you ? 
This time Dumbledore breathed a bit longer than before : 
- My God , I can not answer your first question you raised . 
You can not tell me today , can not say now . 
One day you will know . Now , forget it . Harry . 
When you grow up you know I hate hearing this but you will know when you are ready . 
Now , Harry knew there was no argument at all . 
- But why can not Mr. Quirrell touch me ? 
- My mother died to save me . 
If there is one thing Voldemort can not understand , it is love . 
He did not know , that the power of love as the love of the cheeks left a trace . 
Not a scar , not a visible sign of being loved deeply , even if your loved one has died , you will also be protected forever . 
So Quirrell , who is full of hatred , greed , and ambition , who shares his soul with Voldemort , can not touch me . Touching a person is a great thing as the mother's love of protection , he will be extremely painful . 
Dumbledore suddenly noticed some bird parked on the window , so Harry admit at that time pull the sheets wipe the tears . 
Kh fever touched , Harry asked : 
- Invisible coat - do you know who sent it ? 
- By accident , my daddy sent the suit to the master , and he thought maybe I liked it . 
Dumbledore's eyes sparkle : 
- It's so useful that when your three children learn here , your three children still use that invisibility cloak to sneak down to the kitchen . 
- One more thing 
- Just say it . 
- Quirrell and Snape 
" You should call Professor Snape , Harry ! " 
- Yes , Professor Snape . 
Quirrell said he hated me for hating my three children , right ? 
- Oh , they hate each other bitterly . 
It's just like me and Malfoy . 
Then my dad made one thing that Snape could not forgive . 
- What , what ? 
- Savior Snape . 
- What ? 
Dumbledore said dreamily : 
- The head thinks very funny . 
Professor Snape could not stand the thought that he was in debt to three children . He believed Snape was so hard on his guard to level the score with three children . So then Snape could continue to hate the three in peace 
Harry tried to understand this , but it only made his head aching , so it was not . 
- Teacher , there is one more thing 
- One ? 
- How did the stone from the mirror fall into the bag ? 
- Ah , here , please listen to me ask this question . That is one of the bright ideas of the teacher , and the teacher said that the story is good . 
I see , only people who want to find the Stone - find it , not use it - can get it . 
On the contrary , people only find themselves are making gold or taking drugs Antibiotic . Sometimes my mind makes me even surprised . Well , that's enough . 
I suggest you start eating candy . 
Wow , the candy is full of Bertie Bott . 
When I was a kid , I was so hungry that I had a taste for vomit , and since then I'm afraid I've lost the inspiration for them . But you thought a good caramel candy would be fine , would not you ? 
He smiled and whipped brown candy in his mouth . 
But he choked and said : 
- Miracle , it is rotten ears ! 
Mrs. Pomfrey , the nurse , was a kind but strict man . 
Harry pleaded with her : 
- Only five minutes ! 
- Definitely not . 
- But she sent Dumbledore 
- Yeah , of course , that's different , that's the principal . 
I need a break . 
- Then I'm resting , you see , I lay down and do nothing . 
Dear , give her 
- OK , but only five minutes alone . 
So she gave Hermione and Ron in . 
- Harry ! 
Hermione seemed to be hugging Harry again , but the little girl managed to control herself and Harry was glad that his head was still hurt . 
- Oh , Harry ! 
We thought you were going away and Mr. Dumbledore was scared . 
Said Ron : 
- The whole school is talking about it . 
Tell us , what exactly is it ? 
Rare case where the story is still more strange and thrilling story than the mythical myth as this case . 
Harry tells you everything : Quirrell , Mirror , Stone , and Voldemort . 
Ron and Hermione are the ideal listeners ; They gasped , holding their breath in time , and when Harry mentioned when Quirrell pulled the headband off to reveal his face , Hermione screamed . 
Finally , Ron said , 
- So the stone was destroyed ? 
Flamel only dead ? 
- I said that too , but what is Dumbledore thinking ? For a well - organized head , death is like another great adventure . 
Ron was deeply touched by the insanity of idols . 
It says : 
- I always say it's crazy . 
Harry asked again . 
- What about the two of you , what happened ? 
Hermione said : 
- Well , I'm back safe . 
I wake up Ron - it also takes a while . 
Then they rushed to the stables to contact Dumbledore , and he met the master at the entrance to the Hall . 
Master just said : he chase after him ? 
He went up to the third floor . 
Ron suddenly asked : 
" Do you think Dumbledore intended to do that to you ? " 
Try to think of : send them your invisibility cloak and other things . 
Hermione was angry : 
- life ! 
If you do that - I say the truth - so terrible you can die that sure ! 
Harry whispered : 
- No . 
Dumbledore is funny . 
I think he would like to give me a chance . 
I'm sure you know a lot of things going on in Hogwarts Castle . 
I deduce that you know what we are going to do , but instead of forbidding us , you teach us just enough to handle it . 
It was not by accident that he let me discover the mirror . 
Maybe you think I have the right to confront Voldemort if I am fit 
Ron said with pride : 
- yes , Mr. Dumbledore is a bit crazy , okay . 
Now listen : tomorrow you must attend the end of the school year . 
Of course the Slytherin had the highest score - you missed the last Quidditch match , without you , your home team was crushed by Ravenlaw . 
But the food is still good . 
Just then Mrs. Pomfrey rushed in : 
- You have already spent fifteen minutes . RIGHT NOW ! 
After a sleep , Harry almost recovered . 
She told Pomfrey when she arranged the boxes of candy . 
- I want to go to a party , are you allowed to go ? 
- Professor Dumbledore said I was allowed to attend . 
Mrs. Pomfrey responded with a reluctant voice , as if she thought Dumbledore was not aware of how dangerous the party was . 
- You have another guest . 
- Oh , that's great . 
Who are you ? 
Harry said as Hagrid walked shyly through the door . 
As usual , when the room was empty , the room was cramped . 
He sat down next to Harry , looking at him and crying . 
He put his face to his hands , sobbing : 
- Only in your stupid mistake ! 
You told the demon how to get Fluffy ! 
Uncle told him ! That was the only thing he did not know , but he told him ! 
I almost killed you . 
Just for a dragon egg ! 
You will never drink again ! Should be expelled to live as a Muggle ! 
- Uncle Hagrid ! 
Harry was shocked to see that Hagrid was too moved by grief and regret . 
The huge tears fell down his great beard . 
" Uncle Hagrid , he's found a way . 
Voldemort . 
Even though I did not tell Quirrell , Voldemort found another way . 
Hagrid was still crying : 
- I almost died . 
And do not mention that name . 
Harry screamed : 
- VOLDEMORT ! 
Hagrid was scared , crying . 
Harry said : 
- I touched him and called him his name . 
Uncle Hagrid , cheer up . 
We stopped him , destroyed the Stone . 
He can not use it to gain power . 
Uncle Frog Chickens , I have a heap 
Hagrid wiped his nose with his left hand and said , 
- Another is forget . 
You also have gifts for me . 
Harry asked nervously : 
- Mussel meat ? 
Hagrid laughed softly : 
- No . Dumbledore gave us a day off to prepare it . He would just chase her off the course , of course , but , here , there is this for the child . 
Hagrid's gift was like a pretty leather jacket . 
Harry opened curiously . 
The light is full of witches . Every page has a picture of his father and his cheek with a waving smile . 
- Uncle sent to all the old schoolmates of the three children to beg Uncle picture you do not have any pictures Do you like it ? 
Harry could not speak , but Hagrid understood . 
That evening , Harry went down alone for the closing party at the end of the school year . 
Mrs. Pomfrey kept it to do what she called a final health check , so when it arrived the Great Hall was full of people . 
The colorful Slytherin party - green and silver - celebrates the Slytherin who has won the Home Cup for seven consecutive years . 
A large Slytherin python banner hangs over a wall behind a high table for teachers . 
Suddenly there was a sound as Harry came in , and then at the same time , loudly . 
Harry rushed to a seat between Hermione and Ron at the Gryffindor table , trying not to notice that everyone was standing up to look at it . 
Fortunately , only a moment later Dumbledore came . 
The whisper is down . 
Dumbledore said cheerfully : 
- Another school year is over ! 
And I disturbed you with the harsh words of an old man before we even went out to dinner for this delectable dinner . 
How great a school year is . 
Now , your initial hopes were better than last year . The kids had a summer ahead of them to dump the garbage in their heads and make their heads cool before the year began . 
- Now , as far as I know , it's time to give the Cup home and the score is like this : fourth is Gryffindor , 312 points ; Third place is Hufflepeff , 352 points ; Ravenclaw received 426 points ; And Slytherin was 472 points . 
A storm shouted and stomped on the Slytherin table . 
Harry could see Malfoy knocking his cup down on the victory table . 
Look at that scene that liver . 
Dumbledore continued : 
- okay , okay , Slytherin , good job . 
But the recent happenings also need to be counted . 
Listen to that , the whole Hall suddenly silent . 
The Slytherin student's smile wilted slightly . 
- Ahem ! 
There are some points - hours - last I would like to be announced . to consider . Here's the first point for Ron Weasley 
Ron's face was red ; It looks like a radish exposed to the sun . 
- For playing Hogwarts most of the game for many years back here . 
I reward the Gryffindor 50 points . 
Gryffindor students cheered for the ceiling to be spellbound ; Stars on the high seemed to shiver . Where's the head chef Percy told the other leaders : 
- You know , my brother ! 
My youngest brother that ! 
It won Professor McGonagall's colossal game . 
Finally , the order was repeated , the hallway rolled again like a sheet . 
- Second - points to Hermione Granger for using inference when confronted with fire . 
I reward the Gryffindor 50 points . 
Hermione reached into her arms ; Harry believed she was crying . 
Next to them were Gryffindor students dancing all over the table shouting - we have increased a hundred points already . 
- Third - points for Harry Potter professor Dumbledore continued . 
The Hall so quietly that no one dared breathe . 
- because of pure emotion and courage . 
I reward the Gryffindor 60 points . 
The loud noise in the hall deafened the ear . 
The cheering and screaming contributors knew that Gryffindor now had 472 points - the correct Slytherin score . 
The two are in the same competition in the Cup . 
God , if Dumbledore gave Harry another point , was it ? 
Dumbledore raised his hand . 
The hall was silent . 
Dumbledore said with a smile : 
- Have the kind of courage . Stand up against the enemy naturally need a lot of courage , but struggling with friends also need courage . 
So I rewarded Neville Longbottom with 10 points . 
If someone was standing outside the Great Hall at that time , that person would have thought there was a terrible explosion inside , as the cheers fluttered from the Gryffindor table . 
Harry , Ron , and Hermione both shouted at Neville . 
Neville's face was white with emotion , and vanished in the arms of his friends hugging him . 
Any time Neville has ever earned for the Gryffindor so many points . 
Harry , being so excited , poked Ron into Ron's lap to show you his ghost , was so excited , poked Ron into the ribs to show him he saw Malfoy . 
If Malfoy was hit by the Curse of the Truth , he would not be as lethargic and look so terrified . 
Dumbledore had to storm the storm , because even the Hufflepeff and Ravenclaw were celebrating the Slytherin championship . Dumbledore said : 
- So , we need to change the decoration a little . 
Applause 
At a glance , the green decorations turn purple , silver turns golden ; The giant python - the Slytherin symbol - disappears , and into it the lioness of the Gryffindor Tower . 
Snape was shaking hands with Professor McGonagall with a terrible smile that he tried to twist . 
He caught Harry's eyes and Harry knew that his feelings for him had not changed at all . 
But that did not make Harry anxious . 
It seems that life in Hogwarts will return as normal next school year , as it is now . 
That night was the most beautiful night in Harry's life , better than the day he'd won the Quidditch match , or Christmas Eve , or the beating of a giant demon . It would never , never forget tonight . 
Harry almost forgot that he did not know the results of the exam . 
But the result was immediate : how surprised - Harry and Ron both scored high ; Hermione is of course the best . 
Even Neville crossed the hallway , earning a high point in herbal medicine , which compensated for a bad poison score . 
They hoped that Goyle , who was just as foolish as he was , would be kicked out of school . 
Where he was also nuts ! 
This is humiliating . 
But , as Ron says , I can not get everything in my life ! 
Then suddenly their closet was empty , and the chests filled themselves , and Neville's toad was found naturally in the middle of the toilets ; Every student receives a notice , warning them not to use magic in the summer . ( Fred Weasley said , " I always hope they forget about this . " ) ; Hagrid was ready to take them down the boat to glide across the lake ; They will return to the Hogwarts Express ; laughing while the countryside outside is becoming increasingly green and more orderly ; Eat more gummy Bertie Bott as you drive past the Muggle towns ; and unmasked HCogwarts ' witch uniforms to wear on windbreakers and coats ; finally to Nine Three Fourth Station at King's Cross Station . 
The kids also took a long time to get out of the station : a witch doctor stood by the ticket bar , for only two or three out , so they would not get noticed . 
Muggle people may panic when they see a whole bunch of kids thrown out of a concrete wall at the same time . 
Said Ron : 
- This summer you have to go home to play the house . 
Both of you . 
I ' ll send the owl to you . 
Harry said : 
- Thank you . 
So there is something to look forward to ! 
Other students rushed over to the gate to return to the Muggle world . 
Some call : 
- Goodbye , Harry ! 
- See you , Potter ! 
Ron grinned at Harry : 
- You are still famous ! 
Harry said : 
" Here , not the place where I'm going , I assure you . 
Ron , Ron and Hermione walked through the gate for a moment . 
- Behold , that picture , my mother , look , look ! 
It was Ginny's whisper , Ron's youngest sister , but she did not point at her brother . 
She squealed : 
- Harry Potter ! 
Look , mama ! 
I see 
- Yen , Ginny , just pointing people like that is rude ! 
Mrs. Weasley smiled at the children . 
She asked kindly : 
- One school year too hard for children ? 
Harry replied , 
- Yes , hard work . 
I thank you for giving me warm clothes and candies . 
" Oh , what good is that ? 
- Are you done ? 
It was the voice of Uncle Vernon , still purple heart , still has a mustache , still angry look Harry carrying the cage in the middle of a platform full of normal people . Behind him was Aunt Petunia and Dudley , who had just seen Harry's face die . 
Ms . Weasley said : 
" You must be Harry's family ? " 
Uncle Vernon said : 
- In a way , that's true . 
Come on , kid , we do not have a whole day here ! 
He left . 
Harry left to say goodbye to Hermione and Ron : 
- See you at the end of summer ! 
Hermione looked at Vernon suspiciously , surprised by how uncomfortable it was . 
She said to Harry : 
- Wish you happy summer . 
Harry grinned , causing his friends to be very surprised . 
- Oh , I will be happy summer vacation . 
They did not know I was not allowed to do magic at home . 
This summer I will be happy with Dudley
